ultracold quantum gases offer unique possibilities to study interacting many - body quantum systems . probing and manipulating such systems with ever increasing degree of control requires novel experimental techniques . scanning electron microscopy is a high resolution technique which can be used for in situ imaging , single site addressing in optical lattices and precision density engineering . here , we review recent advances and achievements obtained with this technique and discuss future perspectives .
