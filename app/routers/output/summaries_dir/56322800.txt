we numerically evaluate the entanglement spectrum ( singular value decomposition of the wavefunction ) of paired states of fermions in two dimensions that break parity and time - reversal symmetries , focusing on the spin - polarized $ p_x+ip_y$ case . the entanglement spectrum of the weak - pairing ( bcs ) phase contains a majorana zero mode , indicating non - abelian topological order . in contrast , for the strong - pairing ( bec ) phase , we find no such mode , consistent with abelian topological order .
