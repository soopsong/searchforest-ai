temperature measurement with nano - kelvin resolution is demonstrated at room temperature , based on the thermal dependence of an optical crystal anisotropy in a high quality whispering gallery resonator . as the resonator 's te and tm modes frequencies have different temperature coefficients , their differential shift provides a sensitive measurement of the temperature variation , which is used for active stabilization of the temperature .
