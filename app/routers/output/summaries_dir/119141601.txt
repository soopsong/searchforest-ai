logarithmic representations of the conformal galilean algebra ( cga ) and the exotic conformal galilean algebra ( { \sc ecga } ) are constructed . this can be achieved by non - decomposable representations of the scaling dimensions or the rapidity indices , specific to conformal galilean algebras . logarithmic representations of the non - exotic cga lead to the expected constraints on scaling dimensions and rapidities and also on the logarithmic contributions in the co - variant two - point functions . on the other hand , the { \sc ecga } admits several distinct situations which are distinguished by different sets of constraints and distinct scaling forms of the two - point functions . two distinct realisations for the spatial rotations are identified as well . the first example of a reducible , but non - decomposable representation , without logarithmic terms in the two - point function is given .
