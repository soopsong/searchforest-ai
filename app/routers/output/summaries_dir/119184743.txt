we introduce a way of quantifying how informative a quantum measurement is , starting from a resource - theoretic perspective . this quantifier , which we call the robustness of measurement , describes how much ` noise ' must be added to a measurement before it becomes completely uninformative . we show that this geometric quantifier has operational significance in terms of the advantage the measurement provides over guessing at random in an suitably chosen state discrimination game . we further show that it is the single - shot generalisation of the accessible information of a certain quantum - to - classical channel . using this insight , we also show that the recently - introduced robustness of coherence is the single - shot generalisation of the accessible information of an ensemble . finally we discuss more generally the connection between robustness - based measures , discrimination problems and single - shot information theory .
