we study the mechanical stability of a tunable high - finesse microcavity under ambient conditions and investigate light - induced effects that can both suppress and excite mechanical fluctuations . as an enabling step , we demonstrate the ultra - precise electronic stabilization of a microcavity . we then show that photothermal mirror expansion can provide high - bandwidth feedback and improve cavity stability by almost two orders of magnitude . at high intracavity power , we observe self - oscillations of mechanical resonances of the cavity . we explain the observations by a dynamic photothermal instability , leading to parametric driving of mechanical motion . for an optimized combination of electronic and photothermal stabilization , we achieve a feedback bandwidth of $ 500\,$khz and a noise level of $ 1.1 \times 10^{-13}\,$m rms .
