it has been argued i ) that lorentz - signature solutions with wormholes connecting n asymptotically ads regions describe bulk quantum states dual to n entangled but non - interacting cfts and ii ) that such bulk wormhole states should be identified with similar entangled but non - interacting bulk systems , each describing quantum geometries with only a single asymptotic region . but if the wormhole is to behave semiclassically , we show that conjecture ( ii ) can not hold . instead , the theory of asymptotically ads bulk quantum gravity must admit superselection sectors with respect to the cft observables that are labeled by the type of wormhole connections allowed between black holes . moreover , these superselection sectors are indistinguishable in the dual cft . finally , we describe restrictions on the possible superselection sectors associated with the spin - statistics relation and the expectation that black holes lying in distinct asymptotically ads regions may be approximated by well - separated black holes in a single asymptotically ads region .
