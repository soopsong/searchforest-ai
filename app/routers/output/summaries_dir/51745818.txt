we present a detailed study of the spatial self - organization of laser - driven atoms in an optical cavity , an effect predicted on the basis of numerical simulations [ p. domokos and h. ritsch , phys . rev . lett . 89 , 253003 ( 2002 ) ] and observed experimentally [ a. t. black et al . , phys . rev . lett . 91 , 203001 ( 2003 ) ] . above a threshold in the driving laser intensity , from a uniform distribution the atoms evolve into one of two stable patterns that produce superradiant scattering into the cavity . we derive analytic formulas for the threshold and critical exponent of this phase transition from a mean - field approach . numerical simulations of the microscopic dynamics reveal that , on laboratory timescale , a hysteresis masks the mean - field behaviour . simple physical arguments explain this phenomenon and provide analytical expressions for the observable threshold . above a certain density of the atoms a limited number of ` ` defects ' ' appear in the organized phase , and influence the statistical properties of the system . the scaling of the cavity cooling mechanism and the phase space density with the atom number is also studied .
