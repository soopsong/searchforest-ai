we consider the dynamics of systems with arbitrary friction and diffusion . these include , as a special case , systems for which friction and diffusion are connected by einstein fluctuation - dissipation relation , e.g. brownian motion . we study the limit where friction effects dominate the inertia , i.e. where the mass goes to zero ( smoluchowski - kramers limit ) . { using the it\^o stochastic integral convention , } we show that the limiting effective langevin equations has different drift fields depending on the relation between friction and diffusion . { alternatively , our results can be cast as different interpretations of stochastic integration in the limiting equation } , which can be parametrized by $ \alpha \in \mathbb{r}$. interestingly , in addition to the classical it\^o ( $ \alpha=0 $ ) , stratonovich ( $ \alpha=0.5 $ ) and anti - it\^o ( $ \alpha=1 $ ) integrals , we show that position - dependent $ \alpha = \alpha(x)$ , and even stochastic integrals with $ \alpha \notin [ 0,1]$ arise . our findings are supported by numerical simulations .
