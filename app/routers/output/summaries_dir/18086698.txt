this paper extends the energy - based version of the stochastic linearization method , known for classical nonlinear systems , to open quantum systems with canonically commuting dynamic variables governed by quantum stochastic differential equations with non - quadratic hamiltonians . the linearization proceeds by approximating the actual hamiltonian of the quantum system by a quadratic function of its observables which corresponds to the hamiltonian of a quantum harmonic oscillator . this approximation is carried out in a mean square optimal sense with respect to a gaussian reference quantum state and leads to a self - consistent linearization procedure where the mean vector and quantum covariance matrix of the system observables evolve in time according to the effective linear dynamics . we demonstrate the proposed hamiltonian - based gaussian linearization for the quantum duffing oscillator whose hamiltonian is a quadro - quartic polynomial of the momentum and position operators . the results of the paper are applicable to the design of suboptimal controllers and filters for nonlinear quantum systems .
