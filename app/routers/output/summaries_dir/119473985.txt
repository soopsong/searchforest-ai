grover 's search algorithm is the optimal quantum algorithm that can search an unstructured database quadratically faster than any known classical algorithm . the role of entanglement and correlations in the search algorithm have been studied in great detail and it is known that entanglement between the qubits is necessary to gain a quadratic speedup , for pure state implementation of the grover search algorithm . here , we systematically investigate the behavior of quantum coherence and monogamy of entanglement in the discrete analogue of the $ \textit{analog analogue of grover search algorithm}$. the analog analogue of grover search is a continuous time quantum algorithm based on the adiabatic hamiltonian evolution that gives a quadratic speedup , similar to the original grover search algorithm . we show that the decrease of quantum coherence , quantified using various coherence monotones , is a clear signature of attaining the maximum success probability in the analog grover search . we also show that for any two qubit reduced density matrix of the system , the concurrence evolves in close vicinity to the increasing rate of success probability . furthermore , we show that the system satisfies a $ n$-party monogamy inequality for arbitrary times , hence bounding the amount of $ n$-qubit entanglement during the quantum search .
