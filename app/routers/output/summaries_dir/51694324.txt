we investigate spontaneous and pumped entanglement of two level systems in the vicinity of a photonic topological insulator interface , which supports a nonreciprocal ( unidirectional ) , scattering - immune and topologically - protected surface plasmon polariton in the bandgap of the bulk material . to this end , we derive a master equation for qubit interactions in a general three - dimensional , nonreciprocal , inhomogeneous and lossy environment . the environment is represented exactly , via the photonic green function . the resulting entanglement is shown to be extremely robust to defects occurring in the material system , such that strong entanglement is maintained even if the interface exhibits electrically - large and geometrically sharp discontinuities . alternatively , depending on the initial excitation state , using a non - reciprocal environment allows two qubits to remain unentangled even for very close spacing . the topological nature of the material is manifest in the insensitivity of the entanglement to variations in the material parameters that preserve the gap chern number . our formulation and results should be useful for both fundamental investigations of quantum dynamics in nonreciprocal environments , and technological applications related to entanglement in two - level systems .
