we establish a generic method to analyze the time evolution of open quantum many - body systems . our approach is based on a variational integration of the quantum master equation describing the dynamics and naturally connects to a variational principle for its nonequilibrium steady state . we successfully apply our variational method to study dissipative rydberg gases , finding excellent quantitative agreement with small - scale simulations of the full quantum master equation . we observe that correlations related to non - markovian behavior play a significant role during the relaxation dynamics towards the steady state . we further quantify this non - markovianity and find it to be closely connected to an information - theoretical measure of quantum and classical correlations .
