quantum data is inherently fragile and must be protected to unlock the potential of quantum technologies . a pertinent concern in schemes for quantum storage is their potential to be implemented in the near future . while heisenberg ferromagnets are readily available and can be potentially implemented , quantum storage in them has never before been addressed . we address this issue by considering the storage of quantum data within a special quantum ferromagnet , where every pair of spins interacts with equal strength . we analyze the storage error for a unital and local noise model , and optimize the memory lifetime with respect to system size . our analysis relies on taylor decompositions of unitary evolutions in terms of fr{\'e}chet matrix derivatives , and uses davis ' divided difference representation for these fr{\'e}chet derivatives , and the recursive structure of these divided differences . we thereby obtain upper bounds on the error for passive quantum storage . with our bounds , we numerically study the potential to enhance memory lifetimes . our approach lays the foundation for optimization of the memory lifetime based on the spectral structure of any physical system .
