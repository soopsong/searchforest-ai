parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) offers the possibility to control the fabrication of non - gaussian states such as fock states . however , in conventional pdc sources energy and momentum conservation introduce strict frequency and photon number correlations , which impact the fidelity of the prepared state . in our work we optimize the preparation of single - photon fock states from the emission of waveguided pdc via spectral filtering . we study the effect of correlations via photon number resolving detection and quantum interference . our measurements show how the reduction of mixedness due to filtering can be evaluated . interfering the prepared photon with a coherent state we establish an experimentally measured fidelity of the produced target state of 78 % .
