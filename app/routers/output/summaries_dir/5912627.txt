we consider a free particle coupled with finite strength to a bath and investigate the evaluation of its specific heat . a harmonic oscillator bath of drude type with cutoff frequency omega_d is employed to model an ohmic friction force with dissipation strength gamma . two scenarios for obtaining specific heat are presented . the first one uses the measurement of the kinetic energy of the free particle while the second one is based on the reduced partition function . both descriptions yield results which are consistent with the third law of thermodynamics . nevertheless , the two methods produce different results that disagree even in their leading quantum corrections at high temperatures . we also consider the regime where the cutoff frequency is smaller than the friction strength , i.e. omega_d < gamma . there , we encounter puzzling results at low temperatures where the specific heat based on the thermodynamic prescription becomes negative . this anomaly is rooted in an ill - defined density of states of the damped free particle which assumes unphysical negative values when gamma / omega_d>1 .
