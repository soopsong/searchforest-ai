we discuss a hybrid quantum system where a dielectric membrane situated inside an optical cavity is coupled to a distant atomic ensemble trapped in an optical lattice . the coupling is mediated by the exchange of sideband photons of the lattice laser , and is enhanced by the cavity finesse as well as the square root of the number of atoms . in addition to observing coherent dynamics between the two systems , one can also switch on a tailored dissipation by laser cooling the atoms , thereby allowing for sympathetic cooling of the membrane . the resulting cooling scheme does not require resolved sideband conditions for the cavity , which relaxes a constraint present in standard optomechanical cavity cooling . we present a quantum mechanical treatment of this modular open system which takes into account the dominant imperfections , and identify optimal operation points for both coherent dynamics and sympathetic cooling . in particular , we find that ground state cooling of a cryogenically pre - cooled membrane is possible for realistic parameters .
