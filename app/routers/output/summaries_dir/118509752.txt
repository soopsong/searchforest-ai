we prove that the closest gaussian state to an arbitrary $ n$-mode field state through the relative entropy is built with the covariance matrix and the average displacement of the given state . consequently , the relative entropy of an $ n$-mode state to its associate gaussian one is an exact distance - type measure of non - gaussianity . in order to illustrate this finding , we discuss the general properties of the $ n$-mode fock - diagonal states and evaluate their exact entropic amount of non - gaussianity .
