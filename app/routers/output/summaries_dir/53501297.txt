we study perfect state transfer in kendon 's model of discrete quantum walks . in particular , we give a characterization of perfect state transfer purely in terms of the graph spectra , and construct an infinite family of $ 4$-regular circulant graphs that admit perfect state transfer . prior to our work , the only known infinite families of examples were variants of cycles and diamond chains .
