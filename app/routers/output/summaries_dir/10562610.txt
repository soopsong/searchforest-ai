in this paper , a quantum filter for estimating the states of a non - markovian qubit system is presented in an augmented markovian system framework including both the qubit system of interest and multi - ancillary systems for representing the internal modes of the non - markovian environment . the colored noise generated by the multi - ancillary systems disturbs the qubit system via a direct interaction . the resulting non - markovian dynamics of the qubit is determined by a memory kernel function arising from the dynamics of the ancillary system . in principle , colored noise with arbitrary power spectrum can be generated by a combination of lorentzian noises . hence , the quantum filter can be constructed for the qubit disturbed by arbitrary colored noise and the conditional state of the qubit system can be obtained by tracing out the multi - ancillary systems . an illustrative example is given to show the non - markovian dynamics of the qubit system with lorentzian noise .
