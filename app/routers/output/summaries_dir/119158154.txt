we consider the effects of entanglement in the initial quantum state of scalar and tensor fluctuations during inflation . we allow the gauge - invariant scalar and tensor fluctuations to be entangled in the initial state and compute modifications to the various cosmological power spectra . we compute the angular power spectra ( $ c_l$ 's ) for some specific cases of our entangled state and discuss what signals one might expect to find in cmb data . this entanglement also can break rotational invariance , allowing for the possibility that some of the large scale anomalies in the cmb power spectrum might be explained by this mechanism .
