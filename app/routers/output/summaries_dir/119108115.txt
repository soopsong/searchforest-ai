we design photonic crystal waveguides with efficient chiral light -- matter interfaces that can be integrated with solid - state quantum emitters . by using glide - plane - symmetric waveguides , we show that chiral light - matter interaction can exist even in the presence of slow light with slow - down factors of up to $ 100 $ and therefore the light -- matter interaction exhibits both strong purcell enhancement and chirality . this allows for near - unity directional $ \beta$-factors for a range of emitter positions and frequencies . additionally , we design an efficient mode adapter to couple light from a standard nanobeam waveguide to the glide - plane symmetric photonic crystal waveguide . our work sets the stage for performing future experiments on a solid - state platform .
