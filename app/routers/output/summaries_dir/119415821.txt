we analyze in details a scheme for cloning of gaussian states based on linear optical components and homodyne detection recently demonstrated by u. l. andersen et al . [ prl 94 240503 ( 2005 ) ] . the input - output fidelity is evaluated for a generic ( pure or mixed ) gaussian state taking into account the effect of non - unit quantum efficiency and unbalanced mode - mixing . in addition , since in most quantum information protocols the covariance matrix of the set of input states is not perfectly known , we evaluate the average cloning fidelity for classes of gaussian states with the degree of squeezing and the number of thermal photons being only partially known .
