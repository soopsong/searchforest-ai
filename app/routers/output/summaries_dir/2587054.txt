we show a parallel repetition theorem for the entangled value $ \omega^*(g)$ of any two - player one - round game $ g$ where the questions $ ( x , y ) \in \mathcal{x}\times\mathcal{y}$ to alice and bob are drawn from a product distribution on $ \mathcal{x}\times\mathcal{y}$. we show that for the $ k$-fold product $ g^k$ of the game $ g$ ( which represents the game $ g$ played in parallel $ k$ times independently ) , $ \omega^*(g^k ) = \left(1-(1-\omega^*(g))^3\right)^{\omega\left(\frac{k}{\log(|\mathcal{a}| \cdot |\mathcal{b}|)}\right ) } $ , where $ \mathcal{a}$ and $ \mathcal{b}$ represent the sets from which the answers of alice and bob are drawn .
