quantum error correction of a surface code or repetition code requires the pairwise matching of error events in a space - time graph of qubit measurements , such that the total weight of the matching is minimized . the input weights follow from a physical model of the error processes that affect the qubits . this approach becomes problematic if the system has sources of error that change over time . here we show how the weights can be determined from the measured data in the absence of an error model . the resulting adaptive decoder performs well in a time - dependent environment , provided that the characteristic time scale $ \tau_{\mathrm{env}}$ of the variations is greater than $ \delta t/\bar{p}$ , with $ \delta t$ the duration of one error - correction cycle and $ \bar{p}$ the typical error probability per qubit in one cycle .
