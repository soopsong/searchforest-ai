we characterize a novel josephson parametric amplifier based on a flux - tunable quarter - wavelength resonator . the fundamental resonance frequency is ~1ghz , but we use higher modes of the resonator for our measurements . an on - chip tuning line allows for magnetic flux pumping of the amplifier . we investigate and compare degenerate parametric amplification , involving a single mode , and nondegenerate parametric amplification , using a pair of modes . we show that we reach quantum - limited noise performance in both cases , and we show that the added noise can be less than 0.5 added photons in the case of low gain .
