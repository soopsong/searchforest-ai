hyperentanglement is a promising resource in quantum information processing , especially for increasing the channel capacity of long - distance quantum communication . hyperentanglement purification is an important method to obtain high - fidelity nonlocal hyperentangled states from mixed hyperentangled states in a long - distance quantum communication process with noisy channels . here , we present a two - step hyperentanglement purification protocol for nonlocal mixed hyperentangled states with polarization bit - flip errors and spatial - mode phase - flip errors , resorting to polarization - spatial phase - check quantum nondemolition detectors and the quantum - state - joining method ( qsjm ) . with qsjm , the protocol can preserve the states that are discarded in the previous hyperentanglement purification protocols . it has the advantage of a high efficiency , and it is useful for improving the entanglement of photon systems with several degrees of freedom in long - distance high - capacity quantum communication .
