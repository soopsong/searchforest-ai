we demonstrate how to use lattice surgery to enact a universal set of fault - tolerant quantum operations with color codes . along the way , we also improve existing surface - code lattice - surgery methods . lattice - surgery methods use fewer qubits and the same time or less than associated defect - braiding methods . furthermore , per code distance , color - code lattice surgery uses approximately half the qubits and the same time or less than surface - code lattice surgery . color - code lattice surgery can also implement the hadamard and phase gates in a single transversal step --- much faster than surface - code lattice surgery can . against uncorrelated circuit - level depolarizing noise , color - code lattice surgery uses fewer qubits to achieve the same degree of fault - tolerant error suppression as surface - code lattice surgery when the noise rate is low enough and the error suppression demand is high enough .
