we show how to apply lyapunov control design to the problem of entanglement creation between two atoms in distant cavities connected by optical fibers . the lyapunov control design is optimal in the sense that the distance from the target state decreases monotonically and exponentially , and the concurrence increases accordingly . this method is far more robust than simple geometric schemes .
