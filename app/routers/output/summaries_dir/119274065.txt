it is generally difficult to study the dynamical properties of a quantum system with both inherent quantum noises and non - perturbative nonlinearity . due to the possibly drastic intensity increase of an input coherent light in the gain - loss waveguide couplers with parity - time ( pt ) symmetry , the kerr effect from a nonlinearity added into the systems can be greatly enhanced , and is expected to create the macroscopic entangled states of the output light fields with huge photon numbers . meanwhile , the quantum noises also coexist with the amplification and dissipation of the light fields . under the interplay between the quantum noises and nonlinearity , the quantum dynamical behaviors of the systems become rather complicated . however , the important quantum noise effects have been mostly neglected in the previous studies about nonlinear pt - symmetric systems . here we present a solution to this non - perturbative quantum nonlinear problem , showing the real - time evolution of the system observables . the enhanced kerr nonlinearity is found to give rise to a previously unknown decoherence effect that is irrelevant to the quantum noises , and imposes a limit on the emergence of macroscopic nonclassicality . in contrast to what happen in the linear systems , the quantum noises exert significant impact on the system dynamics , and can create the nonclassical light field states in conjunction with the enhanced kerr nonlinearity . this first study on the noise involved quantum nonlinear dynamics of the coupled gain - loss waveguides can help to better understand the quantum noise effects in the broad nonlinear systems .
