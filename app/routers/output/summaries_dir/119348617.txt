a quantum telecloning process combining quantum teleportation and optimal quantum cloning from one input to m outputs is presented . the scheme relies on the establishment of particular multiparticle entangled states , which function as multiuser quantum information channels . the entanglement structure of these states is analyzed and shown to be crucial for this type of information processing .
