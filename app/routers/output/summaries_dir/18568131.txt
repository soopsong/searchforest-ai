we characterise the probability distributions that arise from quantum circuits all of whose gates commute , and show when these distributions can be classically simulated efficiently . we consider also marginal distributions and the computation of correlation coefficients , and draw connections between the simulation of stabiliser circuits and the combinatorics of representable matroids , as developed in the 1990s .
