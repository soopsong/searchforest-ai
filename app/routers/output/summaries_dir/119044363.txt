we present an analysis of the dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a superconducting single electron transistor ( sset ) in the vicinity of the josephson quasiparticle ( jqp ) and double josephson quasiparticle ( djqp ) resonances . for weak coupling and wide separation of dynamical timescales , we find that for either superconducting resonance the dynamics of the resonator is given by a fokker - planck equation , i.e. , the sset behaves effectively as an equilibrium heat bath , characterised by an effective temperature , which also damps the resonator and renormalizes its frequency . depending on the gate and drain - source voltage bias points with respect to the superconducting resonance , the sset can also give rise to an instability in the mechanical resonator marked by negative damping and temperature within the appropriate fokker - planck equation . furthermore , sufficiently close to a resonance , we find that the fokker - planck description breaks down . we also point out that there is a close analogy between coupling a nanomechanical resonator to a sset in the vicinity of the jqp resonance and doppler cooling of atoms by means of lasers .
