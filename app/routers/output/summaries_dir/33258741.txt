we present a procedure for reproducibly fabricating ultrahigh transmission optical nanofibers ( 530 nm diameter and 84 mm stretch ) with single - mode transmissions of 99.95 $ \pm$ 0.02 % , which represents a loss from tapering of 2.6 $ \,\times \,$ 10$^{-5}$ db / mm when normalized to the entire stretch . when controllably launching the next family of higher - order modes on a fiber with 195 mm stretch , we achieve a transmission of 97.8 $ \pm$ 2.8 % , which has a loss from tapering of 5.0 $ \,\times \,$ 10$^{-4}$ db / mm when normalized to the entire stretch . our pulling and transfer procedures allow us to fabricate optical nanofibers that transmit more than 400 mw in high vacuum conditions . these results , published as parameters in our previous work , present an improvement of two orders of magnitude less loss for the fundamental mode and an increase in transmission of more than 300 % for higher - order modes , when following the protocols detailed in this paper . we extract from the transmission during the pull , the only reported spectrogram of a fundamental mode launch that does not include excitation to asymmetric modes ; in stark contrast to a pull in which our cleaning protocol is not followed . these results depend critically on the pre - pull cleanliness and when properly following our pulling protocols are in excellent agreement with simulations .
