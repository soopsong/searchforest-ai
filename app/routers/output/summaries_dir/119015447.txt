we extend the definition of concurrence into a family of entanglement monotones , which we call concurrence monotones . we discuss their properties and advantages as computational manageable measures of entanglement , and show that for pure bipartite states all measures of entanglement can be written as functions of the concurrence monotones . we then show that the concurrence monotones provide bounds on quantum information tasks . as an example , we discuss their applications to remote entanglement distributions ( red ) such as entanglement swapping and remote preparation of bipartite entangled states ( rpbes ) . we prove a powerful theorem which states what kind of ( possibly mixed ) bipartite states or distributions of bipartite states can not be remotely prepared . the theorem establishes an upper bound on the amount of $ g$-concurrence ( one member in the concurrence family ) that can be created between two single - qudit nodes of quantum networks by means of tripartite red . for pure bipartite states the bound on the $ g$-concurrence can always be saturated by rpbes .
