a proposal for a magnetic quantum processor that consists of individual molecular spins coupled to superconducting coplanar resonators and transmission lines is carefully examined . we derive a simple magnetic quantum electrodynamics hamiltonian to describe the underlying physics . it is shown that these hybrid devices can perform arbitrary operations on each spin qubit and induce tunable interactions between any pair of them . the combination of these two operations ensures that the processor can perform universal quantum computations . the feasibility of this proposal is critically discussed using the results of realistic calculations , based on parameters of existing devices and molecular qubits . these results show that the proposal is feasible , provided that molecules with sufficiently long coherence times can be developed and accurately integrated into specific areas of the device . this architecture has an enormous potential for scaling up quantum computation thanks to the microscopic nature of the individual constituents , the molecules , and the possibility of using their internal spin degrees of freedom .
