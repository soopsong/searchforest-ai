we describe an experimentally feasible protocol for performing a variant of the quantum delayed - choice experiment with massive objects . in this scheme , a single nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center in diamond driven by microwave fields is dispersively coupled to a massive mechanical resonator . a double - pulse ramsey interferometer can be implemented with the spin - mechanical setup , where the second ramsey microwave pulse drives the spin conditioned on the number states of the resonator . the probability for finding the nv center in definite spin states exhibits interference fringes when the mechanical resonator is prepared in a specific number state . on the other hand , the interference is destroyed if the mechanical resonator stays in some other number states . the wavelike and particlelike behavior of the nv spin can be superposed by preparing the mechanical resonator in a superposition of two distinct number states . thus a quantum version of wheeler 's delayed - choice experiment could be implemented , allowing of fundamental tests of quantum mechanics on a macroscopic scale .
