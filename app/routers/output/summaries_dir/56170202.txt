we investigate monogamy relations related to quantum entanglement for $ n-$qubit quantum systems . general monogamy inequalities are presented to the $ \beta$th $ ( \beta\in(0,2))$ power of concurrence , negativity and the convex - roof extended negativity , as well as the $ \beta$th $ ( \beta\in(0,\sqrt{2}))$ power of entanglement of formation . these monogamy relations are complementary to the existing ones with different regions of parameter $ \beta$. in additions , new monogamy relations are also derived which include the existing ones as special cases .
