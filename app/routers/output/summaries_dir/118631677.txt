we derive an analytical description for the quantum state preparation using systems of on - off detectors . our method will apply the true click statistics of such detector systems . in particular , we consider heralded quantum state preparation using correlated light fields , photon addition and photon subtraction processes . using a post - selection procedure to a particular number of clicks of the detector system , the output states reveal a variety of quantum features . the rigorous description allows the identification and characterization of fundamentally unavoidable attenuations within given processes . we also generalize a known scenario of noiseless amplification with click detectors for the purpose of the preparation of various types of nonclassical states of light . our exact results are useful for the choice of experimental parameters to realize a target state .
