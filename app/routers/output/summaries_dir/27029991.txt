we study the effects of diffusion on a $ \lambda$-gradient echo memory , which is a coherent optical quantum memory using thermal gases . the efficiency of this memory is high for short storage time , but decreases exponentially due to decoherence as the storage time is increased . we study the effects of both longitudinal and transverse diffusion in this memory system , and give both analytical and numerical results that are in good agreement . our results show that diffusion has a significant effect on the efficiency . further , we suggest ways to reduce these effects to improve storage efficiency .
