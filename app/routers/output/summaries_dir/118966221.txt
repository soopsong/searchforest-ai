we introduce a new quantum key distribution protocol that uses d - level quantum systems to encode an alphabet with c letters . it has the property that the error rate introduced by an intercept - and - resend attack tends to one as the numbers c and d increase . in dimension d=2 , when the legitimate parties use a complete set of three mutually unbiased bases , the protocol achieves a quantum bit error rate of 57.1 % . this represents a significant improvement over the 25 % quantum bit error rate achieved in the bb84 protocol or 33 % in the six - state protocol .
