using the coherent state functional integral expression of the partition function , we show that the sine - gordon model on an analogue curved spacetime arises as the effective quantum field theory for phase fluctuations of a weakly imperfect bose gas on an incompressible background superfluid flow when these fluctuations are restricted to a subspace of the single - particle hilbert space . we consider bipartitions of the single - particle hilbert space relevant to experiments on ultracold bosonic atomic or molecular gases , including , e.g. , restriction to high- or low - energy sectors of the dynamics and spatial bipartition corresponding to tunnel - coupled planar bose gases . by assuming full unitary quantum control in the low - energy subspace of a trapped gas , we show that ( 1 ) appropriately tuning the particle number statistics of the lowest - energy mode partially decouples the low- and high - energy sectors , allowing any low - energy single - particle wave function to define a background for sine - gordon dynamics on curved spacetime and ( 2 ) macroscopic occupation of a quantum superposition of two states of the lowest two modes produces an analogue curved spacetime depending on two background flows , with respective weights continuously dependent on the corresponding weights of the superposed quantum states .
