refrigerators soak up heat energy from a low - temperature region and dump it into a higher temperature region using external work done on the system . refrigerators are useful in cooling down a system to very low temperatures . in this letter , we show that a monolayer of strained graphene can be used in designing a quantum refrigerator with an excellent coefficient of performance and large cooling power . the operating point at which the strained graphene device works best as a quantum refrigerator is derived and the effects of strain and temperature on cooling are discussed .
