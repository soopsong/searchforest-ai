we address local quantum estimation of bilinear hamiltonians probed by gaussian states . we evaluate the relevant quantum fisher information ( qfi ) and derive the ultimate bound on precision . upon maximizing the qfi we found that single- and two - mode squeezed vacuum represent an optimal and universal class of probe states , achieving the so - called heisenberg limit to precision in terms of the overall energy of the probe . we explicitly obtain the optimal observable based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative and also found that homodyne detection assisted by bayesian analysis may achieve estimation of squeezing with near - optimal sensitivity in any working regime . besides , by comparison of our results with those coming from global optimization of the measurement we found that gaussian states are effective resources , which allow to achieve the ultimate bound on precision imposed by quantum mechanics using measurement schemes feasible with current technology .
