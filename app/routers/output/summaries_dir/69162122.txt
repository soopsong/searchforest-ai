we present a new optical scheme enabling the implementation of highly stable and configurable non - markovian dynamics . here one photon qubit can circulate in a multipass bulk geometry consisting of two concatenated sagnac interferometers to simulate the so called collisional model , where the system interacts at discrete times with a vacuum environment . we show the optical features of our apparatus and three different implementations of it , replicating a pure markovian scenario and two non - markovian ones , where we quantify the information backflow by tracking the evolution of the initial entanglement between the system photon and an ancillary one .
