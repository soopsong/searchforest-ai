we benchmark a selection of semiclassical and perturbative dynamics techniques by investigating the correlated evolution of a cavity - bound atomic system to assess their applicability to study problems involving strong light - matter interactions in quantum cavities . the model system of interest features spontaneous emission , interference , and strong coupling behaviour , and necessitates the consideration of vacuum fluctuations and correlated light - matter dynamics . we compare a selection of approximate dynamics approaches including fewest switches surface hopping , multi - trajectory ehrenfest dynamics , linearized semiclasical dynamics , and partially linearized semiclassical dynamics . furthermore , investigating self - consistent perturbative methods , we apply the bogoliubov - born - green - kirkwood - yvon hierarchy in the second born approximation . with the exception of fewest switches surface hopping , all methods provide a reasonable level of accuracy for the correlated light - matter dynamics , with most methods lacking the capacity to fully capture interference effects .
