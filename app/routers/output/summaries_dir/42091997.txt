in most theoretical descriptions of collective strong coupling of organic molecules to a cavity mode , the molecules are modeled as simple two - level systems . this picture fails to describe the rich structure provided by their internal rovibrational ( nuclear ) degrees of freedom . we investigate a first - principles model that fully takes into account both electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom , allowing an exploration of the phenomenon of strong coupling from an entirely new perspective . first , we demonstrate the limitations of applicability of the born - oppenheimer approximation in strongly coupled molecule - cavity structures . for the case of two molecules , we also show how dark states , which within the two - level picture are effectively decoupled from the cavity , are indeed affected by the formation of collective strong coupling . finally , we discuss ground - state modifications in the ultra - strong coupling regime and show that some molecular observables are affected by the collective coupling strength , while others only depend on the single - molecule coupling constant .
