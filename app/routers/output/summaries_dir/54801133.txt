we use the theory of quantum estimation in two different qubit - boson coupling models to demonstrate that the temperature of a quantum harmonic oscillator can be estimated with high precision by quantum - limited measurements on the qubit . the two models that we address embody situations of current physical interest due to their connection with ongoing experimental efforts on the control of mesoscopic dynamics . we show that population measurements performed over the qubit probe are near optimal for a broad range of temperatures of the harmonic oscillator
