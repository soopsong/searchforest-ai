the development of scalable sources of non - classical light is fundamental to unlock the technological potential of quantum photonics\cite{kimble : nat2008 } . among the systems under investigation , semiconductor quantum dots are currently emerging as near - optimal sources of indistinguishable single photons . however , their performances as sources of entangled - photon pairs are in comparison still modest . experiments on conventional stranski - krastanow ingaas quantum dots have reported non - optimal levels of entanglement and indistinguishability of the emitted photons . for applications such as entanglement teleportation and quantum repeaters , both criteria have to be met simultaneously . in this work , we show that this is possible focusing on a system that has received limited attention so far : gaas quantum dots grown via droplet etching . using a two - photon resonant excitation scheme , we demonstrate that these quantum dots can emit triggered polarization - entangled photons with high purity ( g^(2)(0)=0.002 + /-0.002 ) , high indistinguishability ( 0.93 + /-0.07 ) and high entanglement fidelity ( 0.94 + /-0.01 ) . such unprecedented degree of entanglement , which in contrast to ingaas can theoretically reach near - unity values , allows bell 's inequality ( 2.64 + /-0.01 ) to be violated without the aid of temporal or spectral filtering . our results show that if quantum - dot entanglement resources are to be used for future quantum technologies , gaas might be the system of choice .
