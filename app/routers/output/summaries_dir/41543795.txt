we study the convex set of all bipartite quantum states with fixed marginal states . the extremal states in this set have recently been characterized by parthasarathy [ ann . henri poincar\'e ( to appear ) , quant - ph/0307182 , [ 1 ] ] . here we present an alternative necessary and sufficient condition for a state with given marginals to be extremal . our approach is based on a canonical duality between bipartite states and a certain class of completely positive maps and has the advantage that it is easier to check and to construct explicit examples of extremal states . in dimension 2 x 2 we give a simple new proof for the fact that all extremal states with maximally mixed marginals are precisely the projectors onto maximally entangled wave functions . we also prove that in higher dimension this does not hold and construct an explicit example of an extremal state with maximally mixed marginals in dimension 3 x 3 that is not maximally entangled . generalizations of this result to higher dimensions are also discussed .
