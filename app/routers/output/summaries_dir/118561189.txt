we study analytically the time - dependent boundary conditions of superconducting microwave circuit experiments in the high plasma frequency limit , in which the conditions are robin - type and relate the value of the field to the spatial derivative of the field . we give an explicit solution to the field evolution for boundary condition modulations that are small in magnitude but may have arbitrary time dependence , in a formalism that applies both to a semiopen waveguide and to a closed waveguide with two independently adjustable boundaries . the correspondence between the microwave robin boundary conditions and the mechanically - moving dirichlet boundary conditions of the dynamical casimir effect is shown to break down at high field frequencies , approximately one order of magnitude above the frequencies probed in the 2011 experiment of wilson et al . our results bound the parameter regime in which a microwave circuit can be used to model relativistic effects in a mechanically - moving cavity , and they show that beyond this parameter regime moving mirrors produce more particles and generate more entanglement than their non - moving microwave waveguide simulations .
