cluster states with higher - dimensional lattices that can not be physically embedded in three - dimensional space have important theoretical interest in quantum computation and quantum simulation of topologically ordered condensed - matter systems . we present a simple , scalable , top - down method of entangling the quantum optical frequency comb into hypercubic - lattice continuous - variable cluster states of a size of about 10 ^ 4 quantum field modes , using existing technology . a hypercubic lattice of dimension d ( linear , square , cubic , hypercubic , etc . ) requires but d optical parametric oscillators with bichromatic pumps whose frequency splittings alone determine the lattice dimensionality and the number of copies of the state .
