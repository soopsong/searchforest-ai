recently , it has been shown that the massless quantum vacuum state contains entanglement between timelike separated regions of spacetime , in addition to the entanglement between the spacelike separated regions usually considered . here , we show that timelike entanglement can be extracted from the minkowski vacuum and converted into ordinary entanglement between two inertial , two - state detectors at the same spatial location -- one coupled to the field in the past and the other coupled to the field in the future . the procedure used here demonstrates a clear time correlation as a requirement for extraction , e.g. if the past detector was active at a quarter to 12:00 , then the future detector must wait to become active at precisely a quarter past 12:00 in order to achieve entanglement .
