recently , it has been shown that the quantum fisher information via local observables and via local measurements ( i.e. , local quantum fisher information ( lqfi ) ) is a central concept in quantum estimation and quantum metrology and captures the quantumness of correlations in the multi - component quantum system [ s. kim et al . , phys . rev . a. 97 , 032326 ( 2018 ) ] . this new discord - like measure is very similar to the quantum correlations measure called local quantum uncertainty ( lqu ) . in the present study , we have revealed that lqu is bounded by lqfi in the phase estimation protocol . also , a comparative study between these two quantum correlations quantifiers is addressed for the quantum heisenberg $ xy$ model . two distinct situations are considered . the first one concerns the anisotropic $ xy$ model and the second situation concerns the isotropic $ xy$ model submitted to an external magnetic field . our results confirm that lqfi reveals more quantum correlations than lqu .
