at the quantum level , feedback - loops have to take into account measurement back - action . we present here the structure of the markovian models including such back - action and sketch two stabilization methods : measurement - based feedback where an open quantum system is stabilized by a classical controller ; coherent or autonomous feedback where a quantum system is stabilized by a quantum controller with decoherence ( reservoir engineering ) . we begin to explain these models and methods for the photon box experiments realized in the group of serge haroche ( nobel prize 2012 ) . we present then these models and methods for general open quantum systems .
