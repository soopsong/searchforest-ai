we analyze the design of a potential replacement technology for the commercial ferrite circulators that are ubiquitous in contemporary quantum superconducting microwave experiments . the lossless , lumped element design is capable of being integrated on chip with other superconducting microwave devices , thus circumventing the many performance - limiting aspects of ferrite circulators . the design is based on the dynamic modulation of dc superconducting microwave quantum interference devices ( squids ) that function as nearly linear , tunable inductors . the connection to familiar ferrite - based circulators is a simple frame boost in the internal dynamics ' equation of motion . in addition to the general , schematic analysis , we also give an overview of many considerations necessary to achieve a practical design with a tunable center frequency in the 4 - 8 ghz frequency band , a bandwidth of 240 mhz , reflections at the -20 db level , and a maximum signal power of approximately order 100 microwave photons per inverse bandwidth .
