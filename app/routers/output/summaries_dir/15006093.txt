we introduce a family of quantum walks on cycles parametrized by their liveliness , defined by the ability to execute a long - range move . we investigate the behaviour of the probability distribution and time - averaged probability distribution . we show that the liveliness parameter , controlling the magnitude of the additional long - range move , has a direct impact on the periodicity of the limiting distribution . we also show that the introduced model provides a method for network exploration which is robust against trapping .
