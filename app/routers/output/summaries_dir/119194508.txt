transporting quantum information is an important prerequisite for quantum computers . we study how this can be done in heisenberg - coupled spin networks using adiabatic control over the coupling strengths . we find that qudits can be transferred and entangled pairs can be created between distant sites of bipartite graphs with a certain balance between the maximum spin of both parts , extending previous results that were limited to linear chains . the transfer fidelity in a small star - shaped network is numerically analysed , and possible experimental implementations are discussed .
