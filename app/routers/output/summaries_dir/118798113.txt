we investigate possibility of central extension for non - relativistic conformal algebras in 1 + 1 dimension . three different forms of charges can be suggested . a trivial charge for temporal part of the algebra exists for all elements of l - galilei algebra class . in attempt to find a central extension as of cga for other elements of the l - galilei class , possibility for such extension was excluded . for integer and half integer elements of the class we can have an infinite extension of the generalized mass charge for the virasoro - like extended algebra . for finite algebras a regular charge inspired by schr\"odinger central extension is possible .
