the emergence of coherent rotating structures is a phenomenon characteristic of both classical and quantum 2d turbulence . in this work we show theoretically that the coherent vortex structures that emerge in decaying 2d quantum turbulence can approach quasi - classical rigid - body rotation , obeying the feynman rule of constant average areal vortex density while remaining spatially disordered . by developing a rigorous link between the velocity probability distribution and the quantum kinetic energy spectrum over wavenumber $ k$ , we show that the coherent vortex structures are associated with a $ k^3 $ power law in the infrared region of the spectrum , and a well - defined spectral peak that is a physical manifestation of the largest structures . we discuss the possibility of realizing coherent structures in bose -- einstein condensate experiments and present gross - pitaevskii simulations showing that this phenomenon , and its associated spectral signatures , can emerge dynamically from feasible initial vortex configurations .
