we study the connection between the hilbert - schmidt measure of entanglement ( that is the minimal distance of an entangled state to the set of separable states ) and entanglement witness in terms of a generalized bell inequality which distinguishes between entangled and separable states . a method for checking the nearest separable state to a given entangled one is presented . we illustrate the general results by considering isotropic states , in particular 2-qubit and 2-qutrit states -- and their generalizations to arbitrary dimensions -- where we calculate the optimal entanglement witnesses explicitly .
