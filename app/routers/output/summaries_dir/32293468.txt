recent experimental observations of time - dependent beatings in the two - dimensional echo - spectra of light - harvesting complexes at ambient temperatures have opened up the question whether coherence and wave - like behaviour plays a significant role in photosynthesis . we perform a numerical study of the absorption and echo - spectra of the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex in chlorobium tepidum and analyse the requirements in the theoretical model needed to reproduce beatings in the calculated spectra . the energy transfer in the fmo pigment - protein complex is theoretically described by an exciton hamiltonian coupled to a phonon bath which account for the pigments electronic and vibrational excitations respectively . we use the hierarchical equations of motions method to treat the strong couplings in a non - perturbative way . we show that the oscillations in the two - dimensional echo - spectra persist in the presence of thermal noise and static disorder .
