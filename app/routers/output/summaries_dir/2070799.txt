feedback control ( based on the quantum continuous measurement ) of quantum systems inevitably suffers from estimation delays . in this paper we give a delay - dependent stability criterion for a wide class of nonlinear stochastic systems including quantum spin systems . we utilize a semi - algebraic problem approach to incorporate the structure of density matrices . to show the effectiveness of the result , we derive a globally stabilizing control law for a quantum spin-1/2 systems in the face of feedback delays .
