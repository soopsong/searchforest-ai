we prove a regularized formula for the secret key - assisted capacity region of a quantum channel for transmitting private classical information . this result parallels the work of devetak on entanglement assisted quantum communication capacity \cite{dhw05ri } . this formula provides a new family protocol , the private father protocol , under the resource inequality framework that includes private classical communication \it{without } secret key assistance as a child protocol .
