given two hilbert spaces , $ \mathcal{h}$ and $ \mathcal{k}$ , we introduce an abstract unitary operator $ u$ on $ \mathcal{h}$ and its discriminant $ t$ on $ \mathcal{k}$ induced by a coisometry from $ \mathcal{h}$ to $ \mathcal{k}$ and a unitary involution on $ \mathcal{h}$. in a particular case , these operators $ u$ and $ t$ become the evolution operator of the szegedy walk on a graph , possibly infinite , and the transition probability operator thereon . we show the spectral mapping theorem between $ u$ and $ t$ via the joukowsky transform . using this result , we have completely detemined the spectrum of the grover walk on the sierpi\'nski lattice , which is pure point and has a cantor - like structure .
