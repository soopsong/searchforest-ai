we report the design , fabrication , and characterization of a microfabricated surface - electrode ion trap that supports controlled transport through the two - dimensional intersection of linear trapping zones arranged in a ninety - degree cross . the trap is fabricated with very - large - scalable - integration ( vlsi ) techniques which are compatible with scaling to a larger quantum information processor . the shape of the radio - frequency ( rf ) electrodes is optimized with a genetic algorithm to minimize axial pseudopotential barriers and to minimize ion heating during transport . seventy - eight independent dc control electrodes enable fine control of the trapping potentials . we demonstrate reliable ion transport between junction legs , trapping of ion chains with nearly - equal spacing in one of the trap 's linear sections , and merging and splitting ions from these chains . doppler - cooled ions survive more than 10 ^ 5 round - trip transits between junction legs without loss and more than sixty - five consecutive round trips without laser cooling .
