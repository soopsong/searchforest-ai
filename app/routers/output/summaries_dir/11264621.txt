we provide a new efficient adaptive algorithm for performing phase estimation that does not require that the user infer the bits of the eigenphase in reverse order ; rather it directly infers the phase and estimates the uncertainty in the phase directly from experimental data . our method is highly flexible , recovers from failures , and can be run in the presence of substantial decoherence and other experimental imperfections and is as fast or faster than existing algorithms .
