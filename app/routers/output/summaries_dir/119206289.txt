we introduce a shortcut to the adiabatic gate teleportation model of quantum computation . more specifically , we determine fast local counterdiabatic hamiltonians able to implement teleportation as a universal computational primitive . in this scenario , we provide the counterdiabatic driving for arbitrary n - qubit gates , which allows to achieve universality through a variety of gate sets . remarkably , our approach maps the superadiabatic hamiltonian for an arbitrary n - qubit gate teleportation into the implementation of a rotated superadiabatic dynamics of an n - qubit state teleportation . this result is rather general , with the speed of the evolution only dictated by the quantum speed limit . in particular , we analyze the energetic cost for different hamiltonian interpolations in the context of the energy - time complementarity .
