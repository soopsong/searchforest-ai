we propose a quantum machine learning algorithm for efficiently solving a class of problems encoded in quantum controlled unitary operations . the central physical mechanism of the protocol is the iteration of a quantum time - delayed equation that introduces feedback in the dynamics and eliminates the necessity of intermediate measurements . the performance of the quantum algorithm is analyzed by comparing the results obtained in numerical simulations with the outcome of classical machine learning methods for the same problem . the use of time - delayed equations enhances the toolbox of the field of quantum machine learning , which may enable unprecedented applications in quantum technologies .
