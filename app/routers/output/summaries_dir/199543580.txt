we investigate the multi - phonon interactions in a hybrid system composed of a nitrogen - vacancy center and a mechanical resonator.we show that , through appropriate sideband engineering analogy to the mollow or lamb - dicke dynamics , the enhanced nonlinear interactions can dominate the coupled system . as an example , we show the preparation of nonclassical states of the mechanical motion and explore the quantum correlation of $ n$-phonon with the engineered dissipation , based on the large multi - phonon coupling strength attainable in this sideband structure . this work takes full advantage of the structure and coherence features of defect centers in diamond , and may be useful for quantum information processing .
