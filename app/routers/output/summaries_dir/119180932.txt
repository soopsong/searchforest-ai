heterogeneous bipartite quantum pure states , composed of two subsystems with a different number of levels , can not have both reductions maximally mixed . in this work , we demonstrate existence of a wide range of highly entangled states of heterogeneous multipartite systems consisting of $ n>2 $ parties such that every reduction to one and two parties is maximally mixed . two constructions of generating genuinely multipartite maximally entangled states of heterogeneous systems for an arbitrary number of subsystems are presented . such states are related to quantum error correction codes over mixed alphabets and mixed orthogonal arrays . additionally , we show the advantages of considering heterogeneous systems in practical implementations of multipartite steering .
