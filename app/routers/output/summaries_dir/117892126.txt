we report the direct -- continuous in phase -- sampling of a regularized $ p$ function , the so - called nonclassicality quasiprobability , for squeezed light . through their negativities , the resulting phase - space representation uncovers the quantum character of the state . in contrast to discrete phase - locked measurements , our approach allows an unconditional verification of nonclassicality by getting rid of interpolation errors due to fixed phases . to realize the equal phase distribution of measured quadratures , a data selection is implemented with quantum random numbers created by measuring the vacuum noise . the continuously measured squeezed field was generated in an optical parametric amplifier . suitable pattern functions for obtaining the regularized $ p$ function are investigated . the significance of detecting negativities in our application is determined . the sampling of nonclassicality quasiprobabilities is shown to be a powerful and universal method to visualize quantum effects within arbitrary quantum states .
