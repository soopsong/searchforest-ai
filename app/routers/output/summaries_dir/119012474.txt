we consider the problem of correcting the errors incurred from sending classical or quantum information through a noisy quantum environment by schemes using classical information obtained from a measurement on the environment . we give a conditions for quantum or classical information ( prepared in a specified input basis b ) to be corrigible based on a measurement m. based on these criteria we give examples of noisy channels such that ( 1 ) no information can be corrected by such a scheme ( 2 ) for some basis b there is a correcting measurement m ( 3 ) for all bases b there is an m ( 4 ) there is a measurement m which allows perfect correction for all bases b. the last case is equivalent to the possibility of correcting quantum information , and turns out to be equivalent to the channel allowing a representation as a convex combination of isometric channels . such channels are doubly stochastic but not conversely .
