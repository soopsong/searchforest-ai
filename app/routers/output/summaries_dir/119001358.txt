the reconstruction of charged particles will be a key computing challenge for the high - luminosity large hadron collider ( hl - lhc ) where increased data rates lead to large increases in running time for current pattern recognition algorithms . an alternative approach explored here expresses pattern recognition as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization ( qubo ) using software and quantum annealing . at track densities comparable with current lhc conditions , our approach achieves physics performance competitive with state - of - the - art pattern recognition algorithms . more research will be needed to achieve comparable performance in hl - lhc conditions , as increasing track density decreases the purity of the qubo track segment classifier .
