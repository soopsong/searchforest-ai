we consider an atomic beam reservoir as a source of quantum noise . the atoms are modelled as two - state systems and interact one - at - a - time with the system . the floquet operators are described in terms of the fermionic creation , annihilation and number operators associated with the two - state atom . in the limit where the time between interactions goes to zero and the interaction is suitably scaled , we show that we may obtain a causal ( that is , adapted ) quantum stochastic differential equation of hudson - parthasarathy type , driven by creation , annihilation and conservation processes . the effect of the floquet operators in the continuous limit is exactly captured by the holevo ordered form for the stochastic evolution .
