we give a complete solution for the three - tangle of mixed three - qubit states composed of a generalized ghz state , a|000>+b|111 > , and a generalized w state , c|001>+d|010>+f|100 > . using the methods introduced by lohmayer et al . we provide explicit expressions for the mixed - state three - tangle and the corresponding optimal decompositions for this more general case . moreover , as a special case we obtain a general solution for a family of states consisting of a generalized ghz state and an orthogonal product state .
