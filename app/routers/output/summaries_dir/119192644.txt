we study the evolution of higher - order nonclassicality and entanglement criteria in atmospheric fluctuating - loss channels . by formulating input - output relations for the matrix of moments , we investigate the influence of such channels on the corresponding quantumness criteria . this generalization of our previous work on gaussian entanglement [ m. bohmann et al . , phys . rev . a 94 , 010302(r ) ( 2016 ) ] not only exploits second - order - based scenarios , but it also provides a detailed investigation of nonclassicality and entanglement in non - gaussian and multimode radiation fields undergoing a fluctuating attenuation . that is , various examples of criteria and states are studied in detail , unexpected effects , e.g. , the dependency of the squeezing transfer on the coherent displacement , are discovered , and it is demonstrated that non - gaussian entanglement can be more robust against atmospheric losses than gaussian one . additionally , we propose a detection scheme for measuring the considered moments after propagation through the atmosphere . therefore , our results may help to develop , improve , and optimize non - gaussian sources of quantum light for applications in free - space quantum communication .
