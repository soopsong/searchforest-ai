the theory of open quantum system is one of the most important tools for the development of quantum technologies . furthermore , the lindblad ( or gorini- kossakowski - sudarshan - lindblad ) master equation plays a key role as it is the most general generator of markovian dynamics in quantum systems . in this paper , we present this equation together with its derivation and methods of resolution . the presentation tries to be as self - contained and simple as possible to be useful to readers with no previous knowledge of this field .
