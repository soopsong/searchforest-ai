we discuss the concept of characteristic squeezing modes applied to a travelling - wave optical parametric amplifier pumped by an ultrashort pulse . the characteristic modes undergo decoupled single - mode squeezing transformations , and therefore they form a useful basis to describe the evolution of the entire multimode system . this provides an elegant and intuitive picture of quantum statistical properties of parametric fluorescence . we analyse the efficiency of detecting quadrature squeezing , and present results of numerical calculations for a realistic nonlinear medium .
