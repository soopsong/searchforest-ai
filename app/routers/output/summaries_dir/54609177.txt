quantum random walk finds application in efficient quantum algorithms as well as in quantum network theory . here we study the mixing time of a discrete quantum walk over a square lattice in presence percolation and decoherence . we consider bit - flip and phase damping noise , and evaluate the instantaneous mixing time for both the cases . using numerical analysis we show that in case of phase damping noise probability distribution of walker 's position is sufficiently close to the uniform distribution after infinite time . however , during the action of bit - flip noise , even after infinite time the total variation distance between the two probability distributions is large enough .
