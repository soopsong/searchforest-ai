in this paper , the non - markovian quantum dynamics of a coupled $ n$-cavity model is studied based on the quantum state diffusion ( qsd ) approach . the time - local di\'{o}si - gisin - strunz equation and the corresponding exact master equation are derived for the model consisting of a coupled cavity array . the resulting qsd equation serves as a stochastic solution to a genuine $ n$-partite continuous - variable ( cv ) system . several non - markovian effects are studied in two interesting examples -- two - cavity and three - cavity , under different boundary conditions . we have shown that the environment - memory can facilitate the cat - like state transfer from one cavity to another in the case of a strongly non - markovian environment .
