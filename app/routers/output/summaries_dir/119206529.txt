we study effects of phase fluctuations on phase sensitivity and visibility of a class of robust path - entangled photon fock states ( known as mm ' states ) as compared to the maximally path - entangled n00n states in presence of realistic phase fluctuations such as turbulence noise . our results demonstrate that the mm ' states , which are more robust than the n00n state against photon loss , perform equally well when subject to such fluctuations . we show that the phase sensitivity with parity detection for both of the above states saturates the quantum cramer - rao bound in presence of such noise , suggesting that the parity detection presents an optimal detection strategy .
