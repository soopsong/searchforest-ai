in this letter , it is proposed that cryogenic quantum bits can operate based on the nonlinearity due to the quantum capacitance of two - dimensional dirac materials , and in particular graphene . the anharmonicity of a typical superconducting quantum bit is calculated , and the sensitivity of quantum bit frequency and anharmonicity with respect to temperature are found . reasonable estimates reveal that a careful fabrication process can reveal expected properties , putting the context of quantum computing hardware into new perspectives .
