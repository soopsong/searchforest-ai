constructing an ontology for quantum theory is challenging , in part due to unavoidable measurement back - action . the aharonov - albert - vaidman weak measurement formalism provides a method to predict measurement results ( weak values ) in a regime where back - action is negligible . the weak value appears analogous to a classical conditional mean and in fact has a number of features that further suggest it may be interpreted as being related to the ontological elements of the theory . however , the ontology appears bizarre since the weak values are complex and unbounded . here , we study weak values in the context of a recent quantum optical experiment . the results of the experiment are reinterpreted within a ' neoclassical ' model of light . the model is based on standard ( maxwell ) electromagnetic theory , supplemented by stochastic fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields . we show that the conditional means of the electric field intensities correspond to the experimentally observed weak values . this is a provocative result as it suggests that at least within this experiment , the weak values could be given ontological status . while the model is shown to break down outside the experimentally probed regime , it offers an interesting conceptual starting point for a more general treatment of weak values as a fundamental property of quantum systems with a fixed past and future .
