that quantum correlations can be generated over time between the spin and the position of a quantum walker is indisputable . the creation of bipartite entanglement has also been reported for two - walker systems . in this scenario , however , since the global state lies in a fourpartite hilbert space , the question arises as to whether genuine multipartite entanglement may develop in time . also , since the spatial degrees of freedom can be viewed as a noisy channel for the two - spin part , one may wonder how other nonclassical aspects ( quantumnesses ) , such as bell nonlocality , einstein - podolsky - rosen steering , quantum discord , and symmetrical quantum discord , evolve in time during the walk . the scarcity of such a broader investigation is possibly due to computational difficulties associated with the recursive nature of quantum walks . here , we work around this issue by introducing a simplified gaussian model which proves to be very accurate within a given domain and powerful for the analytical studies . then , for an instance involving two noninteracting quantum walkers , whose spins start in the singlet state , we quantify the aforementioned quantumnesses as a function of time , and evaluate violations of both realism and related aspects of locality . in addition , we analyze situations in which the initial two - spin state is affected by white noise . the typical scenario found is such that while genuine fourpatite entanglement increases over time , all the investigated quantumnesses vanish ( suddenly or asymptotically ) except realism - based nonlocality . moreover , realism is prevented for all finite times .
