we report the fabrication and characterization of photonic structures using tapered optical nanofibers . thanks to the extension of the evanescent electromagnetic field outside of the nanofiber two types of devices can be built : a ring interferometer and a knot resonator . we propose a general approach to predict the properties of these structures using the linear coupling theory . in addition , we describe a new source of birefringence due to the ovalization of a nanofiber under strong bending , known in mechanical engineering as the brazier effect .
