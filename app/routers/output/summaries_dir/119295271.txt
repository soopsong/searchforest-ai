in this paper we study the generation of photon pairs through the process of spontaneous four wave mixing ( sfwm ) in a $ \chi^{(3)}$ cavity . our key interest is the generation of photon pairs in a guided - wave configuration - fiber or waveguide - where at least one of the photons in a given pair is matched in frequency and bandwidth to a particular atomic transition , as required for the implementation of photon - atom interfaces . we present expressions , along with plots , for the two - photon joint intensity both in the spectral and temporal domains . we also present expressions for the absolute brightness , along with numerical simulations , and show that the presence of the cavity can result in a flux enhancement relative to an equivalent source without a cavity .
