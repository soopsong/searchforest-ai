we study the holographic duality between the reflected entropy and the entanglement wedge cross section with the first order correction . in the field theory side , we consider the reflected entropy for $ \rho_{ab}^m$ , where $ \rho_{ab}$ is the reduced density matrix for two intervals in the ground state . the reflected entropy in the 2d holographic conformal field theories is computed perturbatively up to the first order in $ m-1 $ by using the semiclassical conformal block . in the gravity side , we compute the entanglement wedge cross section in the backreacted geometry by cosmic branes with tension $ t_m$ which are anchored at the ads boundary . comparing both results we find a perfect agreement , showing the duality works with the first order correction in $ m-1$.
