the interaction between light and acoustic phonons is strongly modified in sub - wavelength confinement , and has led to the demonstration and control of brillouin scattering in photonic structures such as nano - scale optical waveguides and cavities . besides the small optical mode volume , two physical mechanisms come into play simultaneously : a volume effect caused by the strain induced refractive index perturbation ( known as photo - elasticity ) , and a surface effect caused by the shift of the optical boundaries due to mechanical vibrations . as a result proper material and structure engineering allows one to control each contribution individually . in this paper , we experimentally demonstrate the perfect cancellation of brillouin scattering by engineering a silica nanowire with exactly opposing photo - elastic and moving - boundary effects . this demonstration provides clear experimental evidence that the interplay between the two mechanisms is a promising tool to precisely control the photon - phonon interaction , enhancing or suppressing it .
