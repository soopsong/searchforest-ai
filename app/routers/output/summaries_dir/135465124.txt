we use quantum detector tomography to characterize the qubit readout in terms of measurement povms on ibm quantum computers ibm q 5 tenerife and ibm q 5 yorktown . our results suggest that the characterized detector model deviates from the ideal projectors by a few percent . further improvement on this characterization can be made by adopting two- or more - qubit detector models instead of independent single - qubit detectors for all the qubits in one device . an unexpected behavior was seen in the physical qubit labelled as qubit 3 of ibm q 5 tenerife , which can be a consequence of detector crosstalk or qubit operations influencing each other and requires further investigation . this peculiar behavior is consistent with characterization from the more sophisticated approach of the gate set tomography . we also discuss how the characterized detectors ' povm , despite deviation from the ideal projectors , can be used to estimate the ideal detection distribution .
