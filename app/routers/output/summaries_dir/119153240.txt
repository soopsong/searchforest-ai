we provide a theory for quantum - optical realizations of the open dicke model with internal , atomic spin states subject to spontaneous emission with rate $ \gamma$. this introduces a second decay channel for excitations to irreversibly dissipate into the environment , in addition to the photon loss with rate $ \kappa$ , which is composed of individual atomic decay processes and a collective atomic decay mechanism . the strength of the latter is determined by the cavity geometry . we compute the mean - field non - equilibrium steady states for spin and photon observables in the long - time limit , $ t\rightarrow \infty$. although $ \gamma$ does not conserve the total angular momentum of the spin array , we argue that our solution is exact in the thermodynamic limit , for the number of atoms $ n\rightarrow \infty$. in light of recent and upcoming experiments realizing superradiant phase transitions using internal atomic states with pinned atoms in optical lattices , our work lays the foundation for the pursuit of a new class of open quantum magnets coupled to quantum light .
