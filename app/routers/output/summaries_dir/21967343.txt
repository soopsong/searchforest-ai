bloch - vector spaces for $ n$-level systems are investigated from the spherical - coordinate point of view in order to understand their geometrical aspects . we show that the maximum radius in each direction , which is due to the construction of the bloch - vector space , is determined by the minimum eigenvalue of the corresponding observable ( orthogonal generator of su(n ) ) . from this fact , we reveal the dual property of the structure of the bloch - vector space ; if in some direction the space reachs the large sphere ( pure state ) , then in the opposite direction the space can only get to the small sphere , and vice versa . another application is a parameterization with simple ranges of density operators . we also provide three classes of quantum - state representation based on actual measurements beyond the bloch vector and discuss their state - spaces .
