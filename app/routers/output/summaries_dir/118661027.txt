we compute thermal corrections to r\'enyi entropies of $ d$ dimensional conformal field theories on spheres . consider the $ n$th r\'enyi entropy for a cap of opening angle $ 2 \theta$ on $ s^{d-1}$. from a boltzmann sum decomposition and the operator - state correspondence , the leading correction is related to a certain two - point correlation function of the operator ( not equal to the identity ) with smallest scaling dimension . more specifically , via a conformal map , the correction can be expressed in terms of the two - point function on a certain conical space with opening angle $ 2\pi n$. in the case of free conformal field theories , this two - point function can be computed explicitly using the method of images . we perform the computation for the conformally coupled scalar . from the $ n \to 1 $ limit of our results , we extract the leading thermal correction to the entanglement entropy , reproducing results of arxiv:1407.1358 .
