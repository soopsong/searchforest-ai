[ abridged ] if gravitation is to be described by a hybrid metric - palatini $ f(\mathcal{r})$ gravity theory there are a number of issues that ought to be examined in its context , including the question as to whether its equations allow homogeneous g\"odel - type solutions , which necessarily leads to violation of causality . here , to look further into the potentialities and difficulties of $ f(\mathcal{r})$ theories , we examine whether they admit g\"odel - type solutions for well - motivated matter source . we first show that under certain conditions on the matter sources the problem of finding out space - time homogeneous solutions in $ f(\mathcal{r})$ theories reduces to the problem of determining solutions of einstein 's field equations with a cosmological constant . employing this far - reaching result , we determine a general g\"odel - type whose matter source is a combination of a scalar with an electromagnetic field plus a perfect fluid . this general g\"odel - type solution contains special solutions in which the essential parameter $ m^2 $ can be $ m^{2}>0 $ , $ m=0 $ , and $ m^{2}<0 $ , covering thus all classes of homogeneous g\"odel - type spacetimes . this general solution also contains all previously known solution as special cases . the bare existence of these g\"odel - type solutions makes apparent that hybrid metric - palatini gravity does not remedy causal anomaly in the form of closed timelike curves that are permitted in general relativity .
