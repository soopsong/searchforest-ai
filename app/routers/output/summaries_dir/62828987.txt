we present a new approach to scalable quantum computing -- a ` ` qubus computer''--which realises qubit measurement and quantum gates through interacting qubits with a quantum communication bus mode . the qubits could be ` ` static ' ' matter qubits or ` ` flying ' ' optical qubits , but the scheme we focus on here is particularly suited to matter qubits . there is no requirement for direct interaction between the qubits . universal two - qubit quantum gates may be effected by schemes which involve measurement of the bus mode , or by schemes where the bus disentangles automatically and no measurement is needed . in effect , the approach integrates together qubit degrees of freedom for computation with quantum continuous variables for communication and interaction .
