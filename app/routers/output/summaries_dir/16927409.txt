a quantization scheme for the phenomenological maxwell theory of the full electromagnetic field in an inhomogeneous three - dimensional , dispersive and absorbing dielectric medium is developed . the classical maxwell equations with spatially varying and kramers - kronig consistent permittivity are regarded as operator - valued field equations , introducing additional current- and charge - density operator fields in order to take into account the noise associated with the dissipation in the medium . it is shown that the equal - time commutation relations between the fundamental electromagnetic fields $ \hat e$ and $ \hat b$ and the potentials $ \hat a$ and $ \hat \phi$ in the coulomb gauge can be expressed in terms of the green tensor of the classical problem . from the green tensors for bulk material and an inhomogeneous medium consisting of two bulk dielectrics with a common planar interface it is explicitly proven that the well - known equal - time commutation relations of qed are preserved .
