the dynamics of systems subjected to noise is called markovian in the absence of memory effects , i.e. when its immediate future only depends on its present . time correlations in the noise source may generate non - markovian effects that , sometimes , can be erased by appropriately coarse graining the time evolution of the system . in general , the coarse graining time $ t_\text{cg}$ is taken to be much larger than the correlation time $ \tau$ but no direct relation between them is established . here we analytically obtain a relation between $ t_\text{cg}$ and $ \tau$ for the dynamics of a qubit subjected to a time correlated environment . our results can be applied in principle to any distribution of the environmental correlations and can be tested through a collisional model where the qubit sequentially interacts with correlated qutrits .
