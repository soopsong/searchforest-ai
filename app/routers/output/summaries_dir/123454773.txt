a formulation of quantum mechanics , which begins by postulating assertions for individual physical systems , is given . the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics for infinite ensembles are then derived from its assertions for individual systems . a discussion of the meaning of the"state"of an individual quantum mechanical system is given , and an application is made to the clarification of some of the paradoxical features of the theory .
