in this paper , we study the effect of classical driving field on the spontaneous emission spectrum of a qubit embedded in a dissipative cavity . furthermore , we monitor the entanglement dynamics of the driven qubit with its radiative decay under the action of the classical field . afterwards , we carry out an investigation on the possibility of entanglement swapping between two such distinct driven qubits . the swapping will be feasible with the aid of a bell state measurement performing on the photons leaving the cavities . it is demonstrated that the classical driving field has a beneficial effect on the prolonging of the swapped entanglement .
