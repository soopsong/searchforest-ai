unidirectional surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) at the interface between a gyrotropic medium and a simple medium are studied in a newly - recognized frequency regime wherein the spps form narrow , beam - like patterns due to hyperbolic dispersion . the spp beams are steerable by controlling parameters such as the cyclotron frequency ( external bias ) or the frequency of operation . the bulk band structure along different propagation directions is examined to ascertain a common bandgap , valid for all propagation directions , which the spps cross . the case of a finite - thickness gyrotropic slab is also considered , for which we present the green function and examine the thickness and loss level required to maintain a unidirectional spp .
