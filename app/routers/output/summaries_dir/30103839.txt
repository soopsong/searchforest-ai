we present the software library libcreme which we have previously used to successfully calculate convex - roof entanglement measures of mixed quantum states appearing in realistic physical systems . evaluating the amount of entanglement in such states is in general a non - trivial task requiring to solve a highly non - linear complex optimization problem . the algorithms provided here are able to achieve to do this for a large and important class of entanglement measures . the library is mostly written in the matlab programming language , but is fully compatible to the free and open - source octave platform . some inefficient subroutines are written in c / c++ for better performance . this manuscript discusses the most important theoretical concepts and workings of the algorithms , focussing on the actual implementation and usage within the library . detailed examples in the end should make it easy for the user to apply libcreme to specific problems .
