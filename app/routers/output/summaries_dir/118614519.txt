there has been rapid development of systems that yield strong interactions between freely propagating photons in one dimension via controlled coupling to quantum emitters . this raises interesting possibilities such as quantum information processing with photons or quantum many - body states of light , but treating such systems generally remains a difficult task theoretically . here , we describe a novel technique in which the dynamics and correlations of a few photons can be exactly calculated , based upon knowledge of the initial photonic state and the solution of the reduced effective dynamics of the quantum emitters alone . we show that this generalized"input - output"formalism allows for a straightforward numerical implementation regardless of system details , such as emitter positions , external driving , and level structure . as a specific example , we apply our technique to show how atomic systems with infinite - range interactions and under conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency enable the selective transmission of correlated multi - photon states .
