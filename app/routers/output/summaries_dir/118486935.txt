we propose a type of non - anticommutative superspace , with the interesting property of relating to lee - wick type of higher derivatives theories , which are known for their interesting properties , and have lead to proposals of phenomenologicaly viable higher derivatives extensions of the standard model . the deformation of superspace we consider does not preserve supersymmetry or associativity in general ; however , we show that a non - anticommutative version of the wess - zumino model can be properly defined . in fact , the definition of chiral and antichiral superfields turns out to be simpler in our case than in the well known $ { \cal n}=1/2 $ supersymmetric case . we show that , when the theory is truncated at the first nontrivial order in the deformation parameter , supersymmetry is restored , and we end up with a well known lee - wick type of higher derivative extension of the wess - zumino model . thus we show how non - anticommutative could provide an alternative mechanism for generation of these kind of higher derivative theories .
