we study the effects that the gravitational interaction of $ f(r)$ theories of gravity in palatini formalism has on the stationary states of the hydrogen atom . we show that the role of gravity in this system is very important for lagrangians $ f(r)$ with terms that grow at low curvatures , which have been proposed to explain the accelerated expansion rate of the universe . we find that new gravitationally induced terms in the atomic hamiltonian generate a strong backreaction that is incompatible with the very existence of bound states . in fact , in the 1 / r model , hydrogen disintegrates in less than two hours . the universe that we observe is , therefore , incompatible with that kind of gravitational interaction . lagrangians with high curvature corrections do not lead to such instabilities .
