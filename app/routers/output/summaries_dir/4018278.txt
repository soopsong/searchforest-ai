we briefly review single - qubit quantum process tomography for trace - preserving and nontrace - preserving processes , and derive explicit forms of the general constraints for fitting experimental data . these new forms provide additional insight into the structure of the process matrix . we illustrate their utility with several examples , including a discussion of qubit leakage error models and the intuition which can be gained from their process matrices .
