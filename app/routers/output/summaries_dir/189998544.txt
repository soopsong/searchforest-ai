quantum computers will allow calculations beyond existing classical computers . however , current technology is still too noisy and imperfect to construct a universal digital quantum computer with quantum error correction . inspired by the evolution of classical computation , an alternative paradigm merging the flexibility of digital quantum computation with the robustness of analog quantum simulation has emerged . this universal paradigm is known as digital - analog quantum computing . here , we introduce an efficient digital - analog quantum algorithm to compute the quantum fourier transform , a subroutine widely employed in several relevant quantum algorithms . we show that , under reasonable assumptions about noise models , the fidelity of the quantum fourier transformation improves considerably using this approach when the number of qubits involved grows . this suggests that , in the noisy intermediate - scale quantum ( nisq ) era , hybrid protocols combining digital and analog quantum computing could be a sensible approach to reach useful quantum supremacy .
