we study the collective effects that emerge in waveguide quantum electrodynamics where several ( artificial ) atoms are coupled to a one - dimensional superconducting transmission line . since single microwave photons can travel without loss for a long distance along the line , real and virtual photons emitted by one atom can be reabsorbed or scattered by a second atom . depending on the distance between the atoms , this collective effect can lead to super- and subradiance or to a coherent exchange - type interaction between the atoms . changing the artificial atoms transition frequencies , something which can be easily done with superconducting qubits ( two levels artificial atoms ) , is equivalent to changing the atom - atom separation and thereby opens the possibility to study the characteristics of these collective effects . to study this waveguide quantum electrodynamics system , we extend previous work and present an effective master equation valid for an ensemble of inhomogeneous atoms driven by a coherent state . using input - output theory , we compute analytically and numerically the elastic and inelastic scattering and show how these quantities reveal information about collective effects . these theoretical results are compatible with recent experimental results using transmon qubits coupled to a superconducting one - dimensional transmission line [ a.~f.~van loo { \it et al . } ] .
