we describe how to generate an einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) paradox between a mesoscopic mechanical oscillator and an optical pulse . we find two types of paradox , defined by whether it is the oscillator or the pulse that shows the effect schrodinger called"steering " . only the oscillator paradox addresses the question of mesoscopic local reality for a massive system . in that case , epr's"elements of reality"are defined for the oscillator , and it is these elements of reality that are falsified ( if quantum mechanics is complete ) . for this sort of paradox , we show that a thermal barrier exists , meaning that a threshold level of pulse - oscillator interaction is required for a given thermal occupation n_0 of the oscillator . we find there is no equivalent thermal barrier for the entanglement of the pulse with the oscillator , nor for the epr paradox that addresses the local reality of the optical system . finally , we examine the possibility of an epr paradox between two entangled oscillators . our work highlights the asymmetrical effect of thermal noise on quantum nonlocality .
