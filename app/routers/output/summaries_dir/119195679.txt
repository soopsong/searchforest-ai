the hawking flux from a black hole , ( at least as seen from asymptotic infinity ) , is extremely sparse and thin , with the average time between emission of the successive hawking quanta being many times larger than the natural timescale set by the energies of the emitted quanta . while this result has been known for over 30 years , it has largely been forgotten . we shall focus on the early - stage low - temperature regime , and shall confront numerical estimates with semi - analytic approximations based on a naive planck spectrum . first we shall identify several natural dimensionless figures of merit , and thereby compare the mean time between emission of successive hawking quanta to several distinct but quite natural timescales that can be associated with the emitted quanta , demonstrating that very large ratios are typical for emission of massless quanta from a schwarzschild black hole . furthermore these ratios are independent of the mass of the black hole as it slowly evolves . we shall then show that the situation for the more general reissner - nordstrom and generic"dirty ' ' black holes is even worse , at least as long as the surrounding matter satisfies some suitable energy conditions . the situation for the kerr and kerr -- newman black holes ( or even for charged particle emission from a reissner -- nordstrom black hole ) is considerably trickier , and depends on a careful accounting of the super - radiant modes . overall , the hawking quanta are seen to be dribbling out of the black hole one at a time , in an extremely slow cascade of 2-body decays . among other things , this implies that the hawking flux is subject to"shot noise ' ' . observationally , the planck spectrum of the hawking flux can only be determined by collecting and integrating data over a very long timescale . we conclude by connecting these points back to various kinematic aspects of the hawking evaporation process .
