a method to establish a qubit decomposition of a general qudit state is presented . this new representation allows a geometrical depiction of any qudit state in the bloch sphere . additionally , we show that the nonnegativity conditions of the qudit state imply the existence of quantum correlations between the qubits which compose it . these correlations are used to define new inequalities which the density matrices components must satisfy . the importance of such inequalities in the reconstruction of a qudit state is addressed . as an example of the general procedure the qubit decomposition of a qutrit system is shown , which allows a classification of the qutrit states by fixing their invariants $ { \rm tr}(\hat{\rho}^2)$ , $ { \rm tr}(\hat{\rho}^3)$.
