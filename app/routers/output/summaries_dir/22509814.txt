we report a study of optomechanical entanglement under the drive of one or a series of laser pulses with arbitrary detuning and different pulse shapes . because of the non - existence of system steady state under pulsed driving field , we adopt a different approach from the standard treatment to optomechanical entanglement . the situation of the entanglement evolution in high temperature is also discussed .
