we study the generation of entangled states using a device constructed from dipolar bosons confined to a triple - well potential . dipolar bosons possess controllable , long - range interactions . this property permits specific choices to be made for the coupling parameters , such that the system is integrable . integrability assists in the analysis of the system via an effective hamiltonian constructed through a conserved operator . through computations of fidelity we establish that this approach , to study the time - evolution of the entanglement for a class of non - entangled initial states , yields accurate approximations given by analytic formulae .
