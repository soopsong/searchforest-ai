beyond the use of genuine monolithic integrated optical platforms , we report here a hybrid strategy enabling on - chip generation of configurable heralded two - photon states . more specifically , we combine two different fabrication techniques , \textit{i.e . } , non - linear waveguides on lithium niobate for efficient photon - pair generation and femtosecond - laser - direct - written waveguides on glass for photon manipulation . through real - time device manipulation capabilities , a variety of path - coded heralded two - photon states can be produced , ranging from product to entangled states . those states are engineered with high levels of purity , assessed by fidelities of 99.5$\pm$8\% and 95.0$\pm$8\% , respectively , obtained via quantum interferometric measurements . our strategy therefore stands as a milestone for further exploiting entanglement - based protocols , relying on engineered quantum states , and enabled by scalable and compatible photonic circuits .
