knowledge of the dynamical behavior of correlations with no classical counterpart , like entanglement , nonlocal correlations and quantum discord , in open quantum systems is of primary interest because of the possibility to exploit these correlations for quantum information tasks . here we review some of the most recent results on the dynamics of correlations in bipartite systems embedded in non - markovian environments that , with their memory effects , influence in a relevant way the system dynamics and appear to be more fundamental than the markovian ones for practical purposes . firstly , we review the phenomenon of entanglement revivals in a two - qubit system for both independent environments and a common environment . we then consider the dynamics of quantum discord in non - markovian dephasing channel and briefly discuss the occurrence of revivals of quantum correlations in classical environments .
