for reliable and consistent quantum information processing carried out on a quantum network , the network structure must be fully known and a desired initial state must be accurately prepared on it . in this paper , for a class of spin networks with its single node only accessible , we provide two continuous - measurement - based methods to achieve the above requirements ; the first one identifies the unknown network structure with high probability , based on continuous - time bayesian update of the graph structure ; the second one is , with the use of adaptive measurement technique , able to deterministically drive any mixed state to a spin coherent state for network initialization .
