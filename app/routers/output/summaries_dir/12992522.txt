macroscopic realism , the classical world view that macroscopic objects exist independently of and are not influenced by measurements , is usually tested using leggett - garg inequalities . recently , another necessary condition called no - signaling in time ( nsit ) has been proposed as a witness for non - classical behavior . in this paper , we show that a combination of nsit conditions is not only necessary but also sufficient for a macrorealistic description of a physical system . any violation of macroscopic realism must therefore be witnessed by a suitable nsit condition . subsequently , we derive an operational formulation for nsit in terms of positive operator - valued measurements and the system hamiltonian . we argue that this leads to a suitable definition of"classical"measurements and hamiltonians , and apply our formalism to some generic coarse - grained quantum measurements .
