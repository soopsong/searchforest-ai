we analyze the quantum capacity of a unital quantum channel , using ideas from the proof of near - optimality of petz recovery map [ barnum and knill 2000 ] and give an upper bound on the quantum capacity in terms of regularized output $ 2$-norm of the channel . we also show that any code attempting to exceed this upper bound must incur large error in decoding , which can be viewed as a weaker version of the strong converse results for quantum capacity . as an application , we find nearly matching upper and lower bounds ( up to an additive constant ) on the quantum capacity of quantum expander channels . using these techniques , we further conclude that the ` mixture of random unitaries ' channels arising in the construction of quantum expanders in [ hastings 2007 ] show a trend in multiplicativity of output $ 2$-norm similar to that exhibited in [ montanaro 2013 ] for output $ \infty$-norm of random quantum channels .
