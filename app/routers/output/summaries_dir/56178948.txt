we study the distribution of quantum correlations characterized by monogamy relations in multipartite systems . by using the hamming weight of the binary vectors associated with the subsystems , we establish a class of monogamy inequalities for multiqubit entanglement based on the $ \alpha$th ( $ \alpha\geq 2 $ ) power of concurrence , and a class of polygamy inequalities for multiqubit entanglement in terms of the $ \beta$th ( $ 0\leq \beta\leq2 $ ) power of concurrence and concurrence of assistance . moveover , we give the monogamy and polygamy inequalities for general quantum correlations . application of these results to quantum correlations like squared convex - roof extended negativity ( scren ) , entanglement of formation and tsallis-$q$ entanglement gives rise to either tighter inequalities than the existing ones for some classes of quantum states or less restrictions on the quantum states . detailed examples are presented .
