controllability properties for discrete - time , markovian quantum dynamics are investigated . we find that , while in general the controlled system is not finite - time controllable , feedback control allows for arbitrary asymptotic state - to - state transitions . under further assumption on the form of the measurement , we show that finite - time controllability can be achieved in a time that scales linearly with the dimension of the system , and we provide an iterative procedure to design the unitary control actions .
