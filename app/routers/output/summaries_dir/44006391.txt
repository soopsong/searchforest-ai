quantum entanglement has been regarded as one of the key physical resources in quantum information sciences . however , the determination of whether a mixed state is entangled or not is generally a hard issue , even for the bipartite system . in this work we propose an operational necessary and sufficient criterion for the separability of an arbitrary bipartite mixed state , by virtue of the multiplicative horn 's problem . the work follows the work initiated by horodecki { \it et . al . } and uses the bloch vector representation introduced to the separability problem by j. de vicente . in our criterion , a complete and finite set of inequalities to determine the separability of compound system is obtained , which may be viewed as trade - off relations between the quantumness of subsystems . we apply the obtained result to explicit examples , e.g. the separable decomposition of arbitrary dimension werner state and isotropic state .
