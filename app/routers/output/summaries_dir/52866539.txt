understanding the interaction between light and matter is very relevant for fundamental studies of quantum electrodynamics and for the development of quantum technologies . the quantum rabi model captures the physics of a single atom interacting with a single photon at all regimes of coupling strength . we report the spectroscopic observation of a resonant transition that breaks a selection rule in the quantum rabi model , implemented using an $ lc$ resonator and an artificial atom , a superconducting qubit . the eigenstates of the system consist of a superposition of bare qubit - resonator states with a relative sign . when the qubit - resonator coupling strength is negligible compared to their own frequencies , the matrix element between excited eigenstates of different sign is very small in presence of a resonator drive , establishing a sign - preserving selection rule . here , our qubit - resonator system operates in the ultrastrong coupling regime , where the coupling strength is 10\% of the resonator frequency , allowing sign - changing transitions to be activated and , therefore , detected . this work shows that sign - changing transitions are an unambiguous , distinctive signature of systems operating in the ultrastrong coupling regime of the quantum rabi model . these results pave the way to further studies of sign - preserving selection rules in multiqubit and multiphoton models .
