probabilities of vibronic transitions in molecules are referred to as franck - condon factors ( fcfs ) . although several approaches for calculating fcfs have been developed , such calculations are still challenging . recently it was shown that there exists a correspondence between the problem of calculating fcfs and boson sampling . however , if the output photon number distribution of boson sampling is sparse then it can be classically simulated . exploiting these results , we develop a method to approximately reconstruct the distribution of fcfs of certain molecules . we demonstrate this method by applying it to formic acid and thymine at $ 0 $ k. in our method , we first obtain the marginal photon number distributions for pairs of modes of a gaussian state associated with the molecular transition . we then apply a compressive sensing method called polynomial - time matching pursuit to recover fcfs .
