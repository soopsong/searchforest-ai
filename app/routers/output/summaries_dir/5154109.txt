we discuss the optimization of optical microcavity designs based on 2d photonic crystals for the purpose of strong coupling between the cavity field and a single neutral atom trapped within a hole . we present numerical predictions for the quality factors and mode volumes of localized defect modes as a function of geometric parameters , and discuss some experimental challenges related to the coupling of a defect cavity to gas - phase atoms .
