we present a practical scheme for the decomposition of a bipartite mixed state into a sum of direct products of local density matrices , using the technique developed in li and qiao ( sci . rep . 8 : 1442 , 2018 ) . in the scheme , the correlation matrix which characterizes the bipartite entanglement is first decomposed into two matrices composed of the bloch vectors of local states . then we show that the symmetries of bloch vectors are consistent with that of the correlation matrix , and the magnitudes of the local bloch vectors are lower bounded by the correlation matrix . concrete examples for the separable decompositions of bipartite mixed states are presented for illustration .
