we trap individual $ ^{171}$yb$^+$ ions in a surface trap microfabricated on a silicon substrate , and demonstrate a complete set of high fidelity single qubit operations for the hyperfine qubit . trapping times exceeding 20 minutes without laser cooling , and heating rates as low as 0.8(0.1 ) quanta / ms indicate stable trapping conditions in these microtraps . a coherence time of more than one second , high fidelity qubit state detection and single qubit rotations are demonstrated .
