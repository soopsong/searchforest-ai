we discuss the tomography of $ n$-qubit states using collective measurements . the method is exact for symmetric states , whereas for not completely symmetric states the information accessible can be arranged as a mixture of irreducible su(2 ) blocks . for the fully symmetric sector , the reconstruction protocol can be reduced to projections onto a canonically chosen set of pure states .
