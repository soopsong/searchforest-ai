quantum walks have been useful for designing quantum algorithms that outperform their classical versions for a variety of search problems . most of the papers , however , consider a search space containing a single marked element only . we show that if the search space contains more than one marked element , their placement may drastically affect the performance of the search . more specifically , we study search by quantum walks on general graphs and show a wide class of configurations of marked vertices , for which search by quantum walk needs $ \omega(n)$ steps , that is , it has no speed - up over the classical exhaustive search . the demonstrated configurations occur for certain placements of two or more adjacent marked vertices . the analysis is done for the two - dimensional grid and hypercube , and then is generalized for any graph .
