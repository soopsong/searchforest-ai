we revisit the question of universality in quantum computing and propose a new paradigm . instead of forcing a physical system to enact a predetermined set of universal gates ( e.g. , single - qubit operations and cnot ) , we focus on the intrinsic ability of a system to act as a universal quantum computer using only its naturally available interactions . a key element of this approach is the realization that the fungible nature of quantum information allows for universal manipulations using quantum information encoded in a subspace of the full system hilbert space , as an alternative to using physical qubits directly . starting with the interactions intrinsic to the physical system , we show how to determine the possible universality resulting from these interactions over an encoded subspace . we outline a general lie - algebraic framework which can be used to find the encoding for universality and give several examples relevant to solid - state quantum computing .
