for sharp quantum observables the following facts hold : ( i ) if we have a collection of sharp observables and each pair of them is jointly measurable , then they are jointly measurable all together ; ( ii ) if two sharp observables are jointly measurable , then their joint observable is unique and it gives the greatest lower bound for the effects corresponding to the observables ; ( iii ) if we have two sharp observables and their every possible two outcome partitionings are jointly measurable , then the observables themselves are jointly measurable . we show that , in general , these properties do not hold . also some possible candidates which would accompany joint measurability and generalize these apparently useful properties are discussed .
