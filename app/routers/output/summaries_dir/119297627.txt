quantum chemistry provides a target for quantum simulation of considerable scientific interest and industrial importance . the majority of algorithms to date have been based on a second - quantized representation of the electronic structure hamiltonian - necessitating qubit requirements that scale linearly with the number of orbitals . the scaling of the number of gates for such methods , while polynomial , presents some serious experimental challenges . however , because the number of electrons is a good quantum number for the electronic structure problem it is unnecessary to store the full fock space of the orbitals . representation of the wave function in a basis of slater determinants for fixed electron number suffices . however , to date techniques for the quantum simulation of the hamiltonian represented in this basis - the ci - matrix - have been lacking . we show how to apply techniques developed for the simulation of sparse hamiltonians to the ci - matrix . we prove a number of results exploiting the structure of the ci - matrix , arising from the slater rules which define it , to improve the application of sparse hamiltonian simulation techniques in this case . we show that it is possible to use the minimal number of qubits to represent the wavefunction , and that these methods can offer improved scaling in the number of gates required in the limit of fixed electron number and increasing basis set size relevant for high - accuracy calculations . we hope these results open the door to further investigation of sparse hamiltonian simulation techniques in the context of the quantum simulation of quantum chemistry .
