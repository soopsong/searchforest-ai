we demonstrate the capability to discretize the frequency spectrum of broadband energy - time entangled photons by means of a spatial light modulator to encode qudits in various bases . exemplarily , we implement three different discretization schemes , namely frequency bins , time bins and schmidt modes . entangled qudits up to dimension $ d=4 $ are then revealed by two - photon interference experiments with visibilities violating a $ d$-dimensional bell inequality .
