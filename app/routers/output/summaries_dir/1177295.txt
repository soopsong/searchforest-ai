we investigate trapping geometries for cold , neutral atoms that can be created in the evanescent field of a tapered optical fibre by combining the fundamental mode with one of the next lowest possible modes , namely the he21 mode . counter propagating red - detuned he21 modes are combined with a blue - detuned he11 fundamental mode to form a potential in the shape of four intertwined spirals . by changing the polar- ization from circular to linear in each of the two counter - propagating he21 modes simultaneously the 4-helix configuration can be transformed into a lattice configuration . the modification to the 4-helix configuration due to unwanted excitation of the the t e01 and t m01 modes is also discussed .
