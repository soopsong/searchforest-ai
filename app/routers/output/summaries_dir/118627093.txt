we study 2-dimensional logarithmic galilean conformal algebra ( lgca ) by making use of a contraction of topologically massive gravity at critical point . we observe that using a naive contraction at the critical point fails to give a well defined theory , though contracting the theory while we are approaching the critical point leads to a well behaved expressions for two point functions of the energy - momentum tensors of lgca .
