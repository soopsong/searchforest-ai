we present and analyze a novel concept for blue - detuned evanescent field surface traps for cold neutral atoms based on two - mode interference in ultra - thin optical fibres . when two or more transverse modes with the same frequency co - propagate in the fibre , their different phase velocities cause a stationary interference pattern to establish . intensity minima of the evanescent field at any distance from the fibre surface can be created and an array of optical microtraps can thus be obtained in the evanescent field . we discuss three possible combinations of the lowest order modes , yielding traps at one to two hundred nanometres from the fibre surface which , using a few ten milliwatts of trapping laser power , have a depth on the order of 1 mk for caesium atoms and a trapping lifetime exceeding 100 seconds . the resulting trapping geometry is of particular interest because atoms in such microtrap arrays will be coupled to any additional field propagating in the fibre via the evanescent field , thereby realising ensembles of fibre - coupled atoms .
