quantum steering has recently been formalized in the framework of a resource theory of steering , and several quantifiers have already been introduced . here , we propose an information - theoretic quantifier for steering called intrinsic steerability , which uses conditional mutual information to measure the deviation of a given assemblage from one having a local hidden - state model . we thus relate conditional mutual information to quantum steering and introduce monotones that satisfy certain desirable properties . the idea behind the quantifier is to suppress the correlations that can be explained by an inaccessible quantum system and then quantify the remaining intrinsic correlations . a variant of the intrinsic steerability finds operational meaning as the classical communication cost of sending the measurement choice and outcome to an eavesdropper who possesses a purifying system of the underlying bipartite quantum state that is being measured .
