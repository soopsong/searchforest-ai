we demonstrate high - fidelity zeeman qubit state detection in a single trapped 88 sr+ ion . qubit readout is performed by shelving one of the qubit states to a metastable level using a narrow linewidth diode laser at 674 nm followed by state - selective fluorescence detection . the average fidelity reached for the readout of the qubit state is 0.9989(1 ) . we then measure the fidelity of state tomography , averaged over all possible single - qubit states , which is 0.9979(2 ) . we also fully characterize the detection process using quantum process tomography . this readout fidelity is compatible with recent estimates of the detection error - threshold required for fault - tolerant computation , whereas high - fidelity state tomography opens the way for high - precision quantum process tomography .
