this paper is concerned with the coherent quantum linear quadratic gaussian ( cqlqg ) control problem of finding a stabilizing measurement - free quantum controller for a quantum plant so as to minimize an infinite - horizon mean square performance index for the fully quantum closed - loop system . in comparison with the observation - actuation structure of classical controllers , the coherent quantum feedback is less invasive to the quantum dynamics and quantum information . both the plant and the controller are open quantum systems whose dynamic variables satisfy the canonical commutation relations ( ccrs ) of a quantum harmonic oscillator and are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations ( qsdes ) . in order to correspond to such oscillators , these qsdes must satisfy physical realizability ( pr ) conditions , which are organised as quadratic constraints on the controller matrices and reflect the preservation of ccrs in time . the cqlqg problem is a constrained optimization problem for the steady - state quantum covariance matrix of the plant - controller system satisfying an algebraic lyapunov equation . we propose a gradient descent algorithm equipped with adaptive stepsize selection for the numerical solution of the problem . the algorithm finds a local minimum of the lqg cost over the parameters of the hamiltonian and coupling operators of a stabilizing pr quantum controller , thus taking the pr constraints into account . a convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented . a numerical example of a locally optimal cqlqg controller design is provided to demonstrate the algorithm performance .
