we formulate entropic measurements uncertainty relations ( murs ) for a spin-1/2 system . when incompatible observables are approximatively jointly measured , we use relative entropy to quantify the information lost in approximation and we prove positive lower bounds for such a loss : there is an unavoidable information loss . firstly we allow only for covariant approximate joint measurements and we find state - dependent murs for two or three orthogonal spin-1/2 components . secondly we consider any possible approximate joint measurement and we find state - independent murs for two or three spin-1/2 components . in particular we study how murs depend on the angle between two spin directions . finally , we extend our approach to infinitely many incompatible observables , namely to the spin components in all possible directions . in every scenario , we always consider also the characterization of the optimal approximate joint measurements .
