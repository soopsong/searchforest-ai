we give bounds on the average fidelity achievable by any quantum state estimator , which is arguably the most prominently used figure of merit in quantum state tomography . moreover , these bounds can be computed online --- that is , while the experiment is running . we show numerically that these bounds are quite tight for relevant distributions of density matrices . we also show that the bayesian mean estimator is ideal in the sense of performing close to the bound without requiring optimization . our results hold for all finite dimensional quantum systems .
