for a singular probability measure $ \mu$ on the circle , we show the existence of positive matrices on the unit disc which admit a boundary representation on the unit circle with respect to $ \mu$. these positive matrices are constructed in several different ways using the kaczmarz algorithm . some of these positive matrices correspond to the projection of the szeg\h{o } kernel on the disc to certain subspaces of the hardy space corresponding to the normalized cauchy transform of $ \mu$. other positive matrices are obtained which correspond to subspaces of the hardy space after a renormalization , and so are not projections of the szeg\h{o } kernel . we show that these positive matrices are a generalization of a spectrum or fourier frame for $ \mu$ , and the existence of such a positive matrix does not require $ \mu$ to be spectral .
