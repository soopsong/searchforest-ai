the so - called permutation separability criteria are simple operational conditions that are necessary for separability of mixed states of multipartite systems : ( 1 ) permute the indices of the density matrix and ( 2 ) check if the trace norm of at least one of the resulting operators is greater than one . if it is greater than one then the state is necessarily entangled . a shortcoming of the permutation separability criteria is that many permutations give rise to dependent separability criteria . therefore , we introduce a necessary condition for two permutations to yield independent criteria called combinatorical independence . this condition basically means that the map corresponding to one permutation can not be obtained by concatenating the map corresponding to the second permutation with a norm - preserving map . we characterize completely combinatorically independent criteria , and determine simple permutations that represent all independent criteria . the representatives can be visualized by means of a simple graphical notation . they are composed of three basic operations : partial transpose , and two types of so - called reshufflings . in particular , for a four - partite system all criteria except one are composed of partial transpose and only one type of reshuffling ; the exceptional one requires the second type of reshuffling . furthermore , we show how to obtain efficiently for every permutation a simple representative . this method allows to check easily if two permutations are combinatorically equivalent or not .
