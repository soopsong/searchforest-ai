light - matter interactions in conventional nanophotonic structures typically lack directionality . furthermore , surface waves supported by conventional material substrates do not usually have a preferential direction of propagation , and their wavefront tends to spread as it propagates along the surface , unless the surface or the excitation are properly engineered and structured . in this article , we theoretically demonstrate the possibility of realizing \emph{unidirectional and diffractionless surface - plasmon - polariton modes } on a nonreciprocal platform , namely , a gyrotropic magnetized plasma . based on a rigorous green function approach , we provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis of all the available physical mechanisms that may bestow the system with directionality , both in the sense of one - way excitation of surface waves , and in the sense of directive diffractionless propagation along the surface . the considered mechanisms include ( i ) the effect of strong and weak forms of nonreciprocity , ( ii ) the elliptic - like or hyperbolic - like topology of the modal dispersion surfaces , and ( iii ) the source polarization state , with the associated possibility of chiral surface - wave excitation governed by angular - momentum matching . we find that three - dimensional gyrotropic plasmonic platforms support a previously - unnoticed wave - propagation regime that exhibit several of these physical mechanisms simultaneously , allowing us to theoretically demonstrate , for the first time , unidirectional surface - plasmon - polariton modes that propagate as a single ultra - narrow diffractionless beam . we also assess the impact of dissipation and nonlocal effects . our theoretical findings may enable a new generation of plasmonic structures and devices with highly directional response .
