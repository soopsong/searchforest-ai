recent experiments on strongly coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics present new directions in"matter - light"systems . following on from our previous work [ phys . rev . lett . 102 , 135301 ( 2009 ) ] we investigate bose - hubbard models coupled to a cavity light field . we discuss the emergence of photoexcitations or"polaritons"within the mott phase , and obtain the complete variational phase diagram . exploiting connections to the super - radiance transition in the dicke model we discuss the nature of polariton condensation within this novel state . incorporating the effects of carrier superfluidity , we identify a first - order transition between the superradiant mott phase and the single component atomic superfluid . the overall predictions of mean field theory are in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization and we provide details of superfluid fractions , density fluctuations , and finite size effects . we highlight connections to recent work on coupled cavity arrays .
