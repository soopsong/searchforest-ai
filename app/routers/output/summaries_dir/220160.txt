we introduce noncommutative phase spaces by minimal couplings ( usual one , dual one and their mixing ) . we then realize some of them as coadjoint orbits of the anisotropic newton - hooke groups in two- and three - dimensional spaces . through these constructions the positions and the momenta of the phase spaces do not commute due to the presence of a magnetic field and a dual magnetic field .
