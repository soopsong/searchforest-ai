we present a detailed analysis of a new robust quantum repeater architecture building on the original dlcz protocol [ l.m . duan \textit{et al . } , nature ( london ) \textbf{414 } , 413 ( 2001 ) ] . the new architecture is based on two - photon hong - ou - mandel - type interference which relaxes the long - distance interferometric stability requirements by about 7 orders of magnitude , from sub - wavelength for the single photon interference required by dlcz to the coherence length of the photons , thereby removing the weakest point in the dlcz schema . our proposal provides an exciting possibility for robust and realistic long - distance quantum communication .
