the subject of this work has its roots in the so - called schr√∂dginer bridge problem ( sbp ) which asks for the most likely distribution of brownian particles in their passage between observed empirical marginal distributions at two distinct points in time . renewed interest in this problem was sparked by a reformulation in the language of stochastic control . in earlier works , presented as part i and part ii , we explored a generalization of the original sbp that amounts to optimal steering of linear stochastic dynamical systems between state - distributions , at two points in time , under full state feedback . in these works , the cost was quadratic in the control input , i.e. , control energy . the purpose of the present work is to detail the technical steps in extending the framework to the case where a quadratic cost in the state is also present . thus , the main contribution is to derive the optimal control in this case which in fact is given in closed - form ( theorem 1 ) . in the zero - noise limit , we also obtain the solution of a ( deterministic ) mass transport problem with general quadratic cost .
