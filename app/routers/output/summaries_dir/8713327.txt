in this paper we analyze the ( im)possibility of the exact distinguishability of orthogonal multipartite entangled states under { \em restricted local operation and classical communication } . based on this local distinguishability analysis we propose a new scheme for quantum secret sharing ( qss ) . our qss scheme is quite general and cost efficient compared to other schemes . in our scheme no joint quantum operation is needed to reconstruct the secret . we also present an interesting $ ( 2,n)$-threshold qss scheme , where any two cooperating players , one from each of two disjoint groups of players , can always reconstruct the secret . this qss scheme is quite uncommon , as most $ ( k , n)$-threshold schemes have the restriction $ k\geq\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$.
