we propose a way for transferring greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) entangled states from $ n$ qubits in one cavity onto another $ n$ qubits in the other cavity . it is shown that $ n$-qubit ghz states $ \alpha \left\vert 00 ... 0\right\rangle + \beta \left\vert 11 ... 1\right\rangle $ with arbitrary degree of entanglement can be transferred deterministically . both of the ghz state transfer and the operation time are not dependent on the number of qubits , and there is no need of measurement . this proposal is quite general and can be applied to accomplish the same task for a wide range of physical qubits . furthermore , note that the $ n$-qubit ghz state $ \alpha \left\vert 00 ... 0\right\rangle + \beta \left\vert 11 ... 1\right\rangle $ is a quantum - secret - sharing code for encoding a single - qubit arbitrary pure state $ \alpha \left\vert 0\right\rangle + \beta \left\vert 1\right\rangle $ . thus , this work also provides a way to transfer quantum secret sharing from $ n$ qubits in one cavity to another $ n$ qubits in the other cavity .
