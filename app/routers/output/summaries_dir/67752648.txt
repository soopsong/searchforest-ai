we experimentally realize an enhanced raman control scheme for neutral atoms that features an intrinsic suppression of the two - photon carrier transition , but retains the sidebands which couple to the external degrees of freedom of the trapped atoms . this is achieved by trapping the atom at the node of a blue detuned standing wave dipole trap , that acts as one field for the two - photon raman coupling . the improved ratio between cooling and heating processes in this configuration enables a five times lower fundamental temperature limit for resolved sideband cooling . we apply this method to perform raman cooling to the two - dimensional vibrational ground state and to coherently manipulate the atomic motion . the presented scheme requires minimal additional resources and can be applied to experiments with challenging optical access , as we demonstrate by our implementation for atoms strongly coupled to an optical cavity .
