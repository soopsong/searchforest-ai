visual tracking ( vt ) is the process of locating a moving object of interest in a video . it is a fundamental problem in computer vision , with various applications in human - computer interaction , security and surveillance , robot perception , traffic control , etc . in this paper , we address this problem for the first time in the quantum setting , and present a quantum algorithm for vt based on the framework proposed by henriques et al . [ ieee trans . pattern anal . mach . intell . , 7 , 583 ( 2015 ) ] . our algorithm comprises two phases : training and detection . in the training phase , in order to discriminate the object and background , the algorithm trains a ridge regression classifier in the quantum state form where the optimal fitting parameters of ridge regression are encoded in the amplitudes . in the detection phase , the classifier is then employed to generate a quantum state whose amplitudes encode the responses of all the candidate image patches . the algorithm is shown to be polylogarithmic in scaling , when the image data matrices have low condition numbers , and therefore may achieve exponential speedup over the best classical counterpart . however , only quadratic speedup can be achieved when the algorithm is applied to implement the ultimate task of henriques 's framework , i.e. , detecting the object position . we also discuss two other important applications related to vt : ( 1 ) object disappearance detection and ( 2 ) motion behavior matching , where much more significant speedup over the classical methods can be achieved . this work demonstrates the power of quantum computing in solving computer vision problems .
