deterministic coupling of single solid - state emitters to nanocavities is the key for integrated quantum information devices . we here fabricate a photonic crystal cavity around a preselected single silicon - vacancy color center in diamond and demonstrate modification of the emitters internal population dynamics and radiative quantum efficiency . the controlled , room - temperature cavity coupling gives rise to a resonant purcell enhancement of the zero - phonon transition by a factor of 19 , coming along with a 2.5-fold reduction of the emitter 's lifetime .
