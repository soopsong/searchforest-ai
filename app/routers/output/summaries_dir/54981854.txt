for any master equation which is local in time , whether markovian , non - markovian , of lindblad form or not , a general procedure is reviewed for constructing the corresponding linear map from the initial state to the state at time t , including its kraus - type representations . formally , this is equivalent to solving the master equation . for an n - dimensional hilbert space it requires ( i ) solving a first order n^2 x n^2 matrix time evolution ( to obtain the completely positive map ) , and ( ii ) diagonalising a related n^2 x n^2 matrix ( to obtain a kraus - type representation ) . conversely , for a given time - dependent linear map , a necessary and sufficient condition is given for the existence of a corresponding master equation , where the ( not necessarily unique ) form of this equation is explicitly determined . it is shown that a ` best possible ' master equation may always be defined , for approximating the evolution in the case that no exact master equation exists . examples involving qubits are given .
