tailoring the interactions between quantum emitters and single photons constitutes one of the cornerstones of quantum optics . coupling a quantum emitter to the band edge of a photonic crystal waveguide ( pcw ) provides a unique platform for tuning these interactions . in particular , the crossover from propagating fields $ e(x ) \propto e^{\pm ik_x x}$ outside the bandgap to localized fields $ e(x ) \propto e^{-\kappa_x |x|}$ within the bandgap should be accompanied by a transition from largely dissipative atom - atom interactions to a regime where dispersive atom - atom interactions are dominant . here , we experimentally observe this transition for the first time by shifting the band edge frequency of the pcw relative to the $ \rm d_1 $ line of atomic cesium for $ \bar{n}=3.0\pm 0.5 $ atoms trapped along the pcw . our results are the initial demonstration of this new paradigm for coherent atom - atom interactions with low dissipation into the guided mode .
