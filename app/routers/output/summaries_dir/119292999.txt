we report the first experimental demonstration of quantum delayed - choice experiment via nuclear magnetic resonance techniques . an ensemble of molecules each with two spin-1/2 nuclei are used as target and the ancilla qubits to perform the quantum circuit corresponding the delayed - choice setup . as expected in theory , our experiments clearly demonstrate the continuous morphing of the target qubit between particle - like and wave - like behaviors . the experimental visibility of the interference patterns shows good agreement with the theory .
