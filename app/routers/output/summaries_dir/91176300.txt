we investigate the problem of bounding the quantum process fidelity given bounds on the fidelities between target states and the action of a process on a set of pure input states . we formulate the problem as a semidefinite program and prove convexity of the minimum process fidelity as a function of the errors on the output states . we characterize the conditions required to uniquely determine a process in the case of no errors , and derive a lower bound on its fidelity in the limit of small errors for any set of input states satisfying these conditions . we then consider sets of input states whose one - dimensional projectors form a symmetric positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) . we prove that for such sets the minimum fidelity is bounded by a linear function of the average output state error . the minimal non - orthogonal symmetric povm contains $ d+1 $ states , where $ d$ is the hilbert space dimension . our bounds applied to these states provide an efficient method for estimating the process fidelity without the use of full process tomography .
