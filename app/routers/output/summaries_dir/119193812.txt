we use the approach of"transitionless quantum driving"proposed by berry to construct shortcuts to the population transfer and the creation of maximal entanglement between two $ \lambda $ -type atoms based on the cavity quantum electronic dynamics ( cqed ) system . an effective hamiltonian is designed by resorting to an auxiliary excited level , a classical driving field and an extra cavity field mode to supplement or substitute the original reference hamiltonian , and steer the system evolution along its instantaneous eigenstates in an arbitrarily short time , speeding up the rate of population transfer and creation of maximal entanglement between the two atoms inside a cavity . numerical simulation demonstrates that our shortcuts ' performance is robust against the decoherences caused by atomic spontaneous emission and cavity photon leakage .
