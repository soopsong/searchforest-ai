in most communication schemes information is transmitted via travelling modes of electromagnetic radiation . these modes are unavoidably subject to environmental noise along any physical transmission medium and the quality of the communication channel strongly depends on the minimum noise achievable at the output . for classical signals such noise can be rigorously quantified in terms of the associated shannon entropy and it is subject to a fundamental lower bound called entropy power inequality . electromagnetic fields are however quantum mechanical systems and then , especially in low intensity signals , the quantum nature of the information carrier can not be neglected and many important results derived within classical information theory require non - trivial extensions to the quantum regime . here we prove one possible generalization of the entropy power inequality to quantum bosonic systems . the impact of this inequality in quantum information theory is potentially large and some relevant implications are considered in this work .
