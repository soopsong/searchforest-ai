in this review article we revisit and spell out the details of previous work on how berry phase can be used to construct a precision quantum thermometer . an important advantage of such a scheme is that there is no need for the thermometer to acquire thermal equilibrium with the sample . this reduces measurement times and avoids precision limitations . we also review how such methods can be used to detect the unruh effect .
