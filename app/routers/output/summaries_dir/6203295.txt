quantum vacuum forces dictate the interaction between individual atoms and dielectric surfaces at nanoscale distances . for example , their large strengths typically overwhelm externally applied forces , which makes it challenging to controllably interface cold atoms with nearby nanophotonic systems . here , we show that it is possible to tailor the vacuum forces themselves to provide strong trapping potentials . the trapping scheme takes advantage of the attractive ground state potential and adiabatic dressing with an excited state whose potential is engineered to be resonantly enhanced and repulsive . this procedure yields a strong metastable trap , with the fraction of excited state population scaling inversely with the quality factor of the resonance of the dielectric structure . we analyze realistic limitations to the trap lifetime and discuss possible applications that might emerge from the large trap depths and nanoscale confinement .
