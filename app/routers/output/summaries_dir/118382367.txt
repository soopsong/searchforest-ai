we propose a surface ion trap design incorporating microwave control electrodes for near - field single - qubit control . the electrodes are arranged so as to provide arbitrary frequency , amplitude and polarization control of the microwave field in one trap zone , while a similar set of electrodes is used to null the residual microwave field in a neighbouring zone . the geometry is chosen to reduce the residual field to the 0.5 % level without nulling fields ; with nulling , the crosstalk may be kept close to the 0.01 % level for realistic microwave amplitude and phase drift . using standard photolithography and electroplating techniques , we have fabricated a proof - of - principle electrode array with two trapping zones . we discuss requirements for the microwave drive system and prospects for scalability to a large two - dimensional trap array .
