the present von neumann computing paradigm involves a significant amount of information transfer between a central processing unit ( cpu ) and memory , with concomitant limitations in the actual execution speed . however , it has been recently argued that a different form of computation , dubbed memcomputing [ nature physics , 9 , 200 - 202 ( 2013 ) ] and inspired by the operation of our brain , can resolve the intrinsic limitations of present day architectures by allowing for computing and storing of information on the same physical platform . here we show a simple and practical realization of memcomputing that utilizes easy - to - build memcapacitive systems . we name this architecture dynamic computing random access memory ( dcram ) . we show that dcram provides massively - parallel and polymorphic digital logic , namely it allows for different logic operations with the same architecture , by varying only the control signals . in addition , by taking into account realistic parameters , its energy expenditures can be as low as a few fj per operation . dcram is fully compatible with cmos technology , can be realized with current fabrication facilities , and therefore can really serve as an alternative to the present computing technology .
