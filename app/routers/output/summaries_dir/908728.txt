we consider the problem of switching off unwanted interactions in a given multi - partite hamiltonian . this is known to be an important primitive in quantum information processing and several schemes have been presented in the literature to achieve this task . a method to construct decoupling schemes for quantum systems of pairwise interacting qubits was introduced by m. stollsteimer and g. mahler and is based on orthogonal arrays . another approach based on triples of hadamard matrices that are closed under pointwise multiplication was proposed by d. leung . in this paper , we show that both methods lead to the same class of decoupling schemes . moreover , we establish a characterization of orthogonal arrays by showing that they are equivalent to decoupling schemes which allow a refinement into equidistant time - slots . furthermore , we show that decoupling schemes for networks of higher - dimensional quantum systems with t - local hamiltonians can be constructed from classical error - correcting codes .
