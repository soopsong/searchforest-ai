the linear coupling of a rotating heat bath to a quantum field is studied in the framework of the markovian master equation for the field 's non - unitary time evolution . the bath 's rotation induces population inversion for the field 's low - energy modes . for bosons , this leads to superradiance , an irreversible process in which some of the bath 's kinetic energy is extracted by spontaneous and stimulated emission . we find the energy and entropy balance for such systems and apply our results to the theory of black hole radiation . we also comment on how this relates to classical self - oscillations , including shear flow instabilities in hydrodynamics .
