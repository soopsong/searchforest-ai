we find a protocol transmitting two quantum states crossly in the butterfly network only with prior entanglement between two senders . this protocol requires only one qubit transmission or two classical bits transmission in each channel in the butterfly network . it is also proved that it is impossible without prior entanglement . more precisely , an upper bound of average fidelity is given in the butterfly network when prior entanglement is not allowed .
