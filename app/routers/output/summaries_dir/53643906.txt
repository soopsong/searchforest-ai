we present an in - depth study of the problem of discrimination of von neumann measurements in finite - dimensional hilbert spaces . specifically , we consider two scenarios : multiple - shot and unambiguous discrimination . in the case of multiple - shot discrimination , we focus on discrimination of measurements with the assistance of entanglement . interestingly , we prove that in this setting all pairs of distinct von neumann measurements can be distinguished perfectly ( i.e. with the unit success probability ) using only a finite number of queries . we also show that in this scenario queering the measurements in parallel gives the optimal strategy and hence any possible adaptive methods do not offer any advantage over the parallel scheme . in the second scenario we give the general expressions for the optimal discrimination probabilities with and without the assistance of entanglement . finally , we show that typical pairs of haar - random von neumann measurements can be perfectly distinguished with only two queries .
