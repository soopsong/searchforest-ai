the sensitivity properties of an su(1,1 ) interferometer made of two cascaded parametric amplifiers , as well as of an ordinary su(2 ) interferometer preceded by a squeezer and followed by an anti - squeezer , are theoretically investigated . several possible experimental configurations are considered , such as the absence or presence of a seed beam , direct or homodyne detection scheme . in all cases we formulate the optimal conditions to achieve phase super - sensitivity , meaning a sensitivity overcoming the shot - noise limit . we show that for a given gain of the first parametric amplifier , unbalancing the interferometer by increasing the gain of the second amplifier improves the interferometer properties . in particular , a broader super - sensitivity phase range and a better overall sensitivity can be achieved by gain unbalancing .
