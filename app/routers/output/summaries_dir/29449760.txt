we present a random walk model that exhibits asymptotic subdiffusive , diffusive , and superdiffusive behavior in different parameter regimes . this appears to be the first instance of a single random walk model leading to all three forms of behavior by simply changing parameter values . furthermore , the model offers the great advantage of analytic tractability . our model is non - markovian in that the next jump of the walker is ( probabilistically ) determined by the history of past jumps . it also has elements of intermittency in that one possibility at each step is that the walker does not move at all . this rich encompassing scenario arising from a single model provides useful insights into the source of different types of asymptotic behavior .
