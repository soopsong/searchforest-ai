detecting and quantifying quantum entanglement of a given unknown state poses problems that are fundamentally important for quantum information processing . surprisingly , no direct ( i.e. , without quantum tomography ) universal experimental implementation of a necessary and sufficient test of entanglement has been designed even for a general two - qubit state . here we propose an experimental method for detecting a collective universal witness , which is a necessary and sufficient test of two - photon polarization entanglement . it allows us to detect entanglement for any two - qubit mixed state and to establish tight upper and lower bounds on its amount . a different element of this method is the sequential character of its main components , which allows us to obtain relatively complicated information about quantum correlations with the help of simple linear - optical elements . as such , this proposal realizes a universal two - qubit entanglement test within the present state of the art of quantum optics . we show the optimality of our setup with respect to the minimal number of measured quantities .
