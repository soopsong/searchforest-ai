we provide an explicit example of a bell inequality with 3 settings and 2 outcomes per site for which the largest violation is not obtained by the maximally entangled state , even if its dimension is allowed to be arbitrarily large . this complements recent results by junge and palazuelos ( arxiv:1007.3042 ) who show , employing tools from operator space theory , that such inequalities do exist . our elementary example provides arguably the simplest setting in which it can be demonstrated that even an infinite supply of epr pairs is not the strongest possible nonlocal resource .
