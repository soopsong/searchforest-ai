quantum random - access look - up of a string of classical bits is a necessary ingredient in several important quantum algorithms . in some cases , the cost of such quantum random - access memory ( qram ) is the limiting factor in the implementation of the algorithm . in this paper we study the cost of fault - tolerantly implementing a qram . we construct generic families of circuits which function as a qram , and analyze their resource costs when embedded in a surface code .
