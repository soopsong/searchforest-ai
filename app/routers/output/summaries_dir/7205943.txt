numerical simulation results are presented which suggest that a class of non - adiabatic rapid passage sweeps first realized experimentally in 1991 should be capable of implementing a set of quantum gates that is universal for one - qubit unitary operations and whose elements operate with error probabilities per operation p<10^{-4 } . the sweeps are non - composite and generate controllable quantum interference effects which allow the one - qubit gates produced to operate non - adiabatically while maintaining high accuracy . the simulations suggest that the one - qubit gates produced by these sweeps show promise as possible elements of a fault - tolerant scheme for quantum computing .
