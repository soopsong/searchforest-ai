we show how the quantum fast fourier transform ( qfft ) can be made exact for arbitrary orders ( first for large primes ) . for most quantum algorithms only the quantum fourier transform of order $ 2^n$ is needed , and this can be done exactly . kitaev \cite{kitaev } showed how to approximate the fourier transform for any order . here we show how his construction can be made exact by using the technique known as ` ` amplitude amplification ' ' . although unlikely to be of any practical use , this construction e.g. allows to make shor 's discrete logarithm quantum algorithm exact . thus we have the first example of an exact non black box fast quantum algorithm , thereby giving more evidence that ` ` quantum ' ' need not be probabilistic . we also show that in a certain sense the family of circuits for the exact qfft is uniform . namely the parameters of the gates can be calculated efficiently .
