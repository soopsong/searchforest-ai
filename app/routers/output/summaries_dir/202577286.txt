a method to fabricate gaas microcavities using only a soft mask with an electrolithographic pattern in an inductively coupled plasma etching is presented . a careful characterization of the fabrication process pinpointing the main routes for a smooth device sidewall is discussed . using the final recipe , optomechanical microdisk resonators are fabricated . the results show a very high optical quality factors of $ q_\text{opt}>2\times 10^{5}$ , among the largest already reported for dry - etching devices . the final devices are also shown to present high mechanical quality factors and an optomechanical vacuum coupling constant of $ g_{0}=2\pi\times 13.6 $ khz enabling self - sustainable mechanical oscillations for an optical input power above $ 1 $ mw .
