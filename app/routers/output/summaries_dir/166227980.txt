the scenario of a single - mode cavity with harmonically modulated frequency is revisited in the presence of strongly detuned qubit or cyclic qutrit . it is found that when the qubit frequency is close to $ 3\nu $ there is a peak in the photon generation rate via four - photon transitions for the modulation frequency $ 4\nu $ , where $ \nu $ is the average cavity frequency . effective five - photon processes can occur for the modulation frequency $ 5\nu $ in the presence of a cyclic qutrit , and the corresponding transition rates exhibit series of peaks . closed analytical description is derived for the unitary evolution , and numeric simulations indicate the feasibility of multi - photon dynamical casimir effect under weak dissipation .
