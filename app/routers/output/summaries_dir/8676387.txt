a geometric perspective involving grammian and frame operators is used to derive the entire family of welch bounds . this perspective unifies a number of observations that have been made regarding tightness of the bounds and their connections to symmetric k - tensors , tight frames , homogeneous polynomials , and t - designs . in particular . a connection has been drawn between sampling of homogeneous polynomials and frames of symmetric k - tensors . it is also shown that tightness of the bounds requires tight frames . the lack of tight frames in symmetric k - tensors in many cases , however , leads to consideration of sets that come as close as possible to attaining the bounds . the geometric derivation is then extended in the setting of generalized or continuous frames . the welch bounds for finite sets and countably infinite sets become special cases of this general setting .
