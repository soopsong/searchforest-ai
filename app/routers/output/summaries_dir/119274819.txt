adiabatic processes driven by non - hermitian , time - dependent hamiltonians may be sped up by generalizing inverse engineering techniques based on berry 's transitionless driving algorithm or on dynamical invariants . we work out the basic theory and examples described by two - level hamiltonians : the acceleration of rapid adiabatic passage with a decaying excited level and of the dynamics of a classical particle on an expanding harmonic oscillator .
