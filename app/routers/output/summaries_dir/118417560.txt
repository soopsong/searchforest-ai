we propose an optical scheme to prepare large - scale entangled networks of w states . the scheme works by simultaneously fusing three polarization - encoded w states of arbitrary size via accessing only one qubit of each w state . it is composed of a fredkin gate ( controlled - swap gate ) , two fusion gates [ as proposed in new j. phys . 13 , 103003 ( 2011 ) ] and an h - polarized ancilla photon . starting with three $ n$-qubit w states , the scheme prepares a new w state with $ 3(n-1)$-qubits after postselection if both fusion gates operate successfully , i.e. a four - fold coincidence at the detectors . the proposed scheme reduces the cost of creating arbitrarily large w states considerably when compared to previously reported schemes .
