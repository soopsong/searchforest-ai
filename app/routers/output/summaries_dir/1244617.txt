the problem of converting noisy quantum correlations between two parties into noiseless classical ones using a limited amount of one - way classical communication is addressed . a single - letter formula for the optimal trade - off between the extracted common randomness and classical communication rate is obtained for the special case of classical - quantum correlations . the resulting curve is intimately related to the quantum compression with classical side information trade - off curve $ q^*(r)$ of hayden , jozsa and winter . for a general initial state we obtain a similar result , with a single - letter formula , when we impose a tensor product restriction on the measurements performed by the sender ; without this restriction the trade - off is given by the regularization of this function . of particular interest is a quantity we call ` ` distillable common randomness ' ' of a state : the maximum overhead of the common randomness over the one - way classical communication if the latter is unbounded . it is an operational measure of ( total ) correlation in a quantum state . for classical - quantum correlations it is given by the holevo mutual information of its associated ensemble , for pure states it is the entropy of entanglement . in general , it is given by an optimization problem over measurements and regularization ; for the case of separable states we show that this can be single - letterized .
