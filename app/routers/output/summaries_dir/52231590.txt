full quantum state tomography ( fqst ) plays a unique role in the estimation of the state of a quantum system without \emph{a priori } knowledge or assumptions . unfortunately , since fqst requires informationally ( over)complete measurements , both the number of measurement bases and the computational complexity of data processing suffer an exponential growth with the size of the quantum system . a 14-qubit entangled state has already been experimentally prepared in an ion trap , and the data processing capability for fqst of a 14-qubit state seems to be far away from practical applications . in this paper , the computational capability of fqst is pushed forward to reconstruct a 14-qubit state with a run time of only 3.35 hours using the linear regression estimation ( lre ) algorithm , even when informationally overcomplete pauli measurements are employed . the computational complexity of the lre algorithm is first reduced from $ o(10^{19})$ to $ o(10^{15})$ for a 14-qubit state , by dropping all the zero elements , and its computational efficiency is further sped up by fully exploiting the parallelism of the lre algorithm with parallel graphic processing unit ( gpu ) programming . our result can play an important role in quantum information technologies with large quantum systems .
