we quantitatively differentiate between the spreads of discrete - time quantum and classical random walks on a cyclic graph . due to the closed nature of any cyclic graph , there is additional"collision"- like interference in the quantum random walk along with the usual interference in any such walk on any graph , closed or otherwise . we find that the quantum walker remains localized in comparison to the classical one , even in the absence of disorder , a phenomenon that is potentially attributable to the additional interference in the quantum case . this is to be contrasted with the situation on open graphs , where the quantum walker , being effectively denied the collision - like interference , garners a much higher spread than its classical counterpart . we use shannon entropy of the position probability distribution to quantify spread of the walker in both quantum and classical cases . we find that for a given number of vertices on a cyclic graph , the entropy with respect to number of steps for the quantum walker saturates , on average , to a value lower than that for the corresponding classical one . we also analyze variations of the entropies with respect to system size , and look at the corresponding asymptotic growth rates .
