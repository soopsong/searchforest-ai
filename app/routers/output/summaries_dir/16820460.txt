we present a procedure that makes use of group theory to analyze and predict the main properties of the negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center in diamond . we focus on the relatively low temperatures limit where both the spin - spin and spin - orbit effects are important to consider . we demonstrate that group theory may be used to clarify several aspects of the nv structure , such as ordering of the singlets in the ( $ e^2 $ ) electronic configuration , the spin - spin and the spin - orbit interactions in the ( $ ae$ ) electronic configuration . we also discuss how the optical selection rules and the response of the center to electric field can be used for spin - photon entanglement schemes . our general formalism is applicable to a broad class of local defects in solids . the present results have important implications for applications in quantum information science and nanomagnetometry .
