we study the non - integrable dicke model , and its integrable approximation , the tavis - cummings model , as functions of both the coupling constant and the excitation energy . excited - state quantum phase transitions ( esqpt ) are found analyzing the density of states in the semi - classical limit and comparing it with numerical results for the quantum case in large hilbert spaces , taking advantage of efficient methods recently developed . two different esqpts are identified in both models , which are signaled as singularities in the semi - classical density of states , one { \em static } esqpt occurs for any coupling , whereas a dynamic esqpt is observed only in the superradiant phase . the role of the unstable fixed points of the hamiltonian semi - classical flux in the occurrence of the esqpts is discussed and determined . numerical evidence is provided that shows that the semi - classical result describes very well the tendency of the quantum energy spectrum for any coupling in both models . therefore the semi - classical density of states can be used to study the statistical properties of the fluctuation in the spectra , a study that is presented in a companion paper .
