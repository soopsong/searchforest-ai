in this article , we explore a new set of circuits , that incorporate both single - flux - quantum and quantized charge - based complementary quantum logic circuits . circuits that convert single - flux - quantum voltage pulses to quantized charge pulses and vice versa are introduced that lead to circuits that simplify logic and integration operations of individual flux and charge based logic circuits . these include fan - out circuits that enable single flux input to several charge outputs and control gate circuit with charge input controlling flux output . the operation of these circuits is demonstrated in simulations using wrspice . an xor gate implementation is presented as an example to illustrate the operation of these circuits . the developed complementary quantum logic circuits show promise for higher power efficiency and simpler design in the form of fewer junctions for a given logic implementation , leading to the possibility of higher integration density .
