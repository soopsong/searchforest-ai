we present two simple cryogenic rf ion trap systems in which cryogenic temperatures and ultra high vacuum pressures can be reached in as little as 12 hours . the ion traps are operated either in a liquid helium bath cryostat or in a low vibration closed cycle cryostat . the fast turn around time and availability of buffer gas cooling made the systems ideal for testing surface - electrode ion traps . the vibration amplitude of the closed cycled cryostat was found to be below 106 nm . we evaluated the systems by loading surface - electrode ion traps with $ ^{88}$sr$^+$ ions using laser ablation , which is compatible with the cryogenic environment . using doppler cooling we observed small ion crystals in which optically resolved ions have a trapped lifetime over 2500 minutes .
