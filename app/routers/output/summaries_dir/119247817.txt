a special feature of the ground state in a topologically ordered phase is the existence of large scale correlations depending only on the topology of the regions . these correlations can be detected by the topological entanglement entropy or by a measure called irreducible correlation . we show that these two measures coincide for states obeying an area law and having zero - correlation length . moreover , we provide an operational meaning for these measures by proving its equivalence to the optimal rate of a particular class of secret sharing protocols . this establishes an information - theoretical approach to multipartite correlations in topologically ordered systems .
