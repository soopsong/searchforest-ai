diabolical points , which originate from parameter - dependent accidental degeneracies of a system 's energy levels , have played a fundamental role in the discovery of the berry phase as well as in photonics ( conical refraction ) , in chemical dynamics , and more recently in novel materials such as graphene , whose electronic band structure possess dirac points . here we discuss diabolical points in an optomechanical system formed by multiple scatterers in an optical cavity with periodic boundary conditions . such configuration is close to experimental setups using micro - toroidal rings with indentations or near - field scatterers . we find that the optomechanical coupling is no longer an analytic function near the diabolical point and demonstrate the topological phase arising through the mechanical motion . similar to a fabry - perot resonator , the optomechanical coupling can grow with the number of scatterers . we also introduce a minimal quantum model of a diabolical point , which establishes a connection to the motion of an arbitrary - spin particle in a 2d parabolic quantum dot with spin - orbit coupling .
