four level quantum systems , known as quartits , and their relation to two- qubit systems are investigated group theoretically . following the spirit of klein 's lectures on the icosahedron and their relation to hopf sphere bra- tions , invariants of complex re ection groups occuring in the theory of qubits and quartits are displayed . then , real gates over octits leading to the weyl group of e8 and its invariants are derived . even multilevel systems are of interest in the context of solid state nuclear magnetic resonance .
