a method for diffracting the weak probe beam into unidirectional and higher - order directions is proposed via a novel rydberg electromagnetically induced grating , providing a new way for the implementations of quantum devices with cold rydberg atoms . the proposed scheme utilizes a suitable and position - dependent adjustment to the two - photon detuning besides the modulation of the standing - wave coupling field , bringing a in - phase modulation which can change the parity of the dispersion . we observe that when the modulation amplitude is appropriate , a perfect unidirectional diffraction grating can be realized . in addition , due to the mutual effect between the van der waals ( vdws ) interaction and the atom - field interaction length that deeply improves the dispersion of the medium , the probe energy can be counter - intuitively transferred into higher - order diffractions as increasing the vdws interaction , leading to the realization of a controllable higher - order diffraction grating via strong blockade .
