recently the complete characterization of a general gaussian dissipative system having a unique pure steady state was obtained in [ koga and yamamoto 2012 , phys . rev . a 85 , 022103 ] . this result provides a clear guideline for engineering an environment such that the dissipative system has a desired pure steady state such as a cluster state . in this paper , we describe the system in terms of a quantum stochastic differential equation ( qsde ) so that the environment channels can be explicitly dealt with . then a physical meaning of that characterization , which can not be seen without the qsde representation , is clarified ; more specifically , the nullifier dynamics of any gaussian system generating a unique pure steady state is passive . in addition , again based on the qsde framework , we provide a general and practical method to implement a desired dissipative gaussian system , which has a structure of quantum state transfer .
