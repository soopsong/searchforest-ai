we present a simple technique to reduce the emission rate of higher - order photon events from pulsed spontaneous parametric down - conversion . the technique uses extra - cavity control over a mode locked ultrafast laser to simultaneously increase repetition rate and reduce the energy of each pulse from the pump beam . we apply our scheme to a photonic quantum gate , showing improvements in the non - classical interference visibility for 2-photon and 4-photon experiments , and in the quantum - gate fidelity and entangled state production in the 2-photon case .
