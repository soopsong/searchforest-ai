we describe an ion - based cavity - qed system in which the internal dynamics of an atom is coupled to the modes of an optical cavity by vacuum - stimulated raman transitions . we observe raman spectra for different excitation polarizations and find quantitative agreement with theoretical simulations . residual motion of the ion introduces motional sidebands in the raman spectrum and leads to ion delocalization . the system offers prospects for cavity - assisted resolved - sideband ground - state cooling and coherent manipulation of ions and photons .
