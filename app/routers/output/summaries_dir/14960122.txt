we experimentally and theoretically investigate the dephasing rates of the coherent evolution of a resonantly driven pseudo spin emersed in a reservoir of pseudo spins . the pseudo spin is realized by optically exciting 87 rb atoms to a rydberg state . hence , the upper spin states are coupled via the strong van der waals interaction . two different experimental techniques to measure the dephasing rates are shown : the ' rotary echo ' technique known from nuclear magnetic resonance physics and electromagnetically induced transparency . the experiments are performed in a dense frozen rydberg gas , either confined in a magnetic trap or in an optical dipole trap . additionally , a numerical simulation is used to analyse the dephasing in the rotary echo experiments .
