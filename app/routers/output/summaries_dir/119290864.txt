we argue that the entanglement entropy offers us a useful coarse - grained entropy in time - dependent ads / cft . we show that the total von - neumann entropy remains vanishing even when a black hole is created in a gravity dual , being consistent with the fact that its corresponding cft is described by a time - dependent pure state . we analytically calculate the time evolution of entanglement entropy for a free dirac fermion on a circle following a quantum quench . this is interpreted as a toy holographic dual of black hole creations and annihilations . it is manifestly free from the black hole information problem .
