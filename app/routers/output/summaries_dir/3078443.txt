we consider the density matrices derived from combinatorial laplacian matrix of graphs . specifically , the star - relevant graph , which means adding certain edges on peripheral vertices of star graph , is the focus of this paper . initially , we provide the spectrum of the density matrices corresponding to star - like graph(i.e . , adding an edge on star graph ) and present that the von neumann entropy will increase under the graph operation(adding an edge on star graph ) and the graph operation can not simulated by local operation and classical communication ( locc ) . subsequently , we illustrate the spectrum of density matrices corresponding to star - alike graph(i.e , adding one edge on star - like graph ) and exhibit that the von neumann entropy will increase under the graph operation(adding an edge on star - like graph)and the graph operation can not simulated by locc . finally , the spectrum of density matrices corresponding to star - mlike graph(i.e . ,adding $ m$ nonadjacent edges on the peripheral vertices of star graph ) is demonstrated and the relation between the graph operation and von neumann entropy , locc is revealed in this paper .
