we study optomechanically induced transparency in a microresonator coupled with nanoparticles . by tuning the relative angle of the nanoparticles , exceptional points ( eps ) emerge periodically in this system and thus strongly modify both the transmission rate and the group delay of the signal . as a result , controllable slow - to - fast light switching can be achieved by manipulating external nanoparticles . this provides a new way to engineer ep - assisted optomechanical devices for applications in optical communications and signal processing .
