we formulate the problem of efficient transport of a quantum particle trapped in a harmonic potential which can move with a bounded velocity , as a minimum - time problem on a linear system with bounded input . we completely solve the corresponding optimal control problem and obtain an interesting bang - bang solution . these results are expected to find applications in quantum information processing , where quantum transport between the storage and processing units of a quantum computer is an essential step . they can also be extended to the efficient transport of bose - einstein condensates , where the ability to control them is crucial for their potential use as interferometric sensors .
