we study the dissipative dynamics and the formation of entangled states in driven cascaded quantum networks , where multiple systems are coupled to a common unidirectional bath . specifically , we identify the conditions under which emission and coherent reabsorption of radiation drives the whole network into a pure stationary state with non - trivial quantum correlations between the individual nodes . we illustrate this effect in more detail for the example of cascaded two - level systems , where we present an explicit preparation scheme that allows one to tune the whole network through"bright"and"dark"states associated with different multi - partite entanglement patterns . in a complementary setting consisting of cascaded non - linear cavities , we find that two cavity modes can be driven into a non - gaussian entangled dark state . potential realizations of such cascaded networks with optical and microwave photons are discussed .
