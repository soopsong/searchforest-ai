in this article , we discuss the implementation of a quantum recommendation system that uses a quantum variant of the k - nearest neighbours algorithm and the grover algorithm to search for a specific element in unstructured database . in addition to the presentation of the recommendation system as an algorithm , the article also shows a main steps in construction of a suitable quantum circuit for realisation of a given recommendation system . the computational complexity of individual calculation steps during recommendation system was also indicated . the verification correctness of a proposed recommendation system was also analysed , indicating an algebraic equation describing the probability of success of the recommendation . the article also shows numerical examples presenting the behaviour of the recommendation system for two selected cases .
