in this work , we introduce a new concatenation scheme which aims at protecting information against the occurrence of both computational errors and quantum erasures . according to our scheme , the internal code must be a quantum loss - correcting code that does not perform measurements , while the external code must be a quantum error - correcting code . we illustrate the concatenation proposed with an example in which one qubit of information is protected against the occurrence of two erasures and one computational error .
