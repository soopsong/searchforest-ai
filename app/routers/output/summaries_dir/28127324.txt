we analyze a proposed experiment [ boixo et al . , phys . rev . lett . 101 , 040403 ( 2008 ) ] for achieving sensitivity scaling better than $ 1 / n$ in a nonlinear ramsey interferometer that uses a two - mode bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of $ n$ atoms . we present numerical simulations that confirm the analytical predictions for the effect of the spreading of the bec ground - state wave function on the ideal $ 1 / n^{3/2}$ scaling . numerical integration of the coupled , time - dependent , two - mode gross - pitaevskii equations allows us to study the several simplifying assumptions made in the initial analytic study of the proposal and to explore when they can be justified . in particular , we find that the two modes share the same spatial wave function for a length of time that is sufficient to run the metrology scheme .
