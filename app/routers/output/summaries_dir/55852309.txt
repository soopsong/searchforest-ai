we present a multimode hamiltonian formulation for the problem of opto - acoustic interactions in optical waveguides . we establish a hamiltonian representation of the acoustic field and then introduce a full system with a simple opto - acoustic coupling that includes both photoelastic / electrostrictive and radiation pressure / moving boundary effects . the heisenberg equations of motion are used to obtain coupled mode equations for quantized envelope operators for the optical and acoustic fields . we show that the coupling coefficients obtained coincide with those established earlier , but our formalism provides a much simpler demonstration of the connection between radiation pressure and moving boundary effects than in previous work [ c. wolff et al , physical review a 92 , 013836 ( 2015 ) ] .
