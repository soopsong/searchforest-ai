we introduce a data bus , for reducing the qubit counts within quantum computations ( protected by surface codes ) . for general computations , an automated trade - off analysis ( software tool and source code are open sourced and available online ) is performed to determine to what degree qubit counts are reduced by the data bus : is the time penalty worth the qubit count reductions ? we provide two examples where the qubit counts are convincingly reduced : 1 ) interaction of two surface code patches on nisq machines with 28 and 68 qubits , and 2 ) very large - scale circuits with a structure similar to state - of - the - art quantum chemistry circuits . the data bus has the potential to transform all layers of the quantum computing stack ( e.g. , as envisioned by google , ibm , riggeti , intel ) , because it simplifies quantum computation layouts , hardware architectures and introduces lower qubits counts at the expense of a reasonable time penalty .
