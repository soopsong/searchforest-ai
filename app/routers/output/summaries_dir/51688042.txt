resonating valence bond ( rvb ) states are a class of entangled quantum many body wavefunctions with great significance in condensed matter physics . we propose a scheme to synthesize a family of rvb states using a cavity qed setup with two - level atoms ( with states $ \vert 0 \rangle$ and $ \vert 1 \rangle$ ) coupled to a common photon mode . in the lossy cavity limit , starting with an initial state of $ m$ atoms excited and $ n$ atoms in the ground state , we show that this setup can be configured as a stern gerlach experiment . a measurement of photon emission collapses the wavefunction of atoms onto an rvb state composed of resonating long - ranged singlets of the form $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[\vert 0 1 \rangle - \vert 1 0 \rangle]$. each emitted photon reduces the number of singlets by unity , replacing it with a pair of lone spins or ` spinons ' . as spinons are formed coherently in pairs , they are analogous to cooper pairs in a superconductor . to simulate pair fluctuations , we propose a protocol in which photons are allowed to escape the cavity undetected . this leads to a mixed quantum state with a fluctuating number of spinon pairs -- an inchoate superconductor . remarkably , in the limit of large system sizes , this protocol reveals an underlying quantum phase transition . upon tuning the initial spin polarization ( $ m - n$ ) , the emission exhibits a continuous transition from a dark state to a bright state . this is reflected in the spinon pair number distribution which can be tuned from sub - poissonian to super - poissonian regimes . this opens an exciting route to simulate rvb states and superconductivity .
