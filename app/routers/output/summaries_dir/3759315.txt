we develop a notion of predicate transformer and , in particular , the weakest precondition , appropriate for quantum computation . we show that there is a stone - type duality between the usual state - transformer semantics and the weakest precondition semantics . rather than trying to reduce quantum computation to probabilistic programming we develop a notion that is directly taken from concepts used in quantum computation . the proof that weakest preconditions exist for completely positive maps follows immediately from the kraus representation theorem . as an example we give the semantics of selinger 's language in terms of our weakest preconditions . we also cover some specific situations and exhibit an interesting link with stabilizers .
