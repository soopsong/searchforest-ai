we consider open quantum walks on a graph , and consider the random variables defined as the passage time and number of visits to a given point of the graph . we study in particular the probability that the passage time is finite , the expectation of that passage time , and the expectation of the number of visits , and discuss the notion of recurrence for open quantum walks . we also study exit times and exit probabilities from a finite domain , and use them to solve dirichlet problems and to determine harmonic measures . we consider in particular the case of irreducible open quantum walks . the results we obtain extend those for classical markov chains .
