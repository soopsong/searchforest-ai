a monochromatic laser pumping a parametric down conversion crystal generates frequency entangled photon pairs . we study this experimentally by addressing such frequency entangled photons at telecommunication wavelengths ( around 1550 nm ) with fiber optics components such as electro - optic phase modulators and narrow band frequency filters . the theory underlying our approach is developed by introducing the notion of frequency bin entanglement . our results show that the phase modulators address coherently up to eleven frequency bins , leading to an interference pattern which can violate a bell inequality adapted to our setup by more than five standard deviations .
