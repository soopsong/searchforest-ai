we consider the general wigner function for a particle confined to a finite interval and subject to dirichlet boundary conditions . we derive the boundary corrections to the"star - genvalue"equation and to the time evolution equation . these corrections can be cast in the form of a boundary potential contributing to the total hamiltonian which together with a subsidiary boundary condition is responsible for the discretization of the energy levels . we show that a completely analogous formulation ( in terms of boundary potentials ) is also possible in standard operator quantum mechanics and that the wigner and the operator formulations are also in one - to - one correspondence in the confined case . in particular , we extend baker 's converse construction to bounded systems . finally , we elaborate on the applications of the formalism to the subject of wigner trajectories , namely in the context of collision processes and quantum systems displaying chaotic behavior in the classical limit .
