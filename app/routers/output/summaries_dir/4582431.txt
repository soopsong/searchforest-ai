we study the sensitivity of phase estimation using a generic class of path - symmetric entangled states $ |\varphi\rangle|0\rangle+|0\rangle|\varphi\rangle$ , where an arbitrary state $ |\varphi\rangle$ occupies one of two modes in quantum superposition . this class of states includes the previously considered states , i.e. $ noon$ states and entangled coherent states , as special cases . with its generalization , we identify the practical limit of phase estimation under energy constraint that is characterized by the photon statistics of the component state $ |\varphi\rangle$. we first show that quantum cramer - rao bound ( qcrb ) can be lowered with super - poissonianity of the state $ |\varphi\rangle$. by introducing a component state of the form $ |\varphi\rangle=\sqrt{q}|1\rangle+\sqrt{1-q}|n\rangle$ , we particularly show that an arbitrarily small qcrb can be achieved even with a finite energy in an ideal situation . for practical measurement schemes , we consider a parity measurement and a full photon - counting method to obtain phase - sensitivity . without photon loss , the latter scheme employing any path - symmetric states $ |\varphi\rangle|0\rangle+|0\rangle|\varphi\rangle$ achieves the qcrb over the entire range $ [ 0,2\pi]$ of unknown phase shift $ \phi$ whereas the former does so in a certain confined range of $ \phi$. we find that the case of $ |\varphi\rangle=\sqrt{q}|1\rangle+\sqrt{1-q}|n\rangle$ provides the most robust resource against loss among the considered entangled states over the whole range of input energy . finally we also propose experimental schemes to generate these path - symmetric entangled states .
