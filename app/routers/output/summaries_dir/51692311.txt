to implement fault - tolerant quantum computation with continuous variables , the gottesman - kitaev - preskill ( gkp ) qubit has been recognized as an important technological element . however , it is still challenging to experimentally generate the gkp qubit with the required squeezing level , 14.8 db , of the existing fault - tolerant quantum computation . to reduce this requirement , we propose a high - threshold fault - tolerant quantum computation with gkp qubits using topologically protected measurement - based quantum computation with the surface code . by harnessing analog information contained in the gkp qubits , we apply analog quantum error correction to the surface code.furthermore , we develop a method to prevent the squeezing level from decreasing during the construction of the large scale cluster states for the topologically protected measurement based quantum computation . we numerically show that the required squeezing level can be relaxed to less than 10 db , which is within the reach of the current experimental technology . hence , this work can considerably alleviate this experimental requirement and take a step closer to the realization of large scale quantum computation .
