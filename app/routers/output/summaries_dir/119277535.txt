in the quantum - bayesian approach to quantum foundations , a quantum state is viewed as an expression of an agent 's personalist bayesian degrees of belief , or probabilities , concerning the results of measurements . these probabilities obey the usual probability rules as required by dutch - book coherence , but quantum mechanics imposes additional constraints upon them . in this paper , we explore the question of deriving the structure of quantum - state space from a set of assumptions in the spirit of quantum bayesianism . the starting point is the representation of quantum states induced by a symmetric informationally complete measurement or sic . in this representation , the born rule takes the form of a particularly simple modification of the law of total probability . we show how to derive key features of quantum - state space from ( i ) the requirement that the born rule arises as a simple modification of the law of total probability and ( ii ) a limited number of additional assumptions of a strong bayesian flavor .
