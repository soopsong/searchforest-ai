we study the time evolution of the entanglement entropy after quantum quenches in lifshitz free scalar theories , with the dynamical exponent $ z>1 $ , by using the correlator method . for quantum quenches we consider two types of time - dependent mass functions : end - critical - protocol ( ecp ) and cis - critical - protocol ( ccp ) . in both cases , at early times the entanglement entropy is independent of the subsystem size . after a critical time ( $ t_c$ ) , the entanglement entropy starts depending on the subsystem size significantly . this critical time $ t_c$ for $ z = 1 $ in the fast ecp and ccp has been explained well by the fast quasi - particle of the quasi - particle picture . however , we find that for $ z>1 $ this explanation does not work and $ t_c$ is delayed . we explain why $ t_c$ is delayed for $ z>1 $ based on the quasiparticle picture : in essence , it is due to the competition between the fast and slow quasiparticles . at late times , in the ecp , the entanglement entropy slowly increases while , in the ccp , it is oscillating with a well defined period by the final mass scale , independently of $ z$. we give an interpretation of this phenomena by the correlator method . as $ z$ increases , the entanglement entropy increases , which can be understood by long - range interactions due to $ z$.
