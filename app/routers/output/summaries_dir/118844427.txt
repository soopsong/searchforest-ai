we study the properties of a refined weak coupling limit that preserves complete positivity in order to describe non - markovian dynamics in the spin - boson model . with this tool , we show the system presents a rich and new non - markovian phenomenology . this implies a dynamical difference between entanglement and coherence : the latter undergoes revivals whereas the former not , despite the induced dynamics being fully incoherent . in addition , the evolution presents"quasieternal"non - markovianity , becoming non - divisible at any time period where the system evolves qualitatively . furthermore , the method allows for an exact derivation of a master equation that accounts for a reversible energy exchange between system and environment . specifically , this is obtained in the form of a time - dependent lamb shift term .
