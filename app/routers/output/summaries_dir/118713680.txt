various measures have been suggested recently for quantifying the coherence of a quantum state with respect to a given basis . we first use two of these , the l_1-norm and relative entropy measures , to investigate tradeoffs between the coherences of mutually unbiased bases . results include relations between coherence , uncertainty and purity ; tight general bounds restricting the coherences of mutually unbiased bases ; and an exact complementarity relation for qubit coherences . we further define the average coherence of a quantum state . for the l_1-norm measure this is related to a natural ' coherence radius ' for the state , and leads to a conjecture for an l_2-norm measure of coherence . for relative entropy the average coherence is determined by the difference between the von neumann entropy and the quantum subentropy of the state , and leads to upper bounds for the latter quantity . finally , we point out that the relative entropy of coherence is a special case of g - asymmetry , which immediately yields several operational interpretations in contexts as diverse as frame - alignment , quantum communication and metrology , and suggests generalising the property of quantum coherence to arbitrary groups of physical transformations .
