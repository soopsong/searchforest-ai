entanglement , and , in particular the entanglement spectrum , plays a major role in characterizing many - body quantum systems . while there has been a surge of theoretical works on the subject , no experimental measurement has been performed to date because of the lack of an implementable measurement scheme . here , we propose a measurement protocol to access the entanglement spectrum of many - body states in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices . our scheme effectively performs a ramsey spectroscopy of the entanglement hamiltonian and is based on the ability to produce several copies of the state under investigation together with the possibility to perform a global swap gate between two copies conditioned on the state of an auxiliary qubit . we show how the required conditional swap gate can be implemented with cold atoms , either by using rydberg interactions or coupling the atoms to a cavity mode . we illustrate these ideas on a simple ( extended ) bose - hubbard model where such a measurement protocol reveals topological features of the haldane phase .
