black hole complementarity was a consensus among string theorists for the interpretation of the information loss problem . however , recently some authors find inconsistency of black hole complementarity : large n rescaling and amps argument . according to amps , the horizon should be a firewall so that one can not penetrate there for consistency . there are some controversial discussions on the firewall . apart from these papers , the authors suggest an assertion using a semi - regular black hole model and we conclude that the firewall , if it exists , should affect to asymptotic observer . in addition , if any opinion does not consider the duplication experiment and the large n rescaling , then the argument is difficult to accept .
