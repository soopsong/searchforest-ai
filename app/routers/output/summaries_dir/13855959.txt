a detailed understanding of the population and coherence dynamics in optically driven individual emitters in solids and their signatures in ultrafast nonlinear - optical signals is of prime importance for their applications in future quantum and optical technologies . in a combined experimental and theoretical study on exciton complexes in single semiconductor quantum dots we reveal a detailed picture of the dynamics employing three - beam polarization - resolved four - wave mixing ( fwm ) micro - spectroscopy . the oscillatory dynamics of the fwm signals in the exciton - biexciton system is governed by the fine - structure splitting and the biexciton binding energy in an excellent quantitative agreement between measurement and analytical description . the analysis of the excitation conditions exhibits a dependence of the dynamics on the specific choice of polarization configuration , pulse areas and temporal ordering of driving fields . the interplay between the transitions in the four - level exciton system leads to rich evolution of coherence and population . using two - dimensional fwm spectroscopy we elucidate the exciton - biexciton coupling and identify neutral and charged exciton complexes in a single quantum dot . our investigations thus clearly reveal that fwm spectroscopy is a powerful tool to characterize spectral and dynamical properties of single quantum structures .
