we derive a hierarchy of continuous - variable multipartite entanglement conditions in terms of second - order moments of position and momentum operators that generalizes existing criteria . each condition corresponds to a convex optimization problem which , given the covariance matrix of the state , can be numerically solved in a straightforward way . the conditions are independent of partial transposition and thus are also able to detect bound entangled states . our approach can be used to obtain an analytical condition for genuine multipartite entanglement . we demonstrate that even a special case of our conditions can detect entanglement very efficiently . using multi - objective optimization it is also possible to numerically verify genuine entanglement of some experimentally realizable states .
