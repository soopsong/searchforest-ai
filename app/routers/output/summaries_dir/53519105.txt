we theoretically study the casimir - polder force on an atom in a arbitrary initial state in a rather general electromagnetic environment wherein the materials may have a nonreciprocal bianisotropic dispersive response . it is shown that under the markov approximation the force has resonant and nonresonant contributions . we obtain explicit expressions for the optical force both in terms of the system green function and of the electromagnetic modes . we apply the theory to the particular case wherein a two - level system interacts with a topological gyrotropic material , showing that the nonreciprocity enables exotic light - matter interactions and the opportunity to sculpt and tune the casimir - polder forces on the nanoscale . with a quasi - static approximation , we obtain a simple analytical expression for the optical force and unveil the crucial role of surface plasmons in fluctuation induced forces . finally , we derive the green function for a gyrotropic material half - space in terms of a sommerfeld integral .
