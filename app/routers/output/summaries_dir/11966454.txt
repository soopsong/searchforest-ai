to realize long - distance quantum communication and quantum network , it is required to have multiplexed quantum memory with many memory cells . each memory cell needs to be individually addressable and independently accessible . here we report an experiment that realizes a multiplexed dlcz - type quantum memory with 225 individually accessible memory cells in a macroscopic atomic ensemble . as a key element for quantum repeaters , we demonstrate that entanglement with flying optical qubits can be stored into any neighboring memory cells and read out after a programmable time with high fidelity . experimental realization of a multiplexed quantum memory with many individually accessible memory cells and programmable control of its addressing and readout makes an important step for its application in quantum information technology .
