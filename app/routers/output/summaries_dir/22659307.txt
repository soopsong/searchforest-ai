system identification is a key enabling component for the implementation of quantum technologies , including quantum control . in this paper , we consider the class of passive linear input - output systems , and investigate several basic questions : ( 1 ) which parameters can be identified ? ( 2 ) given sufficient input - output data , how do we reconstruct the system parameters ? ( 3 ) how can we optimize the estimation precision by preparing appropriate input states and performing measurements on the output ? we show that minimal systems can be identified up to a unitary transformation on the modes , and systems satisfying a hamiltonian connectivity condition called"infecting"are completely identifiable . we propose a frequency domain design based on a fisher information criterion , for optimizing the estimation precision for coherent input state . as a consequence of the unitarity of the transfer function , we show that the heisenberg limit with respect to the input energy can be achieved using non - classical input states .
