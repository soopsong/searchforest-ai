we propose to synthesize arbitrary nonclassical motional states in optomechanical systems by using sideband excitations and photon blockade . we first demonstrate that the hamiltonian of the optomechanical systems can be reduced , in the strong single - photon optomechanical coupling regime when the photon blockade occurs , to one describing the interaction between a driven two - level trapped ion and the vibrating modes , and then show a method to generate target states by using a series of classical pulses with desired frequencies , phases , and durations . we further analyze the effect of the photon leakage , due to small anharmonicity , on the fidelity of the expected motional state , and study environment induced decoherence . moreover , we also discuss the experimental feasibility and provide operational parameters using the possible experimental data .
