over the years , the so - called black hole information loss paradox has generated an amazingly diverse set of ( often radical ) proposals . however , forty years after the introduction of hawking 's radiation , there continues to be a debate regarding whether the effect does , in fact , lead to an actual problem . in this paper we try to clarify some aspect of the discussion by describing two possible perspectives regarding the landscape of the information loss issue . moreover , we advance a fairly conservative point of view regarding the relation between evaporating black holes and the rest of physics , which leads us to advocate a generalized breakdown of unitarity . we conclude by exploring some implications of our proposal in relation with conservation laws .
