a promising route to novel quantum technologies are hybrid quantum systems , which combine the advantages of several individual quantum systems . we have realized a hybrid atomic - mechanical experiment consisting of a sin membrane oscillator cryogenically precooled to 500 mk and optically coupled to a cloud of laser cooled rb atoms . here , we demonstrate active feedback cooling of the oscillator to a minimum mode occupation of n = 16 corresponding to a mode temperature of t = 200 { \mu}k . furthermore , we characterize in detail the coupling of the membrane to the atoms by means of sympathetic cooling . by simultaneously applying both cooling methods we demonstrate the possibility of preparing the oscillator near the motional ground state while it is coupled to the atoms . realistic modifications of our setup will enable the creation of a ground state hybrid quantum system , which opens the door for coherent quantum state transfer , teleportation and entanglement as well as quantum enhanced sensing applications .
