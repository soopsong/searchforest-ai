doubly polar molecules , possessing an electric dipole moment and a magnetic dipole moment , can strongly couple to both an external electric field and a magnetic field , providing unique opportunities to exert full control of the system quantum state at ultracold temperatures . we propose a method for creating a purely long - range doubly polar homonuclear molecule from a pair of strongly magnetic lanthanide atoms , one atom being in its ground level and the other in a superposition of quasi - degenerate opposite - parity excited levels [ phys.~rev.~lett.~\textbf{121 } , 063201 ( 2018 ) ] . the electric dipole moment is induced by coupling the excited levels with an external electric field . we derive the general expression of the long - range , stark , and zeeman interaction energies in the properly symmetrized and fully - coupled basis describing the diatomic complex . taking the example of holmium , our calculations predict shallow long - range wells in the potential energy curves that may support vibrational levels accessible by direct photoassociation from pairs of ground - level atoms .
