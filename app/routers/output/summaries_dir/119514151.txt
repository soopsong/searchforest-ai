in this paper we investigate the non - markovian dynamics of a qubit by comparing two generalized master equations with memory . in the case of a thermal bath , we derive the solution of the post - markovian master equation recently proposed in ref . [ a. shabani and d.a . lidar , phys . rev . a { \bf 71 } , 020101(r ) ( 2005 ) ] and we study the dynamics for an exponentially decaying memory kernel . we compare the solution of the post - markovian master equation with the solution of the typical memory kernel master equation . our results lead to a new physical interpretation of the reservoir correlation function and bring to light the limits of usability of master equations with memory for the system under consideration .
