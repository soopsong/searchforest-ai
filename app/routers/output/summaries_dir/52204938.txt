a protocol with the potential of beating the existing distance records for conventional quantum key distribution ( qkd ) systems is proposed . it borrows ideas from quantum repeaters by using memories in the middle of the link , and that of measurement - device - independent qkd , which only requires optical source equipment at the user 's end . for certain fast memories , our scheme allows a higher repetition rate than that of quantum repeaters , thereby requiring lower coherence times . by accounting for various sources of nonideality , such as memory decoherence , dark counts , misalignment errors , and background noise , as well as timing issues with memories , we develop a mathematical framework within which we can compare qkd systems with and without memories . in particular , we show that with the state - of - the - art technology for quantum memories , it is possible to devise memory - assisted qkd systems that , at certain distances of practical interest , outperform current qkd implementations .
