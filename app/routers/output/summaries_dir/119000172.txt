the most general structure ( in matrix form ) of a single - qubit gate is presented . subsequently , used that to obtain a set of conditions for testing ( a ) whether a given 2-qubit gate is genuinely a 2-qubit gate , i.e. , not decomposable into two single qubit gates and ( b ) whether a given single qubit gate is self - inverse ? relevance of the results reported here is discussed in the context of optimization of reversible and quantum circuits , especially for the optimization of quantum cost . a systematic procedure is developed for the identification of the non - decomposable 2-qubit gates . such a non - decomposable 2-qubit gate along with all possible single qubit gates form a universal quantum gate library . further , some possible applications of the present work are also discussed .
