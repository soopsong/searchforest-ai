solutions of the cauchy problem for the wave equation on a non - globally hyperbolic spacetime , which contains closed timelike curves ( time machines ) are considered . it is proved , that there exists a solution of the cauchy problem , it is discontinuous and in some sense unique for arbitrary initial conditions , which are given on a hypersurface at time , that precedes the formation of closed timelike curves ( ctc ) . if the hypersurface of initial conditions intersects the region containing ctc , then the solution of the cauchy problem exists only for such initial conditions , that satisfy a certain requirement of self - consistency .
