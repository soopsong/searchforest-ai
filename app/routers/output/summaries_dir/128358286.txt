we study time - minimum optimal control for a class of quantum two - dimensional dissipative systems whose dynamics are governed by the lindblad equation and where control inputs acts only in the hamiltonian . the dynamics of the control system are analyzed as a bi - linear control system on the bloch ball after a decoupling of such dynamics into intra- and inter - unitary orbits . the ( singular ) control problem consists of finding a trajectory of the state variables solving a radial equation in the minimum amount of time , starting at the completely mixed state and ending at the state with the maximum achievable purity . the boundary value problem determined by the time - minimum singular optimal control problem is studied numerically . if controls are unbounded , simulations show that multiple local minimal solutions might exist . to find the unique globally minimal solution , we must repeat the algorithm for various initial conditions and find the best solution out of all of the candidates . if controls are bounded , optimal controls are given by bang - bang controls using the pontryagin minimum principle . using a switching map we construct optimal solutions consisting of singular arcs . if controls are bounded , the analysis of our model also implies classical analysis done previously for this problem .
