this paper presents a model reduction method for the class of linear quantum stochastic systems often encountered in quantum optics and their related fields . the approach is proposed on the basis of an interpolatory projection ensuring that specific input - output responses of the original and the reduced - order systems are matched at multiple selected points ( or frequencies ) . importantly , the physical realizability property of the original quantum system imposed by the law of quantum mechanics is preserved under our tangential interpolatory projection . an error bound is established for the proposed model reduction method and an avenue to select interpolation points is proposed . a passivity preserving model reduction method is also presented . examples of both active and passive systems are provided to illustrate the merits of our proposed approach .
