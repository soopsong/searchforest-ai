we present a model for measurements of the scattering matrix elements of tunable microwave cavities in the presence of resonant frequency fluctuations induced by fluctuations in the tuning parameter . we apply this model to the specific case of a two - sided cavity and find an analytic expression for the average scattering matrix elements . a key signature of this ` fluctuating model ' is a subtle deformation of the trajectories swept out by scattering matrix elements in the complex plane . we apply this model to experimental data and report a direct observation of this deformation in the data . despite this signature , we show that the fluctuating and non - fluctuating models are qualitatively similar enough to be mistaken for one another , especially in the presence of measurement noise . however , if one applies the non - fluctuating model to data for which frequency fluctuations are significant then one will find damping rates that appear to depend on the tuning parameter , which is a common observation in tunable superconducting microwave cavities . we propose this model as both a potential explanation of and remedy to this apparent phenomenon .
