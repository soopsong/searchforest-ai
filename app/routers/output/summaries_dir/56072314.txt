we present a cold atom gravimeter operating with a sample of bose - condensed rubidium-87 atoms . using a mach - zehnder configuration with the two arms separated by a two - photon bragg transition , we observe interference fringes with a visibility of 83 % at t=3 ms . we exploit large momentum transfer ( lmt ) beam splitting to increase the enclosed space - time area of the interferometer using higher - order bragg transitions and bloch oscillations . we also compare fringes from condensed and thermal sources , and observe a reduced visibility of 58 % for the thermal source . we suspect the loss in visibility is caused partly by wavefront aberrations , to which the thermal source is more susceptible due to its larger transverse momentum spread . finally , we discuss briefly the potential advantages of using a coherent atomic source for lmt , and present a simple mean - field model to demonstrate that with currently available experimental parameters , interaction - induced dephasing will not limit the sensitivity of inertial measurements using freely - falling , coherent atomic sources .
