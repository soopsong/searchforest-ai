we theoretically investigate the spectral property of biphoton state from the cascade emissions from a doppler - broadened atomic ensemble . this biphoton state is spontaneously created in the four - wave - mixing process . the upper transition of the emissions lies in telecom bandwidth , which prevails in fiber - based quantum communication for low - loss transmission . we obtain the spectral property in terms of superradiant decay rates of the lower transition , excitation pulse durations , and temperature of the medium . we quantify their frequency entanglement by schmidt decomposition and find that more entangled source can be generated with longer excitation pulses , enhanced decay rates , and significant doppler broadening . a minimally entangled biphoton source can also be located at some optimal temperature of the atoms . this allows spectral shaping of continuous frequency entanglement , which is useful in multimode long - distance quantum communication .
