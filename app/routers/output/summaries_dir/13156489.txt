this paper extends applications of the quantum small gain and popov methods from existing results on robust stability to performance analysis results for a class of uncertain quantum systems . this class of systems involves a nominal linear quantum system and is subject to quadratic perturbations in the system hamiltonian . based on these two methods , coherent guaranteed cost controllers are designed for a given quantum system to achieve improved control performance . an illustrative example also shows that the quantum popov approach can obtain less conservative results than the quantum small gain approach for the same uncertain quantum system .
