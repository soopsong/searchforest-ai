quantum coherence is a key element in topical research on quantum resource theories and a primary facilitator for design and implementation of quantum technologies . however , the resourcefulness of quantum coherence is severely restricted by environmental noise , which is indicated by the loss of information in a quantum system , measured in terms of its purity . in this work , we derive the limits imposed by the mixedness of a quantum system on the amount of quantum coherence that it can possess . we obtain an analytical trade - off between the two quantities that upperbound the maximum quantum coherence for fixed mixedness in a system . this gives rise to a class of quantum states,"maximally coherent mixed states,"whose coherence can not be increased further under any purity - preserving operation . for the above class of states , quantum coherence and mixedness satisfy a complementarity relation , which is crucial to understand the interplay between a resource and noise in open quantum systems .
