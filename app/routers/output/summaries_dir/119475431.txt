we give a description of the continuous - variable teleportation protocol in terms of the characteristic functions of the quantum states involved . the braunstein -- kimble protocol is written for an unbalanced homodyne measurement and arbitrary input and resource states . we show that the output of the protocol is a superposition between the input one - mode field and a classical one induced by measurement and classical communication . we choose to describe the input state distortion through teleportation by the average photon number of the measurement - induced field . only in the case of symmetric resource states we find a relation between the optimal added noise and the minimal epr correlations used to define inseparability .
