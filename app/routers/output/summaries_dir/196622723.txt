we theoretically study the quantum interference induced photon blockade phenomenon in atom cavity qed system , where the destructive interference between two different transition pathways prohibits the two - photon excitation . here , we first explore the single atom cavity qed system via an atom or cavity drive . we show that the cavity - driven case will lead to the quantum interference induced photon blockade under a specific condition , but the atom driven case ca n't result in such interference induced photon blockade . then , we investigate the two atoms case , and find that an additional transition pathway appears in the atom - driven case . we show that this additional transition pathway results in the quantum interference induced photon blockade only if the atomic resonant frequency is different from the cavity mode frequency . moreover , in this case , the condition for realizing the interference induced photon blockade is independent of the system 's intrinsic parameters , which can be used to generate antibunched photon source both in weak and strong coupling regimes .
