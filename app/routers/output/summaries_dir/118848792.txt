a quantum anti - ferromagnetic spin-1 model is characterised on a 2d lattice with the following requirements : i ) the hamiltonian is made out of nearest neighbour interactions . ii ) it is homogeneous , translational and rotational invariant . iii ) the ground state is a real singlet state of su(2 ) ( non - chiral ) . iv ) it has a local spin-1 representation . along the way to characterise the system , connections with classical statistical mechanics and integrable models are explored . finally , the relevance of the model in the physics of low dimensional anti - ferromagnetic mott - hubbard insulators is discussed .
