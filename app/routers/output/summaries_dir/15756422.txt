we reconsider density matrices of graphs as defined in [ quant - ph/0406165 ] . the density matrix of a graph is the combinatorial laplacian of the graph normalized to have unit trace . we describe a simple combinatorial condition ( the"degree condition " ) to test separability of density matrices of graphs . the condition is directly related to the ppt - criterion . we prove that the degree condition is necessary for separability and we conjecture that it is also sufficient . we prove special cases of the conjecture involving nearest point graphs and perfect matchings . we observe that the degree condition appears to have value beyond density matrices of graphs . in fact , we point out that circulant density matrices and other matrices constructed from groups always satisfy the condition and indeed are separable with respect to any split . the paper isolates a number of problems and delineates further generalizations .
