most quantum - error correcting codes assume that the decoherence of each physical qubit is independent of the decoherence of any other physical qubit . we can test the validity of this assumption in an experimental setup where a microwave feedline couples to multiple qubits by examining correlations between the qubits . here , we investigate the correlations between fluxonium qubits located in a single waveguide . despite being in a wide - bandwidth electromagnetic environment , the qubits have measured relaxation times in excess of 100 us . we use cascaded josephson parametric amplifiers to measure the quantum jumps of two fluxonium qubits simultaneously . no correlations are observed between the relaxation times of the two fluxonium qubits , which indicates that the sources of relaxation are local to each qubit . our architecture can easily be scaled to monitor larger numbers of qubits .
