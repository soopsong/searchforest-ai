we investigate quantum - squeezing - enhanced weak - force sensing via a nonlinear optomechanical resonator containing a movable mechanical mirror and an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) . herein , we determined that tuning the opa parameters can considerably suppress quantum noise and substantially enhance force sensitivity , enabling the device to extensively surpass the standard quantum limit . this indicates that under realistic experimental conditions , we can achieve ultrahigh - precision quantum force sensing by harnessing nonlinear optomechanical devices .
