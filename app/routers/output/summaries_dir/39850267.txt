in this paper , by exploiting the weak measurement and quantum measurement re- versal ( wmqmr ) procedure , we propose a scheme to show how one can protect the geometric quantum discord ( gqd ) of a two - qutrit v - type atomic system each of which interacts with a dissipative reservoir independently . we examine the scheme for the gqd of the initial two - qutrit werner and horodecki states for different classes of weak mea- surement strengthes . it is found out that the presented protocol enables us to suppress decoherence due to the amplitude damping ( ad ) channel and preserve the quantum dis- cord of the two - qutrit system successfully .
