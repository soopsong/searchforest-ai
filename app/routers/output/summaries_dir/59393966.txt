we apply the $ ads / cft$ holography to the simplest possible eternal time machine solution in $ ads_3 $ based on two conical defects moving around their center of mass along a circular orbit . closed timelike curves in this space - time extend all the way to the boundary of $ ads_3 $ , violating causality of the boundary field theory . by use of the geodesic approximation we address the"grandfather paradox"in the dual $ 1 + 1 $ dimensional field theory and calculate the two - point retarded green function . it has a non - trivial analytical structure both at negative and positive times , providing us with an intuition on how an interacting quantum field could behave once causality is broken . in contrast with the previous considerations our calculations reveal the possibility of a consistent and controllable evolution of a quantum system without any need to impose additional consistency constraints .
