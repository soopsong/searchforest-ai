the quantum advantage of dense coding is studied , considering general encoding quantum operations . particular attention is devoted to the case of many senders , and it is shown that restrictions on the possible operations on the senders ' side may make some quantum state useless for dense - coding . it is shown , e.g. , that some states are useful for dense coding if the senders can communicate classically ( but not quantumly ) , yet they can not be used for dense coding , if classical communication is not allowed . these no - go results are actually independent of the particular quantification of the quantum advantage , being valid for any reasonable choice . it is further shown that the quantum advantage of dense coding satisfies a monogamy relation with the so - called entanglement of purification .
