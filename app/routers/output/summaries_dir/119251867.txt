vector spherical wavefunctions were derived in closed - form to represent time - harmonic electromagnetic fields in an orthorhombic dielectric - magnetic material with gyrotropic - like magnetoelectric properties . these wavefunctions were used to formulate the t matrix for scattering by a three - dimensional object composed of the chosen material . furthermore , a closed - form , coordinate - free expression of the dyadic green function for the chosen material was derived . expressions ascertained for the singularity behavior will be useful for formulating volume integral equations for scattering inside the chosen material . a bilinear expansion of the dyadic green function was obtained in terms of the derived vector spherical wavefunctions .
