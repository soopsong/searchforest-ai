we calculate the free - fall energy density of scalar fields semi - classically by employing the trace anomaly on a two - dimensional schwarzschild black hole with respect to various black hole states in order to clarify whether something special at the horizon happens or not . for the boulware state , the energy density at the horizon is always negative divergent , which is independent of initial free - fall positions . however , in the unruh state the initial free - fall position is responsible for the energy density at the horizon and there is a critical point to determine the sign of the energy density at the horizon . in particular , a huge negative energy density appears when the freely falling observer is dropped just near the horizon . for the hartle - hawking state , it may also be positive or negative depending on the initial free - fall position , but it is always finite . finally , we discuss physical consequences of these calculations .
