the eprb experiment with massive partcles can be formulated if one defines spin in a relativistic way . two versions are discussed : the one using the spin operator defined via the relativistic center - of - mass operator , and the one using the pauli - lubanski vector . both are shown to lead to the same prediction for the eprb experiment : the degree of violation of the bell inequality decreases with growing velocity of the epr pair of spin-1/2 particles . the phenomenon can be physically understood as a combined effect of the lorentz contraction and the moller shift of the relativistic center of mass . the effect is therefore stronger than standard relativistic phenomena such as the lorentz contraction or time dilatation . the fact that the bell inequality is in general less violated than in the nonrelativistic case will have to be taken into account in tests for eavesdropping if massive particles will be used for a key transfer .
