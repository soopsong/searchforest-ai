the bandstructure of bulk silicon has a six - fold valley degeneracy . strain in the si / sige quantum well system partially lifts the valley degeneracy , but the materials factors that set the splitting of the two lowest lying valleys are still under intense investigation . we propose a method for accurately determining the valley splitting in si / sige double quantum dots embedded into a superconducting microwave resonator . we show that low lying valley states in the double quantum dot energy level spectrum lead to readily observable features in the cavity transmission . these features generate a"fingerprint"of the microscopic energy level structure of a semiconductor double quantum dot , providing useful information on valley splittings and intervalley coupling rates .
