a fundamental concept of the quantum internet is quantum entanglement . in a quantum internet scenario where the legal users of the network have different priority levels or where a differentiation of entanglement availability between the users is a necessity , an entanglement availability service is essential . here we define the entanglement availability differentiation ( ead ) service for the quantum internet . in the proposed ead framework , the differentiation is either made in the amount of entanglement with respect to the relative entropy of entanglement associated with the legal users , or in the time domain with respect to the amount of time that is required to establish a maximally entangled system between the legal parties . the framework provides an efficient and easily - implementable solution for the differentiation of entanglement availability in experimental quantum networking scenarios .
