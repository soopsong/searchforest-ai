we review the basic idea behind resource theories , where we quantify quantum resources by specifying a restricted class of operations . this divides the state space into various sets , including states which are free ( because they can be created under the class of operations ) , and those which are a resource ( because they can not be ) . one can quantify the worth of the resource by the relative entropy distance to the set of free states , and under certain conditions , this is a unique measure which quantifies the rate of state to state transitions . the framework includes entanglement , asymmetry and purity theory . it also includes thermodynamics , which is a hybrid resource theory combining purity theory and asymmetry . another hybrid resource theory which merges purity theory and entanglement can be used to study quantumness of correlations and discord , and we present quantumness in this more general framework of resource theories .
