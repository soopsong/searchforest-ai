we study the time - dependence of quantum entanglement between two unruh - dewitt detectors , one at rest in a minkowski frame , the other non - uniformly accelerated in some specified way . the two detectors each couple to a scalar quantum field but do not interact directly . the primary challenge in problems involving non - uniformly accelerated detectors arises from the fact that an event horizon is absent and the unruh temperature is ill - defined . by numerical calculation we demonstrate that the correlators of the accelerated detector in the weak coupling limit behaves like those of an oscillator in a bath of time - varying"temperature"proportional to the instantaneous proper acceleration of the detector , with oscillatory modifications due to non - adiabatic effects . we find that in this setup the acceleration of the detector in effect slows down the disentanglement process in minkowski time due to the time dilation in that moving detector
