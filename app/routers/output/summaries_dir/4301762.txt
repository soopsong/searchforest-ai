in this work we derive the general conditions for obtaining nonreciprocity in multi - mode parametrically - coupled systems . the results can be applied to a broad variety of optical , microwave , and hybrid systems including recent electro- and opto - mechanical devices . in deriving these results , we use a graph - based methodology to derive the scattering matrix . this approach naturally expresses the terms in the scattering coefficients as separate graphs corresponding to distinct coupling paths between modes such that it is evident that nonreciprocity arises as a consequence of multi - path interference and dissipation in key ancillary modes . these concepts facilitate the construction of new devices in which several other characteristics might also be simultaneously optimized . as an example , we synthesize a novel three - mode unilateral amplifier design by use of graphs . finally , we analyze the isolation generated in a common parametric multi - mode system , the dc - squid .
