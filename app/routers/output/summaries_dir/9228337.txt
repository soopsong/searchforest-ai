we discuss the possibility of observing quantum nonlocality using the so - called mode entanglement , analyzing the differences between different types of particles in this context . we first discuss the role of coherent states in such experiments , and we comment on the existence of coherent states in nature . the discussion of coherent states naturally raises questions about the role of particle statistics in this problem . although the pauli exclusion principle precludes coherent states with a large number of fermionic particles , we find that a large number of fermionic coherent states , each containing at most one particle , can be used to achieve the same effect as a bosonic coherent state for the purposes of this problem . the discussion of superselection rules arises naturally in this context , because their applicability to a given situation prohibits the use of coherent states . this limitation particularly affects the scenario that we propose for detecting the mode entanglement of fermionic particles .
