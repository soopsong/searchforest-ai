a scheme of single - photon multi - port router is put forward by coupling two optomechanical cavities with waveguides . it is shown that the coupled two optomechanical cavities can exhibit photon blockade effect , which is generated from interference of three mode interaction . a single - photon travel along the system is calculated . the results show that the single photon can be controlled in the multi - port system because of the radiation pressure , which should be useful for constructing quantum network .
