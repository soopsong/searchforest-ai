we discuss conditional renyi and tsallis entropies for bipartite quantum systems of finite dimension . we investigate the relation between the positivity of conditional entropies and entanglement properties . it is in particular shown that any state having a negative conditional entropy with respect to any value of the entropic parameter is distillable since it violates the reduction criterion . moreover we show that the entanglement of werner states in odd dimensions can neither be detected by entropic criteria nor by any other spectral criterion .
