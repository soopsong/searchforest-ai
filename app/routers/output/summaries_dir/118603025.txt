subtracting photons from a two - mode squeezed state is a well - known method to increase entanglement . we analyse different strategies of local photon subtraction from a two - mode squeezed state in terms of entanglement gain and success probability . we develop a general framework that incorporates imperfections and losses in all stages of the process : before , during , and after subtraction . by combining all three effects into a single efficiency parameter , we provide analytical and numerical results for subtraction strategies using photon - number - resolving and threshold detectors . we compare the entanglement gain afforded by symmetric and asymmetric subtraction scenarios across the two modes . for a given amount of loss , we identify an optimised set of parameters , such as initial squeezing and subtraction beam splitter transmissivity , that maximise the entanglement gain rate . we identify regimes for which asymmetric subtraction of different fock states on the two modes outperforms symmetric strategies . in the lossless limit , subtracting a single photon from one mode always produces the highest entanglement gain rate . in the lossy case , the optimal strategy depends strongly on the losses on each mode individually , such that there is no general optimal strategy . rather , taking losses on each mode as the only input parameters , we can identify the optimal subtraction strategy and required beam splitter transmissivities and initial squeezing parameter . finally , we discuss the implications of our results for the distillation of continuous - variable quantum entanglement .
