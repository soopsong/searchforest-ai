we consider the problem of determining the unknown parameters of the hamiltonian of a network of spin 1/2 particles . in particular , we study experiments in which the system is driven by an externally applied electro - magnetic field and the expectation value of the total magnetization is measured . under appropriate assumptions , we prove that , if it is possible to prepare the system in a known initial state , the above experiment allows to identify the parameters of the hamiltonian . in the case where the initial state is itself an unknown parameter , we characterize all the pairs hamiltonian - initial state which give the same value of the magnetization for every form of the driving electro - magnetic field . the analysis is motivated by recent results on the isospectrality of hamiltonians describing magnetic molecules .
