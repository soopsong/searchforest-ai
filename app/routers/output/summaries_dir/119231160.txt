we study the nature of the energy transfer process within a pair of coupled two - level systems ( donor and acceptor ) subject to interactions with the surrounding environment . going beyond a standard weak - coupling approach , we derive a master equation within the polaron representation that allows for investigation of both weak and strong system - bath couplings , as well as reliable interpolation between these two limits . with this theory , we are then able to explore both coherent and incoherent regimes of energy transfer within the donor - acceptor pair . we elucidate how the degree of correlation in the donor and acceptor fluctuations , the donor - acceptor energy mismatch , and the range of the environment frequency distribution impact upon the energy transfer dynamics . in the resonant case ( no energy mismatch ) we describe in detail how a crossover from coherent to incoherent transfer dynamics occurs with increasing temperature [ a. nazir , phys . rev . lett . 103 , 146404 ( 2009 ) ] , and we also explore how fluctuation correlations are able to protect coherence in the energy transfer process . we show that a strict crossover criterion is harder to define when off - resonance , though we find qualitatively similar population dynamics to the resonant case with increasing temperature , while the amplitude of coherent population oscillations also becomes suppressed with growing site energy mismatch .
