two methods to change a quantum harmonic oscillator frequency without transitions in a finite time are described and compared . the first method , a transitionless - tracking algorithm , makes use of a generalized harmonic oscillator and a non - local potential . the second method , based on engineering an invariant of motion , only modifies the harmonic frequency in time , keeping the potential local at all times .
