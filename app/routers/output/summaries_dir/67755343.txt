we demonstrate the local control of up to eight two - level systems interacting strongly with a microwave cavity . following calibration , the frequency of each individual two - level system ( qubit ) is tunable without influencing the others . bringing the qubits one by one on resonance with the cavity , we observe the collective coupling strength of the qubit ensemble . the splitting scales up with the square root of the number of the qubits , being the hallmark of the tavis - cummings model . the local control circuitry causes a bypass shunting the resonator , and a fano interference in the microwave readout , whose contribution can be calibrated away to recover the pure cavity spectrum . the simulator 's attainable size of dressed states is limited by reduced signal visibility , and -if uncalibrated- by off - resonance shifts of sub - components . our work demonstrates control and readout of quantum coherent mesoscopic multi - qubit system of intermediate scale under conditions of noise .
