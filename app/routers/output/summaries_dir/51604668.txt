it is np - complete to find non - negative factors $ w$ and $ h$ with fixed rank $ r$ from a non - negative matrix $ x$ by minimizing $ \|x - wh^\top\|_f^2$. although the separability assumption ( all data points are in the conical hull of the extreme rows ) enables polynomial - time algorithms , the computational cost is not affordable for big data . this paper investigates how the power of quantum computation can be capitalized to solve the non - negative matrix factorization with the separability assumption ( snmf ) by devising a quantum algorithm based on the divide - and - conquer anchoring ( dca ) scheme . the design of quantum dca ( qdca ) is challenging . in the divide step , the random projections in dca is completed by a quantum algorithm for linear operations , which achieves the exponential speedup . we then devise a heuristic post - selection procedure which extracts the information of anchors stored in the quantum states efficiently . under a plausible assumption , qdca performs efficiently , achieves the quantum speedup , and is beneficial for high dimensional problems .
