the vast and growing number of publications in all disciplines of science can not be comprehended by a single human researcher . as a consequence , researchers have to specialize in narrow sub - disciplines , which makes it challenging to uncover scientific connections beyond the own field of research . thus access to structured knowledge from a large corpus of publications could help pushing the frontiers of science . here we demonstrate a method to build a semantic network from published scientific literature , which we call semnet . we use semnet to predict future trends in research and to inspire new , personalized and surprising seeds of ideas in science . we apply it in the discipline of quantum physics , which has seen an unprecedented growth of activity in recent years . in semnet , scientific knowledge is represented as an evolving network using the content of 750,000 scientific papers published since 1919 . the nodes of the network correspond to physical concepts , and links between two nodes are drawn when two physical concepts are concurrently studied in research articles . we identify influential and prize - winning research topics from the past inside semnet thus confirm that it stores useful semantic knowledge . we train a deep neural network using states of semnet of the past , to predict future developments in quantum physics research , and confirm high quality predictions using historic data . with the neural network and theoretical network tools we are able to suggest new , personalized , out - of - the - box ideas , by identifying pairs of concepts which have unique and extremal semantic network properties . finally , we consider possible future developments and implications of our findings .
