there is recent interest in determining energy costs of shortcuts to adiabaticity ( sta ) , but different definitions of"cost"have been used . we demonstrate the importance of taking into account the control system ( cs ) for a fair assessment of energy flows and consumptions . we model the energy consumption and power to transport an ion by a sta protocol in a multisegmented paul trap . the ion is driven by an externally controlled , moving harmonic oscillator . even if no net ion- energy is gained at destination , setting the time - dependent control parameters is a macroscopic operation that costs energy and results in energy dissipation for the short time scales implied by the intrinsically fast sta processes . the potential minimum is displaced by modulating the voltages on control ( dc ) electrodes . a secondary effect of the modulation , usually ignored as it does not affect the ion dynamics , is the time- dependent energy shift of the potential minimum . the non trivial part of the energy consumption is due to the electromotive forces to set the electrode voltages through the low - pass filters required to preserve the electronic noise from decohering the ion 's motion . the results for the macroscopic cs ( the paul trap ) are compared to the microscopic power and energy of the ion alone . similarities are found -and may be used quantitatively to minimize costs- only when the cs - dependent energy shift of the harmonic oscillator is included in the ion energy .
