we investigate a set of discrete - time quantum search algorithms on the n - dimensional hypercube following a proposal by shenvi , kempe and whaley . we show that there exists a whole class of quantum search algorithms in the symmetry reduced space which perform a search of a marked vertex in time of order $ \sqrt{n}$ where $ n = 2^n$ , the number of vertices . in analogy to grover 's algorithm , the spatial search is effectively facilitated through a rotation in a two - level sub - space of the full hilbert space . in the hypercube , these two - level systems are introduced through avoided crossings . we give estimates on the quantum states forming the 2-level sub - spaces at the avoided crossings and derive improved estimates on the search times .
