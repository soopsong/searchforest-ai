we present a method to identify the coupled , normal modes of a superconducting transmission - line with an embedded lumped element circuit . we evaluate the effective transmission - line non - linearities in the case of kerr - like josephson interactions in the circuit and in the case where the embedded circuit constitutes a qubit degree of freedom , which is rabi coupled to the field in the transmission - line . our theory quantitatively accounts for the very high and positive kerr non - linearities observed in a recent experiment [ m. reh\'ak et.al . , appl . phys . lett . 104 , 162604 ] , and we can evaluate the accomplishments of modified versions of the experimental circuit .
