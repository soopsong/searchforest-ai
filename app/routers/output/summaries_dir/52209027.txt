we theoretically study a strongly - driven optomechanical system which consists of a passive optical cavity and an active mechanical resonator . when the optomechanical coupling strength is varied , phase transitions , which are similar those observed in $ \mathcal{pt}$-symmetric systems , are observed . we show that the optical transmission can be controlled by changing the gain of the mechanical resonator and loss of the optical cavity mode . especially , we find that : ( i ) for balanced gain and loss , optical amplification and absorption can be tuned by changing the optomechanical coupling strength through a control field ; ( ii ) for unbalanced gain and loss , even with a tiny mechanical gain , both optomechanically - induced transparency and anomalous dispersion can be observed around a critical point , which exhibits an ultra - long group delay . the time delay $ \tau$ can be optimized by regulating the optomechanical coupling strength through the control field and improved up to several orders of magnitude ( $ \tau\sim2 $ $ \mathrm{ms}$ ) compared to that of conventional optomechanical systems ( $ \tau\sim1 $ $ \mu\mathrm{s}$ ) . the presence of mechanical gain makes the group delay more robust to environmental perturbations . our proposal provides a powerful platform to control light transport using a $ \mathcal{pt}$-symmetric - like optomechanical system .
