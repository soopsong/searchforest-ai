given a fixed sigma - finite measure space $ \left(x,\mathscr{b},\nu\right)$ , we shall study an associated family of positive definite kernels $ k$. their factorizations will be studied with view to their role as covariance kernels of a variety of stochastic processes . in the interesting cases , the given measure $ \nu$ is infinite , but sigma - finite . we introduce such positive definite kernels $ k\left(\cdot,\cdot\right)$ with the two variables from the subset of the sigma - algebra $ \mathscr{b}$ , sets having finite $ \nu$ measure . our setting and results are motivated by applications . the latter are covered in the second half of the paper . we first make precise the notions of realizations and factorizations for $ k$ ; and we give necessary and sufficient conditions for $ k$ to have realizations and factorizations in $ l^{2}\left(\nu\right)$. tools in the proofs rely on probability theory and on spectral theory for unbounded operators in hilbert space . applications discussed here include the study of reversible markov processes , and realizations of gaussian fields , and their ito - integrals .
