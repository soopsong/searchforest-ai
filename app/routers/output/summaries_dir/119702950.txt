we introduce a continuous family of frustration - free hamiltonians with exactly solvable ground states . we prove that the { ground state of our model is non - degenerate and exhibits } a novel quantum phase transition from bounded entanglement entropy to a massively entangled state with volume entropy scaling . the ground state may be interpreted as a deformation away from the uniform superposition of colored motzkin paths , showed by movassagh and shor to have a large ( square - root ) but sub - extensive scaling of entanglement into a state with an extensive entropy .
