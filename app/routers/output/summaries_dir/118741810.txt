we present a method to test quantum behavior of quantum information processing devices , such as quantum memories , teleportation devices , channels and quantum key distribution protocols . the test of quantum behavior can be phrased as the verification of effective entanglement . necessary separability criteria are formulated in terms of a matrix of expectation values in conjunction with the partial transposition map . our method is designed to reduce the resources for entanglement verification . a particular protocol based on coherent states and homodyne detection is used to illustrate the method . a possible test for the quantum nature of memories using two non - orthogonal signal states arises naturally . furthermore , closer inspection of the measurement process in terms of the stokes operators reveals a security threat for quantum key distribution involving phase reference beams .
