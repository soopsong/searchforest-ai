given a classical channel , a stochastic map from inputs to outputs , can we replace the input with a simple intermediate variable that still yields the correct conditional output distribution ? we examine two cases : first , when the intermediate variable is classical ; second , when the intermediate variable is quantum . we show that the quantum variable 's size is generically smaller than the classical , according to two different measures --- cardinality and entropy . we demonstrate optimality conditions for a special case . we end with several related results : a proposal for extending the special case , a demonstration of the impact of quantum phases , and a case study concerning pure versus mixed states .
