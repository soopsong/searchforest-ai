the entropic uncertainty relation ( eur ) is of significant importance in the security proof of continuous - variable quantum key distribution under coherent attacks . the parameter estimation in the eur method contains the estimation of the covariance matrix ( cm ) , as well as the max - entropy . the discussions in previous works have not involved the effect of finite - size on estimating the cm , which will further affect the estimation of leakage information . in this work , we address this issue by adapting the parameter estimation technique to the eur analysis method under composable security frameworks . we also use the double - data modulation method to improve the parameter estimation step , where all the states can be exploited for both parameter estimation and key generation ; thus , the statistical fluctuation of estimating the max - entropy disappears . the result shows that the adapted method can effectively estimate parameters in eur analysis . moreover , the double - data modulation method can , to a large extent , save the key consumption , which further improves the performance in practical implementations of the eur .
