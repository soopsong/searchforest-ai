we present an experimental study of dynamical back - action cooling of the fundamental vibrational mode of a thin semitransparent membrane placed within a high - finesse optical cavity . we study how the radiation pressure interaction modifies the mechanical response of the vibrational mode , and the experimental results are in agreement with a langevin equation description of the coupled dynamics . the experiments are carried out in the resolved sideband regime , and we have observed cooling by a factor 350 we have also observed the mechanical frequency shift associated with the quadratic term in the expansion of the cavity mode frequency versus the effective membrane position , which is typically negligible in other cavity optomechanical devices .
