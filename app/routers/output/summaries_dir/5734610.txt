we implement an ultrafast pulsed type - ii parametric down conversion source in a periodically poled ktp waveguide at telecommunication wavelengths with almost identical properties between signal and idler . as such , our source resembles closely a pure , genuine single mode photon pair source with indistinguishable modes . we measure the joint spectral intensity distribution and second order correlation functions of the marginal beams and find with both methods very low effective mode numbers corresponding to a schmidt number below 1.16 . we further demonstrate the indistinguishability as well as the purity of signal and idler photons by hong - ou - mandel interferences between signal and idler and between signal / idler and a coherent field , respectively . without using narrowband spectral filtering , we achieve a visibility for the interference between signal and idler of 94.8 % and determine a purity of more than 80 % for the heralded single photon states . moreover , we measure raw heralding efficiencies of 20.5 % and 15.5 % for the signal and idler beams corresponding to detector - loss corrected values of 80 % and 70 % .
