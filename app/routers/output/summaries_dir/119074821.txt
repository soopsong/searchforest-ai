we propose a hybrid quantum system , where an $ lc$ resonator inductively interacts with a flux qubit and is capacitively coupled to a rydberg atom . varying the external magnetic flux bias controls the flux - qubit flipping and the flux qubit - resonator interface . the atomic spectrum is tuned via an electrostatic field , manipulating the qubit - state transition of atom and the atom - resonator coupling . different types of entanglement of superconducting , photonic , and atomic qubits can be prepared via simply tuning the flux bias and electrostatic field , leading to the implementation of three - qubit toffoli logic gate .
