we study the non - equilibrium steady state arising from the interplay between coherent and dissipative dynamics in strongly interacting rydberg gases using a recently introduced variational method [ h. weimer , phys . rev . lett . 114 , 040402 ( 2015 ) ] . we give a detailed discussion of the properties of this novel approach , and we provide a comparison with methods related to the bogoliubov - born - green - kirkwood - yvon hierarchy . we find that the variational approach offers some intrinsic advantages , and we also show that it is able to explain the experimental results obtained in an ultracold rydberg gas on an unprecedented quantitative level .
