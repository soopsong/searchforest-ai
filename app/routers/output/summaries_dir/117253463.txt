we investigate the properties of the optical output fields from a cavity optomechanical system , where the cavity is driven by a strong coupling and a weak probe optical fields and the mechanical resonator is driven by a coherent mechanical pump . when the frequency of the mechanical pump matches the frequency difference between the coupling and probe optical fields , due to the interference between the different optical components at the same frequency , we demonstrate that the large positive or negative group delay of the output field at the frequency of probe field can be achieved and tuned by adjusting the phase and amplitude of the mechanical driving field . moreover , the strength of the output field at the frequency of optical four - wave - mixing ( fwm ) field also can be controlled ( enhanced and suppressed ) by tuning the phase and amplitude of the mechanical pump . we show that the power of the output field at the frequency of the optical fwm field can be suppressed to zero or enhanced so much that it can be comparable with and even larger than the power of the input probe optical field .
