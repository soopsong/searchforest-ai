we suggest a scheme that allows arbitrarily perfect state transfer even in the presence of random fluctuations in the couplings of a quantum chain . the scheme performs well for both spatially correlated and uncorrelated fluctuations if they are relatively weak ( say 5 % ) . furthermore , we show that given a quite arbitrary pair of quantum chains , one can check whether it is capable of perfect transfer by only local operations at the ends of the chains , and the system in the middle being a"black box " . we argue that unless some specific symmetries are present in the system , it will be capable of perfect transfer when used with dual - rail encoding . therefore our scheme puts minimal demand not only on the control of the chains when using them , but also on the design when building them .
