how self - loops on vertices affect quantum walks is an interesting issue , and self - loops play important roles in quantum walk based algorithms . however , the original model that adjusting the effect of self - loops by changing their number has limitations . for example , the effect of self - loops can not be adjusted continuously , for their number must be an integer . in this paper , we proposed a model of adjustable self - loop on discrete - time quantum walk , whose weight is controlled by a real parameter in the coin operator . the proposed method not only generalises the situations where the number of self - loops is an integer , but also provides a way to adjust the weight of the self - loop continuously . it enhances the potential of self - loops in applications . for instance , we improve the success rate of the quantum walk based search on a $ 20\times20 $ two - dimension lattice from $ 23.6\%$ to $ 97.2\%$ by the proposed method . and the success rate of the improved search , which only scales as $ o(1/\log{n})$ before being improved , even increases slightly with the size of the lattice . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that such an improvement is achieved on the quantum walk based spatial search .
