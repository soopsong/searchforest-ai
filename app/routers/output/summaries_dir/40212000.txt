it is known that if the dimension is a perfect square the clifford group can be represented by monomial matrices . another way of expressing this result is to say that when the dimension is a perfect square the standard representation of the clifford group has a system of imprimitivity consisting of one dimensional subspaces . we generalize this result to the case of an arbitrary dimension . let k be the square - free part of the dimension . then we show that the standard representation of the clifford group has a system of imprimitivity consisting of k - dimensional subspaces . to illustrate the use of this result we apply it to the calculation of sic - povms ( symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measures ) , constructing exact solutions in dimensions 8 ( hand - calculation ) as well as 12 and 28 ( machine - calculation ) .
