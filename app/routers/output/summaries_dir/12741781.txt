we derive an expression for the mean square displacement of a particle whose motion is governed by a uniform , periodic , quantum multi - baker map . the expression is a function of both time , $ t$ , and planck 's constant , $ \hbar$ , and allows a study of both the long time , $ t\to\infty$ , and semi - classical , $ \hbar\to 0 $ , limits taken in either order . we evaluate the expression using random matrix theory as well as numerically , and observe good agreement between both sets of results . the long time limit shows that particle transport is generically ballistic , for any fixed value of planck 's constant . however , for fixed times , the semi - classical limit leads to diffusion . the mean square displacement for non - zero planck 's constant , and finite time , exhibits a crossover from diffusive to ballistic motion , with crossover time on the order of the inverse of planck 's constant . we argue , that these results are generic for a large class of 1d quantum random walks , similar to the quantum multi - baker , and that a sufficient condition for diffusion in the semi - classical limit is classically chaotic dynamics in each cell . some connections between our work and the other literature on quantum random walks are discussed . these walks are of some interest in the theory of quantum computation .
