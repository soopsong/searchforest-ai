the boundary beta function generates the renormalization group acting on the universality classes of one - dimensional quantum systems with boundary which are critical in the bulk but not critical at the boundary . we prove a gradient formula for the boundary beta function , expressing it as the gradient of the boundary entropy s at fixed nonzero temperature . the gradient formula implies that s decreases under renormalization , except at critical points ( where it stays constant ) . at a critical point , the number exp((s ) is the " ground - state degeneracy , " g , of affleck and ludwig , so we have proved their long - standing conjecture that g decreases under renormalization , from critical point to critical point . the gradient formula also implies that s decreases with temperature , except at critical points , where it is independent of temperature . it remains open whether the boundary entropy is always bounded below .
