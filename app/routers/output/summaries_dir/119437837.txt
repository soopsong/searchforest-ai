cavity optomechanical systems are one of the leading experimental platforms for controlling mechanical motion in the quantum regime . we exemplify that the control over cavity optomechanical systems greatly increases by coupling the cavity also to a two - level system , thereby creating a hybrid optomechanical system . if the two - level system can be driven largely independently of the cavity , we show that the non - linearity thus introduced enables us to steer the extended system to non - classical target states of the mechanical oscillator with wigner functions exhibiting significant negative regions . we illustrate how to use optimal control techniques beyond the linear regime to drive the hybrid system from the near ground state into a fock target state of the mechanical oscillator . we base our numerical optimization on realistic experimental parameters for exemplifying how optimal control enables the preparation of decidedly non - classical target states , where naive control schemes fail . our results thus pave the way for applying the toolbox of optimal control in hybrid optomechanical systems for generating non - classical mechanical states .
