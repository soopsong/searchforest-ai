optical properties and sensing capabilities of fused silica microbubbles were studied numerically using a finite element method . mode characteristics , such as quality factor ( q ) and effective refractive index , were determined for different bubble diameters and shell thicknesses . for sensing applications with whispering gallery modes ( wgms ) , thinner shells yield improved sensitivity . however , the q - factor decreases with reduced thickness and this limits the final resolution . three types of sensing applications with microbubbles , based on their optimized geometrical parameters , were studied . herein the so - called quasi - droplet regime is defined and discussed . it is shown that best resolution can be achieved when microbubbles act as quasi - droplets , even for water - filled cavities at the telecommunications c - band .
