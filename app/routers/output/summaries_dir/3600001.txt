it has been shown that classes of ( minimal asymmetric ) informationally complete povms in dimension d can be built using the multiparticle pauli group acting on appropriate fiducial states [ m. planat and z. gedik , r. soc . open sci . 4 , 170387 ( 2017 ) ] . the latter states may also be derived starting from the poincar\'e upper half - plane model h. for doing this , one translates the congruence ( or non - congruence ) subgroups of index d of the modular group into groups of permutation gates whose some of the eigenstates are the seeked fiducials . the structure of some ic - povms is found to be intimately related to the kochen - specker theorem .
