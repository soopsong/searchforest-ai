the design and implementation of quantum technologies necessitates the understanding of thermodynamic processes in the quantum domain . in stark contrast to macroscopic thermodynamics , at the quantum scale processes generically operate far from equilibrium and are governed by fluctuations . thus , experimental insight and empirical findings are indispensable in developing a comprehensive framework . to this end , we theoretically propose an experimentally realistic quantum engine that uses transmon qubits as working substance . we solve the dynamics analytically and calculate its efficiency .
