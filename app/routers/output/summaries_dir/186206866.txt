the vibronic dynamics of a trapped ion in the resolved - sideband regime can be described by the explicitly time - dependent nonlinear jaynes - cummings model . it is shown that the expectation value of the interaction hamiltonian and its non - equal - time commutator can be determined by measuring the electronic - state evolution . this yields direct insight into the time - ordering contributions to the unitary time evolution . in order to prove extraction of the quantities of interest works for possibly real data , we demonstrate the procedure by means of generated data .
