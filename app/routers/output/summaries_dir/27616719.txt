we study the separability of bipartite quantum systems in arbitrary dimensions using the bloch representation of their density matrix . this approach enables us to find an alternative characterization of the separability problem , from which we derive a necessary condition and sufficient conditions for separability . for a certain class of states the necessary condition and a sufficient condition turn out to be equivalent , therefore yielding a necessary and sufficient condition . the proofs of the sufficient conditions are constructive , thus providing decompositions in pure product states for the states that satisfy them . we provide examples that show the ability of these conditions to detect entanglement . in particular , the necessary condition is proved to be strong enough to detect bound entangled states .
