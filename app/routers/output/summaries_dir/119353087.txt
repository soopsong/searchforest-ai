it is argued that a weak value of an observable is a robust property of a single pre- and post - selected quantum system rather than a statistical property . during an infinitesimal time a system with a given weak value affects other systems as if it were in an eigenstate with eigenvalue equal to the weak value . this differs significantly from the action of a system pre - selected only and possessing a numerically equal expectation value . the weak value has a physical meaning beyond a conditional average of a pointer in the weak measurement procedure . the difference between the weak value and the expectation value has been demonstrated on the example of photon polarization . in addition , the weak values for systems pre- and post - selected in mixed states are considered .
