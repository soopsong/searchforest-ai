controlling and swapping quantum information in a quantum coherent way between the microwave and optical regimes is essential for building long - range superconducting quantum networks but extremely challenging . we propose a hybrid quantum interface between the microwave and optical domains where the propagation of a single - photon pulse along a nanowaveguide is controlled in a coherent way by tuning electromagnetically induced transparency window with the quantum state of a flux qubit . the qubit can route a single - photon pulse with a single spin in nanodiamond into a quantum superposition of paths without the aid of an optical cavity - simplifying the setup . by preparing the flux qubit in a superposition state our cavity - less scheme creates a hybrid state - path entanglement between a flying single optical photon and a static superconducting qubit , and can conduct heralded quantum state transfer via measurement .
