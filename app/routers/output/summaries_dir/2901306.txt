quantum parameter estimation is central to many fields such as quantum computation , communications and metrology . optimal estimation theory has been instrumental in achieving the best accuracy in quantum parameter estimation , which is possible when we have very precise knowledge of and control over the model . however , uncertainties in key parameters underlying the system are unavoidable and may impact the quality of the estimate . we show here how quantum optical phase estimation of a squeezed state of light exhibits improvement when using a robust fixed - interval smoother designed with uncertainties explicitly introduced in parameters underlying the phase noise .
