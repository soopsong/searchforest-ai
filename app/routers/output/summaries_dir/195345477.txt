in this letter we present a new quantity that shows whether two general qubit systems are entangled , which we call harmony . it captures the notion of separability and maximal entanglement . it is also shown that harmony is monogamous for 3-qubit states . thus , harmony serves as a new entanglement measure . in addition , since it is written as a simple function of the density operator , it is in practice easier to compute than other previously known measures .
