under a general framework , shortcuts to adiabatic processes are shown to be possible in classical systems . we then study the distribution function of the work done on a small system initially prepared at thermal equilibrium . it is found that the work fluctuations can be significantly reduced via shortcuts to adiabatic processes . for example , in the classical case probabilities of having very large or almost zero work values are suppressed . in the quantum case negative work may be totally removed from the otherwise non - positive - definite work values . we also apply our findings to a micro otto - cycle - based heat engine . it is shown that the use of shortcuts , which directly enhances the engine output power , can also increase the heat engine efficiency substantially , in both quantum and classical regimes .
