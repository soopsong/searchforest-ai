scattering in 3 + 1-dimensional qed is believed to give rise to transitions between different photon vacua . we show that these transitions can be removed by taking into account off - shell modes which correspond to li\'enard - wiechert fields of asymptotic states . this makes it possible to formulate scattering in 3 + 1-dimensional qed on a hilbert space which furnishes a single representation of the canonical commutation relations ( ccr ) . different qed selection sectors correspond to inequivalent representations of the photon ccr and are stable under the action of an ir finite , unitary s - matrix . infrared divergences are cancelled by ir radiation . using this formalism , we discuss the time - dependence of decoherence and phases of out - going density matrix elements in the presence of classical currents . the results demonstrate that although no information about a scattering process is stored in strictly zero - energy modes of the photon field , entanglement between charged matter and low energy modes increases over time .
