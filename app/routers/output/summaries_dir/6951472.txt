this paper extends previous results on constructing a direct coupling quantum observer for a quantum harmonic oscillator system . in this case , we consider a complex linear quantum system plant consisting of a network of quantum harmonic oscillators . conditions are given for which there exists a direct coupling observer which estimates a collection of variables in the quantum plant . it is shown that the order of the observer can be the same as the number of variables to be estimated when this number is even and thus this is a reduced order observer .
