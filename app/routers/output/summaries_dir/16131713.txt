the extended exotic planar model for a charged particle is constructed . it includes a chern - simons - like term for a dynamical electric field , but produces usual equations of motion for the particle in background constant uniform electric and magnetic fields . the electric chern - simons term is responsible for the non - commutativity of the boost generators in the ten - dimensional enlarged exotic galilei symmetry algebra of the extended system . the model admits two reduction schemes by the integrals of motion , one of which reproduces the usual formulation for the charged particle in external constant electric and magnetic fields with associated field - deformed galilei symmetry , whose commuting boost generators are identified with the nonlocal in time noether charges reduced on - shell . another reduction scheme , in which electric field transmutes into the commuting space translation generators , extracts from the model a free particle on the noncommutative plane described by the two - fold centrally extended galilei group of the non - relativistic anyons .
