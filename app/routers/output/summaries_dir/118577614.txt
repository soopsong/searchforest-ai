it is commonly stated that decoherence in open quantum systems is due to growing entanglement with an environment . in practice , however , surprisingly often decoherence may equally well be described by random unitary dynamics without invoking a quantum environment at all . for a single qubit , for instance , pure decoherence ( or phase damping ) is always of random unitary type . here , we construct a simple example of true quantum decoherence of two qubits : we present a feasible phase damping channel of which we show that it can not be understood in terms of random unitary dynamics . we give a very intuitive geometrical measure for the positive distance of our channel to the convex set of random unitary channels and find remarkable agreement with the so - called birkhoff defect based on the norm of complete boundedness .
