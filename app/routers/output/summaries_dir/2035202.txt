in this paper we describe a quantum algorithm to solve sparse systems of nonlinear differential equations whose nonlinear terms are polynomials . the algorithm is nondeterministic and its expected resource requirements are polylogarithmic in the number of variables and exponential in the integration time . the best classical algorithm runs in a time scaling linearly with the number of variables , so this provides an exponential improvement . the algorithm is built on two subroutines : ( i ) a quantum algorithm to implement a nonlinear transformation of the probability amplitudes of an unknown quantum state ; and ( ii ) a quantum implementation of euler 's method .
