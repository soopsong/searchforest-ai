a lyapunov - based control design for natural trajectory - tracking problems is analyzed for quantum states where the analysis in the generic case is not applicable . using dynamical systems tools we show almost global asymptotic stability for stationary target states subject to certain conditions on the hamiltonians , and discuss effectiveness of the design when these conditions are not satisfied . for pseudo - pure target states the effectiveness of the design is studied further for both stationary and non - stationary states using alternative tools .
