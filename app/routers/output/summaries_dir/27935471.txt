the reversible circuit synthesis problem can be reduced to permutation group . this allows schreier - sims algorithm for the strong generating set - finding problem to be used to find tight bounds on the synthesis of 3-bit reversible circuits using the nft library . the tight bounds include the maximum and minimum length of 3-bit reversible circuits , the maximum and minimum cost of 3-bit reversible circuits . the analysis shows better results than that found in the literature for the lower bound of the cost . the analysis also shows that there are 1960 universal reversible sub - libraries from the main nft library .
