what happens if in qma the quantum channel between merlin and arthur is noisy ? it is not difficult to show that such a modification does not change the computational power as long as the noise is not too strong so that errors are correctable with high probability , since if merlin encodes the witness state in a quantum error - correction code and sends it to arthur , arthur can correct the error caused by the noisy channel . if we further assume that arthur can do only single - qubit measurements , however , the problem becomes nontrivial , since in this case arthur can not do the universal quantum computation by himself . in this paper , we show that such a restricted complexity class is still equivalent to qma . to show it , we use measurement - based quantum computing : honest merlin sends the graph state to arthur , and arthur does fault - tolerant measurement - based quantum computing on the noisy graph state with only single - qubit measurements . by measuring stabilizer operators , arthur also checks the correctness of the graph state . although this idea itself was already used in several previous papers , these results can not be directly used to the present case , since the test that checks the graph state used in these papers is so strict that even honest merlin is rejected with high probability if the channel is noisy . we therefore introduce a more relaxed test that can accept not only the ideal graph state but also noisy graph states that are error - correctable .
