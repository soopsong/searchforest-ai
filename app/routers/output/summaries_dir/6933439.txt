the objective of this work is to study time - minimum and energy - minimum global optimal control for dissipative open quantum systems whose dynamics is governed by the lindblad equation . the controls appear only in the hamiltonian . using recent results regarding the decoupling of such dissipative dynamics into intra- and inter - unitary orbits , we transform the control system into a bi - linear control system on the bloch ball ( the unitary sphere together with its interior ) . we then design a numerical algorithm to construct an optimal path to achieve a desired point given initial states close to the origin ( the singular point ) of the bloch ball . this is done both for the minimum - time and minimum -energy control problems .
