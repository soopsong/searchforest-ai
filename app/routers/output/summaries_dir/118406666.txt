we show that it is possible to construct closed quantum systems governed by a bilinear hamiltonian depending on an arbitrary input signal . this is achieved by coupling the system to a quantum input field and performing a feedback of the output field back into the system to cancel out the stochastic effects , with the signal being added to the field between these events and later subtracted . here we assume the zero time delay limit between the various connections and operations .
