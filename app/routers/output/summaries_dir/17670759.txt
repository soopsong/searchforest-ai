we develop a temperature measurement of an atomic cloud based on the temporal correlations of fluorescence photons evanescently coupled into an optical nanofiber . we measure the temporal width of the intensity - intensity correlation function due to atomic transit time and use it to determine the most probable atomic velocity , hence the temperature . this technique agrees well with standard time - of - flight temperature measurements . we confirm our results with trajectory simulations .
