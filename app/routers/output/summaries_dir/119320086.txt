we focus on the three - state quantum walk(qw ) in one dimension . in this paper , we give the stationary measure in general condition , originated from the eigenvalue problem . firstly , we get the transfer matrices by our new recipe , and solve the eigenvalue problem . then we obtain the general form of the stationary measure for concrete initial state and eigenvalue . we also show some specific examples of the stationary measure for the three - state qw . one of the interesting and crucial future problems is to make clear the whole picture of the set of stationary measures .
