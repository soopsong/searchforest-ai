the evolution of an open system is usually associated with the interaction of the system with an environment . a new method to study the open - type system evolution of a qubit ( two - level atom ) state is established . this evolution is determined by a unitary transformation applied to the qutrit ( three - level atom ) state , which defines the qubit subsystems . this procedure can be used to obtain different qubit quantum channels employing unitary transformations into the qutrit system . in particular , we study the phase damping and spontaneous - emission quantum channels . in addition , we mention a proposal for quasiunitary transforms of qubits , in view of the unitary transform of the total qutrit system . the experimental realization is also addressed . the probability representation of the evolution and its information - entropic characteristics are considered .
