we derive the optimal measurement for quantum state discrimination without a priori probabilities , i.e. in a minimax strategy instead of the usually considered bayesian one . we consider both minimal - error and unambiguous discrimination problems , and provide the relation between the optimal measurements according to the two schemes . we show that there are instances in which the minimum risk can not be achieved by an orthogonal measurement , and this is a common feature of the minimax estimation strategy .
