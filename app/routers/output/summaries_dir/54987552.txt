we characterise gaussian quantum channels that are gaussian incompatibility breaking , that is , transform every set of gaussian measurements into a set obtainable from a joint gaussian observable via gaussian postprocessing . such channels represent local noise which renders measurements useless for gaussian epr - steering , providing the appropriate generalisation of entanglement breaking channels for this scenario . understanding the structure of gaussian incompatibility breaking channels contributes to the resource theory of noisy continuous variable quantum information protocols .
