in this work it is pointed out that some physical theories , even being themselves falsifiable , predict the existence of regions of spacetime which are not falsifiable with relation to each other due to their impossibility of mutually exchanging information as , for instance , before and after the event horizon of black holes . if we require scientific theories to be falsifiable , an isolated region should be discarded from scientific models developed by observers in other regions . here it is proposed that their existence can satisfy a weaker falsifiability condition , here called conditional asymptotic provability , which extend scientific reasoning through bayesian inference . limitations and some epistemic consequences of this proposal are discussed .
