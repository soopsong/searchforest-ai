quantum versions of de finetti 's theorem are powerful tools , yielding conceptually important insights into the security of key distribution protocols or tomography schemes and allowing to bound the error made by mean - field approaches . such theorems link the symmetry of a quantum state under the exchange of subsystems to negligible quantum correlations and are well understood and established in the context of distinguishable particles . in this work , we derive a de finetti theorem for finite sized majorana fermionic systems . it is shown , much reflecting the spirit of other quantum de finetti theorems , that a state which is invariant under certain permutations of modes loses most of its anti - symmetric character and is locally well described by a mode separable state . we discuss the structure of the resulting mode separable states and establish in specific instances a quantitative link to the quality of hartree - fock approximation of quantum systems . we hint at a link to generalized pauli principles for one - body reduced density operators . finally , building upon the obtained de finetti theorem , we generalize and extend the applicability of hudson 's fermionic central limit theorem .
