we describe a new type of blue detuned optical lattice for atom trapping which is intrinsically two dimensional , while providing three - dimensional atom localization . the lattice is insensitive to optical phase fluctuations since it does not depend on field interference between distinct optical beams . the array is created using a novel arrangement of weakly overlapping gaussian beams that creates a two - dimensional array of dark traps which are suitable for magic trapping of ground and rydberg states . we analyze the spatial localization that can be achieved and demonstrate trapping and detection of single cs atoms in 6 and 49 site two - dimensional arrays .
