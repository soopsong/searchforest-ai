herein , we present a feasible , general protocol for quantum communication within a network via generalized remote preparation of an arbitrary $ m$-qubit entangled state designed with genuine tripartite greenberger -- horne -- zeilinger - type entangled resources . during the implementations , we construct novel collective unitary operations ; these operations are tasked with performing the necessary phase transfers during remote state preparations . we have distilled our implementation methods into a five - step procedure , which can be used to faithfully recover the desired state during transfer . compared to previous existing schemes , our methodology features a greatly increased success probability . after the consumption of auxiliary qubits and the performance of collective unitary operations , the probability of successful state transfer is increased four - fold and eight - fold for arbitrary two- and three - qubit entanglements when compared to other methods within the literature , respectively . we conclude this paper with a discussion of the presented scheme for state preparation , including : success probabilities , reducibility and generalizability .
