applying an expansion in spherical harmonics , turns the black hole with its microstates into something about as transparent as the hydrogen atom was in the early days of quantum mechanics . it enables us to present a concise description of the evolution laws of these microstates , linking them to perturbative quantum field theory , in the background of the schwarzschild metric . three pieces of insight are obtained : one , we learn how the gravitational back reaction , whose dominant component can be calculated exactly , turns particles entering the hole , into particles leaving it , by exchanging the momentum- and position operators ; two , we find out how this effect removes firewalls , both on the future and the past event horizon , and three , we discover that the presence of region ii in the penrose diagram forces a topological twist in the background metric , culminating in antipodal identification . although a cut - off is required that effectively replaces the transverse coordinates by a lattice , the effect of such a cut - off minimizes when the spherical wave expansion is applied . this expansion then reveals exactly how antipodal identification restores unitarity - for each partial wave separately . we expect that these ideas will provide new insights in some highly non - trivial topological space - time features at the planck scale .
