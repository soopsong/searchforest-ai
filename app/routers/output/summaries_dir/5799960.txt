quantum trajectories describe the stochastic evolution of an open quantum system conditioned on continuous monitoring of its output , such as by an ideal photodetector . here we derive ( non - markovian ) quantum trajectories for realistic photodetection , including the effects of efficiency , dead time , bandwidth , electronic noise , and dark counts . we apply our theory to a realistic cavity qed scenario and investigate the impact of such detector imperfections on the conditional evolution of the system state . a practical theory of quantum trajectories with realistic detection will be essential for experimental and technological applications of quantum feedback in many areas .
