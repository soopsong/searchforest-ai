we present our approach for sharing photons and assessing resultant four - photon visibility between two distant parties using concatenated entanglement swapping . in addition we determine the corresponding key generation rate and the quantum bit - error rate . our model is based on practical limitations of resources , including multipair parametric down - conversion sources , inefficient detectors with dark counts and lossy channels . through this approach , we have found that a trade - off is needed between experimental run - time , pair - production rate and detector efficiency . concatenated entanglement swapping enables huge distances for quantum key - distribution but at the expense of low key generation rate .
