we propose a theoretical scheme to show the possibility of generating motional nonlinear coherent states and their superposition for an undamped vibrating micromechanical membrane inside an optical cavity . the scheme is based on an intensity - dependent coupling of the membrane to the radiation pressure field . we show that if the cavity field is initially prepared in a fock state , the motional state of the membrane may evolve from vacuum state to a special type of nonlinear coherent states . by examining the nonclassical properties of the generated state of the membrane , including the quadrature squeezing and the sub - poissonian statistics , we find that by varying the lamb - dicke parameter and the membrane 's reflectivity one can effectively control those properties . in addition , the scheme offers the possibility of generating various types of the so - called nonlinear multicomponent schrodinger cat sates of the membrane . we also examine the effect of the damping of the cavity field on the motional state of the membrane .
