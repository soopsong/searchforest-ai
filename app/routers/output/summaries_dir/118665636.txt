we formulate grover 's unstructured search algorithm as a chiral quantum walk , where transitioning in one direction has a phase conjugate to transitioning in the opposite direction . for small phases , this breaking of time - reversal symmetry is too small to significantly affect the evolution : the system still approximately evolves in its ground and first excited states , rotating to the marked vertex in time $ \pi \sqrt{n } / 2$. increasing the phase does not change the runtime , but rather changes the support for the 2d subspace , so the system evolves in its first and second excited states , or its second and third excited states , and so forth . apart from the critical phases corresponding to these transitions in the support , which become more frequent as the phase grows , this reveals that our model of quantum search is robust against time - reversal symmetry breaking .
