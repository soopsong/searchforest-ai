we demonstrate how structured decompositions of unitary operators can be employed to derive control schemes for finite - level quantum systems that require only sequences of simple control pulses such as square wave pulses with finite rise and decay times or gaussian wavepackets . to illustrate the technique it is applied to find control schemes to achieve population transfers for pure - state systems , complete inversions of the ensemble populations for mixed - state systems , create arbitrary superposition states and optimize the ensemble average of dynamic observables .
