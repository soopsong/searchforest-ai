we present a design for a superconducting , on - chip circulator composed of dynamically modulated transfer switches and delays . design goals are set for the multiplexed readout of superconducting qubits . simulations of the device show that it allows for low - loss circulation ( insertion loss<0.35 db and isolation>20 db ) over an instantaneous bandwidth of 2.3 ghz . as the device is estimated to be linear for input powers up to -65 dbm , this design improves on the bandwidth and power - handling of previous superconducting circulators by over a factor of 50 , making it ideal for integration with broadband quantum limited amplifiers .
