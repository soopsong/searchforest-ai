we report the first demonstrations of both quadrature squeezed vacuum and photon number difference squeezing generated in an integrated nanophotonic device . squeezed light is generated via strongly driven spontaneous four - wave mixing below threshold in silicon nitride microring resonators . the generated light is characterized with both homodyne detection and direct measurements of photon statistics using photon number - resolving transition edge sensors . we measure $ 1.0(1)$~db of broadband quadrature squeezing ( $ { \sim}4$~db inferred on - chip ) and $ 0.70(1)$ db of photon number difference squeezing ( $ { \sim}6$~db inferred on - chip ) . multi - photon events of over 10 photons are detected with rates exceeding any previous quantum optical demonstration using integrated nanophotonics . these results will have an enabling impact on scaling continuous variable quantum technology .
