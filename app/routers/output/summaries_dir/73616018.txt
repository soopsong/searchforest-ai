the correspondence between classical spin models and quantum states has attracted much attention in recent years . however , it remains an open problem as to which specific spin model a given ( well - known ) quantum state maps to . in this letter , we provide such an explicit correspondence for an important class of quantum states where a duality relation is proved between classical spin models and quantum calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) states . in particular , we employ graph - theoretic methods to prove that the partition function of a classical spin model on a hypergraph $ h$ is equal to the inner product of a product state with a quantum css state on a dual hypergraph $ \tilde{h}$. we next use this dual correspondence to prove that the critical behavior of the classical system corresponds to a relative stability of the corresponding css state to bit - flip ( and phase - flip ) noise , thus called critical stability . we finally conjecture that such critical stability is related to the topological order in quantum css states , thus providing a possible practical characterization of such states .
