we investigate the fundamental limitations imposed by thermodynamics for creating correlations . considering a collection of initially uncorrelated thermal quantum systems , we ask how much classical and quantum correlations can be obtained via a cyclic hamiltonian process . we derive bounds on both the mutual information and entanglement of formation , as a function of the temperature of the systems and the available energy . while for a finite number of systems there is a maximal temperature allowing for the creation of entanglement , we show that genuine multipartite entanglement --- the strongest form of entanglement in multipartite systems --- can be created at any temperature when sufficiently many systems are considered . this approach may find applications , e.g. in quantum information processing , for physical platforms in which thermodynamic considerations can not be ignored .
