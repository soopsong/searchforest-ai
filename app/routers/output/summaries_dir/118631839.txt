we present the dipole induced transparency ( dit ) of a diamond nitrogen - vacancy center embedded in a photonic crystal cavity coupled to two waveguides , and it is obvious with the robust and flexible reflectance and transmittance difference of circularly polarized lights between the uncoupled and the coupled cavities even in the bad cavity regime ( the purcell regime ) . with this dit , we propose two universal hyperparallel hybrid photonic quantum logic gates , including a hybrid hyper - controlled - not gate and a hybrid hyper - toffoli gate , on photon systems in both the polarization and the spatial - mode degrees of freedom ( dofs ) , which are equal to two identical quantum logic gates operating simultaneously on the systems in one dof . they can be used to perform more quantum operations with less resources in the quantum information protocols with multi - qubit systems in several dofs , which may depress the resources consumed and the photonic dissipation . moreover , they are more robust against asymmetric environment noise in the weak - coupling regime , compared with the integration of two cascaded quantum logic gates in one dof .
