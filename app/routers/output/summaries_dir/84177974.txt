we numerically model decaying quantum turbulence in two - dimensional disk - shaped bose - einstein condensates , and investigate the effects of finite temperature on the turbulent dynamics . we prepare initial states with a range of condensate temperatures , and imprint equal numbers of vortices and antivortices at randomly chosen positions throughout the fluid . the initial states are then subjected to unitary time - evolution within the c - field methodology . for the lowest condensate temperatures , the results of the zero temperature gross - pitaevskii theory are reproduced , whereby vortex evaporative heating leads to the formation of onsager vortex clusters characterised by a negative absolute vortex temperature . at higher condensate temperatures the dissipative effects due to vortex - phonon interactions tend to drive the vortex gas towards positive vortex temperatures dominated by the presence of vortex dipoles . we associate these two behaviours with the system evolving toward an anomalous non - thermal fixed point , or a gaussian thermal fixed point , respectively . the cross - over between these two dynamical behaviours is found to occur at earlier times with increasing condensate temperature .
