the transient casimir - polder force on a two - level atom introduced into a three - dimensional , inhomogeneous , generally non - reciprocal environment is evaluated using non - markovian weisskopf - wigner theory in the strong and weak coupling regimes . ground - state and excited atoms are considered as two separate initial - value problems , and both the short - time and long - time atomic population and force are evaluated . the results are compared with various markov approximation of the weisskopf - wigner theory , and with previous markov results from the heisenberg picture .
