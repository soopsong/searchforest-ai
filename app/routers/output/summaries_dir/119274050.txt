i discuss a variety of issues relating to near - future experiments demonstrating fault - tolerant quantum computation . i describe a family of fault - tolerant quantum circuits that can be performed with 5 qubits arranged on a ring with nearest - neighbor interactions . i also present a criterion whereby we can say that an experiment has succeeded in demonstrating fault tolerance . finally , i discuss the possibility of using future fault - tolerant experiments to answer important questions about the interaction of fault - tolerant protocols with real experimental errors .
