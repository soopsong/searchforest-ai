we investigate a hybrid quantum system where an ensemble of nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers in diamond is interfaced with a piezomagnetic superlattice that supports surface phonon polaritons ( sphps ) . we show that the strong magnetic coupling between the collective spin waves in the nv spin ensemble and the quantized sphps can be realized , thanks to the subwavelength nature of the sphps and relatively long spin coherence times . the magnon - polariton coupling allows different modes of the sphps to be mapped and orthogonally stored in different spatial modes of excitation in the solid medium . because of its easy implementation and high tunability , the proposed hybrid structure with nv spins and piezoactive superlattices could be used for quantum memory and quantum computation .
