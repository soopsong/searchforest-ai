a significant limitation of practical quantum key distribution ( qkd ) setups is currently their limited operational range . it has recently been emphasized ( x. ma , c.-h . f. fung , and h.-k . lo . , phys . rev . a , 76:012307 , 2007 ) that entanglement - based qkd systems can tolerate higher channel losses than systems based on weak coherent laser pulses ( wcp ) , in particular when the source is located symmetrically between the two communicating parties , alice and bob . in the work presented here , we experimentally study this important advantage by implementing different entanglement - based qkd setups on a 144~km free - space link between the two canary islands of la palma and tenerife . we established three different configurations where the entangled photon source was placed at alice 's location , asymmetrically between alice and bob and symmetrically in the middle between alice and bob , respectively . the resulting quantum channel attenuations of 35~db , 58~db and 71~db , respectively , significantly exceed the limit for wcp systems . this confirms that qkd over distances of 300~km and even more is feasible with entangled state sources placed in the middle between alice and bob .
