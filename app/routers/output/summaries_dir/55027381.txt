we measure the modification of the transmission spectra of cold $ ^{87}$rb atoms in the proximity of an optical nanofiber ( onf ) . van der waals interactions between the atoms an the onf surface decrease the resonance frequency of atoms closer to the surface . an asymmetric spectra of the atoms holds information of their spatial distribution around the onf . we use a far - detuned laser beam coupled to the onf to thermally excite atoms at the onf surface . we study the change of transmission spectrum of these atoms as a function of heating laser power . a semi - classical phenomenological model for the thermal excitation of atoms in the atom - surface van der waals bound states is in good agreement with the measurements . this result suggests that van der waals potentials could be used to trap and probe atoms at few nanometers from a dielectric surfaces , a key tool for hybrid photonic - atomic quantum systems .
