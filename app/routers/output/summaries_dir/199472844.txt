we investigate a heat engine with a finite length kitaev chain in an otto cycle . finite size effects are taken into account using method of hill 's nano - thermodynamics as well as using the method of temperature dependent energy levels . we distinguish the bulk and boundary contributions to the efficiency and the work output of kitaev chain engine and identify them as non - otto heat engine and refrigerator cycles , respectively . possibility of separately running otto engine cycles associated with the bulk and the whole system , and an otto refrigerator at the boundary is pointed out . it is found that the critical point of the topological phase coincides with the extremum of the efficiency and the work output of the bulk and the total otto engine .
