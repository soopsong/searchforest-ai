we report a theoretical study of a double - well ramsey interferometer using internal state labelling . we consider the use of a thermal ensemble of cold atoms rather than a bose - einstein condensate to minimize the effects of atomic interactions . to maintain a satisfactory level of coherence in this case , a high degree of symmetry is required between the two arms of the interferometer . assuming that the splitting and recombination processes are adiabatic , we theoretically derive the phase - shift and the contrast of such an interferometer in the presence of gravity or an acceleration field . we also consider using a"shortcut to adiabaticity"protocol to speed up the splitting process and discuss how such a procedure affects the phase shift and contrast . we find that the two procedures lead to phase - shifts of the same form .
