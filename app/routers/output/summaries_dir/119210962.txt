it is well known that most of the frequently used reversible logic gates ( e.g. , not , cnot , swap , toffoli , fredkin ) are self - inverse and are represented by square matrices that are unitary and hermitian . however , with a simple minded argument , it is established that the most of the allowed reversible gates are non - self - inverse ( unitary but non - hermitian ) in nature . it is also shown that the % of non - hermitian gates increases with the dimension . for example , 58.33 % of the 2-bit gates , 98.10 % of the 3-bit gates and 99.99 % of the 4-bit gates are non - hermitian . as classical reversible gates are essentially permutation gates , above statistics is strictly valid for classical reversible gates , but the argument can be easily extended to include quantum gates and to establish that the majority of the quantum gates are also non - self - inverse . further , the % of genuinely 2-bit reversible gates ( i.e. , 2-bit gates that can not be decomposed as a product of two single bit gates ) among all possible gates has been computed as 83.3 % , and the applicability of this analysis in the optimization of circuit cost is discussed .
