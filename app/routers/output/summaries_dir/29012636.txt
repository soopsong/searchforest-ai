wave propagation in disordered media can be strongly modified by multiple scattering and wave interference . ultimately the so - called anderson - localized regime is reached when the waves become strongly confined in space . so far , anderson localization of light has been probed in transmission experiments by measuring the intensity of an external light source after propagation through a disordered medium . however , discriminating between anderson localization and losses in these experiments remains a major challenge . here we present an alternative approach where we use quantum emitters embedded in disordered photonic crystal waveguides as light sources . anderson - localized modes are efficiently excited and the analysis of the photoluminescence spectra allows to explore their statistical properties paving a way for controlling anderson localization in disordered photonic crystals .
