we explore whether localized surface plasmon polariton modes can transfer heat between molecules placed in the hot spot of a nanoplasmonic cavity through optomechanical interaction with the molecular vibrations . we demonstrate that external driving of the plasmon resonance indeed induces an effective molecule - molecule interaction corresponding to a new heat transfer mechanism , which can even be more effective in cooling the hotter molecule than its heating due to the vibrational pumping by the plasmon . this novel mechanism allows to actively control the rate of heat flow between molecules through the intensity and frequency of the driving laser .
