based on the theory of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics , we generalize the expression of the casimir force for nonreciprocal media . the essential ingredient of this result is the green 's tensor between two nonreciprocal semi - infinite slabs including a reflexion matrix with four coefficients that mixes optical polarizations . this green 's tensor does not obey lorentz 's reciprocity and thus violates time - reversal symmetry . the general result for the casimir force is analyzed in the retarded and nonretarded limits , concentrating on the influences arising from reflections with or without change of polarization . in a second step we apply our general result to a photonic topological insulator whose nonreciprocity stems from an anisotropic permittivity tensor , namely insb . we show that there is a regime for the distance between the slabs where the magnitude of the casimir force is tunable by an external magnetic field . furthermore the strength of this tuning depends on the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the slab surfaces .
