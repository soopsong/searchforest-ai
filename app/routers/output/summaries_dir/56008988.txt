finite frames can be viewed as mass points distributed in $ n$-dimensional euclidean space . as such they form a subclass of a larger and rich class of probability measures that we call probabilistic frames . we derive the basic properties of probabilistic frames , and we characterize one of their subclasses in terms of minimizers of some appropriate potential function . in addition , we survey a range of areas where probabilistic frames , albeit , under different names , appear . these areas include directional statistics , the geometry of convex bodies , and the theory of t - designs .
