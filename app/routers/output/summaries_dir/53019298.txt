one of the roadmap plans for quantum computers is an integration within hpc ecosystems assigning them a role of accelerators for a variety of computationally hard tasks . however , in the near term , quantum hardware will be in a constant state of change . heading towards solving real - world problems , we advocate development of portable , architecture - agnostic hybrid quantum - classical frameworks and demonstrate one for the community detection problem evaluated using quantum annealing and gate - based universal quantum computation paradigms .
