quantum teleportation is one of the crucial protocols in quantum information processing . it is important to accomplish an efficient teleportation under practical conditions , aiming at a higher fidelity desirably using fewer resources . the continuous - variable ( cv ) version of quantum teleportation was first proposed using a gaussian state as a quantum resource , while other attempts were also made to improve performance by applying non - gaussian operations . we investigate the cv teleportation to find its ultimate fidelity under energy constraint identifying an optimal quantum state . for this purpose , we present a formalism to evaluate teleportation fidelity as an expectation value of an operator . using this formalism , we prove that the optimal state must be a form of photon - number entangled states . we further show that gaussian states are near - optimal while non - gaussian states make a slight improvement and therefore are rigorously optimal , particularly in the low - energy regime .
