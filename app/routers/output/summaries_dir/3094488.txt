the feasibility of computationally superior quantum computers is one of the most exciting and clear - cut scientific questions of our time . the question touches on fundamental issues regarding probability , physics , and computability , as well as on exciting problems in experimental physics , engineering , computer science , and mathematics . we propose three related directions towards a negative answer . the first is a conjecture about physical realizations of quantum codes , the second has to do with correlations in stochastic physical systems , and the third proposes a model for quantum evolutions when noise accumulates . the paper is dedicated to the memory of itamar pitowsky .
