hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interference between independent photon sources ( homi - ips ) is the fundamental block for quantum information processing , such as quantum gate , shor 's algorithm , boson sampling , etc . all the previous homi - ips experiments were carried out in time - domain , however , the spectral information during the interference was lost , due to technical difficulties . here , we investigate the homi - ips in spectral domain using the recently developed fast fiber spectrometer , and demonstrate the spectral distribution during the hom interference between two heralded single - photon sources , and two thermal sources . this experiment can not only deepen our understanding of homi - ips in the spectral domain , but also be utilized to improve the visibility by post - processing spectral filtering .
