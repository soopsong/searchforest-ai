the interactions between light and matter are strongly enhanced when atoms are placed in high - finesse quantum cavities , offering tantalizing opportunities for generating exotic new quantum phases . in this work we show that both spin - orbit interactions and strong synthetic magnetic fields result when a neutral atom is confined within a ring cavity , whenever the internal atomic states are coupled to two off - resonant counter - propagating modes . we diagonalize the resulting cavity polariton hamiltonian and find characteristic spin - orbit dispersion relations for a wide range of parameters . an adjustable uniform gauge potential is also generated , which can be converted into a synthetic magnetic field for neutral atoms by applying an external magnetic field gradient . very large synthetic magnetic fields are possible as the strength is proportional to the ( average ) number of photons in each of the cavity modes . the results suggest that strong - coupling cavity quantum electrodynamics can be a useful environment for the formation of topological states in atomic systems .
