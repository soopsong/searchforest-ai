stochastic schr{\"o}dinger equations for quantum trajectories offer an alternative and sometimes superior approach to the study of open quantum system dynamics . here we show that recently established convolutionless non - markovian stochastic schr{\"o}dinger equations may serve as a powerful tool for the derivation of convolutionless master equations for non - markovian open quantum systems . the most interesting example is quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) of a harmonic oscillator coupled to a heat bath of oscillators , one of the most - employed exactly soluble models of open system dynamics . we show explicitly how to establish the direct connection between the exact convolutionless master equation of qbm and the corresponding convolutionless exact stochastic schr\"odinger equation .
