we demonstrate a compact ( 0.25 l ) system for laser cooling and trapping atoms from a heated dispenser source . our system uses a nanofabricated diffraction grating to generate a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) using a single input laser beam . an aperture in the grating allows atoms from the dispenser to be loaded from behind the chip , increasing the interaction distance of atoms with the cooling light . to take full advantage of this increased distance , we extend the magnetic field gradient of the mot to create a zeeman slower . the mot traps approximately $ 10 ^ 6 $ $ ^7$li atoms emitted from an effusive source with loading rates in excess of $ 10 ^ 6 $ s$^{-1}$. our design is portable to a variety of atomic and molecular species and could be a principal component of miniaturized cold - atom - based technologies .
