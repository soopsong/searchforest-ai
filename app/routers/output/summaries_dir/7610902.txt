we explore excitonic energy transfer dynamics in a molecular dimer system coupled to both structured and unstructured oscillator environments . by extending the reaction coordinate master equation technique developed in [ j. iles - smith , n. lambert , and a. nazir , phys . rev . a 90 , 032114 ( 2014 ) ] , we go beyond the commonly used born - markov approximations to incorporate system - environment correlations and the resultant non - markovian dynamical effects . we obtain energy transfer dynamics for both underdamped and overdamped oscillator environments that are in perfect agreement with the numerical hierarchical equations of motion over a wide range of parameters . furthermore , we show that the zusman equations , which may be obtained in a semiclassical limit of the reaction coordinate model , are often incapable of describing the correct dynamical behaviour . this demonstrates the necessity of properly accounting for quantum correlations generated between the system and its environment when the born - markov approximations no longer hold . finally , we apply the reaction coordinate formalism to the case of a structured environment comprising of both underdamped ( i.e. sharply peaked ) and overdamped ( broad ) components simultaneously . we find that though an enhancement of the dimer energy transfer rate can be obtained when compared to an unstructured environment , its magnitude is rather sensitive to both the dimer - peak resonance conditions and the relative strengths of the underdamped and overdamped contributions .
