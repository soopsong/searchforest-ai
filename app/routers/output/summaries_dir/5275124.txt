we examine nonclassical properties of the field states generated by applying the photon annihilation - then - creation operation ( ac ) and creation - then - annihilation operation ( ca ) to the thermal and coherent states . effects of repeated applications of ac and of ca are also studied . we also discuss experimental schemes to realize ac and ca with a cavity system using atom - field interactions .
