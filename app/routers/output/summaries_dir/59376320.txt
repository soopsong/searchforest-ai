we describe a direct method to determine the negativity of an arbitrary two - qubit state in experiments . the method is derived by analyzing the relation between the purity , negativity , and a universal entanglement witness for two - qubit entanglement . we show how the negativity of a two - qubit state can be calculated from just three experimentally accessible moments of the partially transposed density matrix of a two - photon state . moreover , we show that the negativity can be given as a function of only six invariants , which are linear combinations of nine invariants from the complete set of 21 fundamental and independent two - qubit invariants . we analyze the relation between these moments and the concurrence for some classes of two - qubit states ( including the x states , as well as pure states affected by the amplitude - damping and phase - damping channels ) . we also discuss the possibility of using the universal entanglement witness as an entanglement measure for various classes of two - qubit states . moreover , we analyze how noise affects the estimation of entanglement via this witness .
