it is a topic of fundamental and practical importance how a quantum correlated state can be reliably distributed through a noisy channel for quantum information processing . the concept of quantum steering recently defined in a rigorous manner is relevant to study it under certain circumstances and we here address quantum steerability of gaussian states to this aim . in particular , we attempt to reformulate the criterion for gaussian steering in terms of local and global purities and show that it is sufficient and necessary for the case of steering a 1-mode system by a $ n$-mode system . it subsequently enables us to reinforce a strong monogamy relation under which only one party can steer a local system of 1-mode . moreover , we show that only a negative partial - transpose state can manifest quantum steerability by gaussian measurements in relation to the peres conjecture . we also discuss our formulation for the case of distributing a two - mode squeezed state via one - way quantum channels making dissipation and amplification effects , respectively . finally , we extend our approach to include non - gaussian measurements , more precisely , all orders of higher - order squeezing measurements , and find that this broad set of non - gaussian measurements is not useful to demonstrate steering for gaussian states beyond gaussian measurements .
