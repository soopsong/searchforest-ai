quantum error correction and fault - tolerance make it possible to perform quantum computations in the presence of imprecision and imperfections of realistic devices . an important question is to find the noise rate at which errors can be arbitrarily suppressed . by concatenating the 7-qubit steane and 15-qubit reed - muller codes , the 105-qubit code enables a universal set of fault - tolerant gates despite not all of them being transversal . importantly , the cnot gate remains transversal in both codes , and as such has increased error protection relative to the other single qubit logical gates . we show that while the level-1 pseudo - threshold for the concatenated scheme is limited by the logical hadamard , the error suppression of the logical cnot gates allows for the asymptotic threshold to increase by orders of magnitude at higher levels . we establish a lower bound of $ 1.28~\times~10^{-3}$ for the asymptotic threshold of this code which is competitive with known concatenated models and does not rely on ancillary magic state preparation for universal computation .
