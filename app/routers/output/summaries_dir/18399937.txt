since the introduction of binomial state as an intermediate state , different intermediate states have been proposed . different nonclassical effects have also been reported in these intermediate states . but till now higher order antibunching or higher order subpoissonian photon statistics is predicted only in one type of intermediate state , namely shadowed negative binomial state . recently we have shown the existence of higher order antibunching in some simple nonlinear optical processes to establish that higher order antibunching is not a rare phenomenon ( j. phys . b 39 ( 2006 ) 1137 ) . to establish our earlier claim further , here we have shown that the higher order antibunching can be seen in different intermediate states , such as binomial state , reciprocal binomial state , hypergeometric state , generalized binomial state , negative binomial state and photon added coherent state . we have studied the possibility of observing the higher order subpoissonian photon statistics in different limits of intermediate states . the effect of different control parameters have also been studied in this connection and it has been shown that the depth of nonclassicality can be tuned by controlling various physical parameters .
