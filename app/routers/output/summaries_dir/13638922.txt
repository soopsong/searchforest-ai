analyses of phenomena exhibiting finite - time decay of quantum entanglement have recently attracted considerable attention . such decay is often referred to as sudden vanishing ( or sudden death ) of entanglement , which can be followed by its sudden reappearance ( or sudden rebirth ) . we analyze various finite - time decays ( for dissipative systems ) and analogous periodic vanishings ( for unitary systems ) of nonclassical correlations as described by violations of classical inequalities and the corresponding nonclassicality witnesses ( or quantumness witnesses ) , which are not necessarily entanglement witnesses . we show that these sudden vanishings are universal phenomena and can be observed : ( i ) not only for two- or multi - mode but also for single - mode nonclassical fields , ( ii ) not solely for dissipative systems , and ( iii ) at evolution times which are usually different from those of sudden vanishings and reappearances of quantum entanglement .
