the main goal of this paper is to extend and apply the principle of maximum entropy ( maxent ) to incomplete quantum process estimation tasks . we will define a so - called process entropy function being the von neumann entropy of the state associated with the quantum process via choi - jamiolkowski isomorphism . it will be shown that an arbitrary process estimation experiment can be reformulated in a unified framework and maxent principle can be consistently exploited . we will argue that the suggested choice for the process entropy satisfies natural list of properties and it reduces to the state maxent principle , if applied to preparator devices .
