we present decay bounds for a broad class of hermitian matrix functions where the matrix argument is banded or a kronecker sum of banded matrices . besides being significantly tighter than previous estimates , the new bounds closely capture the actual ( non - monotonic ) decay behavior of the entries of functions of matrices with kronecker sum structure . we also discuss extensions to more general sparse matrices .
