in this work we experimentally demonstrate for the first time a recently proposed criterion adressed to detect nonclassical behavior in the fluorescence emission of ensembles of single - photon emitters . in particular , we apply the method to study clusters of nv centres in diamond observed via single - photon - sensitive confocal microscopy . theoretical considerations on the behavior of the parameter at any arbitrary order in presence of poissonian noise are presented and , finally , the opportunity of detecting manifold coincidences is discussed .
