we develop an all - optical scheme to generate superpositions of macroscopically distinguishable coherent states in traveling optical fields . it non - deterministically distills coherent state superpositions ( csss ) with large amplitudes out of csss with small amplitudes using inefficient photon detection . the small csss required to produce csss with larger amplitudes are extremely well approximated by squeezed single photons . we discuss some remarkable features of this scheme : it effectively purifies mixed initial states emitted from inefficient single photon sources and boosts negativity of wigner functions of quantum states .
