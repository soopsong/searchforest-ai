we present a decomposition scheme based on lie - trotter - suzuki product formulae to represent an ordered operator exponential as a product of ordinary operator exponentials . we provide a rigorous proof that does not use a time - displacement superoperator , and can be applied to non - analytic functions . our proof provides explicit bounds on the error and includes cases where the functions are not infinitely differentiable . we show that lie - trotter - suzuki product formulae can still be used for functions that are not infinitely differentiable , but that arbitrary order scaling may not be achieved .
