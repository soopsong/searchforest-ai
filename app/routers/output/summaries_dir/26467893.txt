we demonstrate a high bit - rate quantum random number generator by interferometric detection of phase diffusion in a gain - switched dfb laser diode . gain switching at few - ghz frequencies produces a train of bright pulses with nearly equal amplitudes and random phases . an unbalanced mach - zehnder interferometer is used to interfere subsequent pulses and thereby generate strong random - amplitude pulses , which are detected and digitized to produce a high - rate random bit string . using established models of semiconductor laser field dynamics , we predict a regime of high visibility interference and nearly complete vacuum - fluctuation - induced phase diffusion between pulses . these are confirmed by measurement of pulse power statistics at the output of the interferometer . using a 5.825 ghz excitation rate and 14-bit digitization , we observe 43 gbps quantum randomness generation .
