we propose an analytical method to study the entangled spatial and spin dynamics of interacting bimodal bose - einstein condensates . we show that at particular times during the evolution spatial and spin dynamics disentangle and the spin squeezing can be predicted by a simple two - mode model . we calculate the maximum spin squeezing achievable in experimentally relevant situations with sodium or rubidium bimodal condensates , including the effect of the dynamics and of one , two and three - body losses .
