quantum metrology is a promising practical use case for quantum technologies , where physical quantities can be measured with unprecedented precision . in lieu of quantum error correction procedures , near term quantum devices are expected to be noisy , and we have to make do with noisy probe states . with carefully chosen symmetric probe states inspired by the quantum error correction capabilities of certain symmetric codes , we prove that quantum metrology can exhibit an advantage over classical metrology , even after the probe states are corrupted by a constant number of erasure and dephasing errors . these probe states prove useful for robust metrology not only in the nisq regime , but also in the asymptotic setting where they achieve heisenberg scaling . this brings us closer towards making robust quantum metrology a technological reality .
