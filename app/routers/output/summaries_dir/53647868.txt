we investigate quantum teleportation through dissipative channels and calculate teleportation fidelity as a function of damping rates . it is found that the average fidelity of teleportation and the range of states to be teleported depend on the type and rate of the damping in the channel . using the fully entangled fraction , we derive two bounds on the damping rates of the channels : one is to beat the classical limit and the second is to guarantee the non - existence of any other copy with better fidelity . effect of the initially distributed maximally entangled state on the process is presented ; and the concurrence and the fully entangled fraction of the shared states are discussed . we intend to show that prior information on the dissipative channel and the range of qubit states to be teleported is helpful for the evaluation of the success of teleportation , where success is defined as surpassing the fidelity limit imposed by the fidelity of 1-to-2 optimal cloning machine for the specific range of qubits .
