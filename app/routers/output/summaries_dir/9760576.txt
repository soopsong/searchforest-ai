building on the previous results of the weyl chamber steering method , we demonstrate how to generate high - fidelity controlled - not by direct application of certain , physically relevant hamiltonians with fixed coupling constants containing rabi terms . such hamiltonians are often used to describe two superconducting qubits driven by local rf - pulses . it is found that in order to achieve 100 % fidelity in a system with capacitive coupling of strength g one rabi term suffices . we give the exact values of the physical parameters needed to implement such cnot . the gate time and all possible rabi frequencies are found to be t = pi/(2 g ) and omega_1 / g = sqrt(64n^2 - 1 ) , n=1,2,3 , ... . generation of a perfect cnot in a system with inductive coupling , characterized by additional constant k , requires the presence of both rabi terms . the gate time is again t = pi/(2 g ) , but now there is an infinite number of solutions , each of which is valid in a certain range of k and is characterized by a pair of positive integers ( n , m ) . we distinguish two cases , depending on the sign of the coupling constant : ( 1 ) the antiferromagnetic case ( k>=0 ) ; ( 2 ) the ferromagnetic case ( k<=0 ) . the paper concludes with consideration of fidelity degradation by switching to resonance . simulation of time - evolution based on the 4th order magnus expansion reveals characteristics of the gate similar to those found in the exact case , with slightly shorter gate time and shifted values of rabi frequencies .
