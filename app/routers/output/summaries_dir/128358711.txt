we investigate , in the framework of open quantum systems , the entanglement dynamics of two circularly accelerated two - level atoms with the same centripetal acceleration interacting with a bath of fluctuating electromagnetic fields in the minkowski vacuum . we assume that the two atoms rotate synchronically with their separation perpendicular to the rotating plane , and study the entanglement degradation , creation , revival , and enhancement by solving the markovian master equation . in contrast to the scalar - field case , the entanglement dynamics is crucially dependent on the atomic polarizations in the sense that the polarization directions may affect the entanglement decay rate , and may determine the occurrences of entanglement creation , revival and enhancement . compared with the uniformly accelerated case and the thermal case , the decay rate of entanglement for circularly accelerated atoms is larger , while the revival and enhancement rates are smaller .
