we theoretically investigate the generation of heralded entanglement between two identical atoms via cavity - assisted photon scattering in two different configurations , namely either both atoms confined in the same cavity or trapped into locally separated ones . our protocols are given by a very simple and elegant single - step process , whose key mechanism is a controlled - phase - flip gate implemented by impinging a single photon on single - sided cavities . in particular , when the atoms are localized in remote cavities , we introduce a single - step parallel quantum circuit instead of the serial process extensively adopted in the literature . we also show that such parallel circuit can be straightforwardly applied to entangle two macroscopic clouds of atoms . both protocols proposed here predict a high entanglement degree with a success probability close to the unity for the state - of - the - art parameters . among other applications , our proposal and its extension to multiple atom - cavity systems step toward a suitable route for quantum networking , in particular for quantum state transfer , quantum teleportation and nonlocal quantum memory .
