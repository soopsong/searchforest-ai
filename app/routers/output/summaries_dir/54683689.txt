generalized hydrodynamics ( ghd ) is a large - scale theory for the dynamics of many - body integrable systems . it consists of an infinite set of conservation laws for quasi - particles traveling with effective ( " dressed " ) velocities that depend on the local state . we show that these equations can be recast into a geometric dynamical problem . they are conservation equations with state - independent quasi - particle velocities , in a space equipped with a family of metrics , parametrized by the quasi - particles ' type and speed , that depend on the local state . in the classical hard rod or soliton gas picture , these metrics measure the free length of space as perceived by quasi - particles , in the quantum picture , they weigh space with the density of states available to them . using this geometric construction , we find a general solution to the initial value problem of ghd , in terms of a set of integral equations where time appears explicitly . these integral equations are solvable by iteration and provide an extremely efficient solution algorithm for ghd .
