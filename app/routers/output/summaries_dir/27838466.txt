a quantum random number generator ( qrng ) generates genuine randomness from the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics . the central problems for most qrngs are estimating the entropy of the genuine randomness and producing such randomness at high rates . here we propose and demonstrate a proof - of - concept qrng that operates at a high rate of 24 mbit / s by means of a high - dimensional entanglement system , in which the user monitors the entropy in real time via the observation of a nonlocal quantum interference , without a detailed characterization of the devices . our work provides an important approach to a robust qrng with trusted but error - prone devices .
