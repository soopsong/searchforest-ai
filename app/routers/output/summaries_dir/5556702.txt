we derive easily verifiable conditions which characterize when complex seidel matrices containing cube roots of unity have exactly two eigenvalues . the existence of such matrices is equivalent to the existence of equiangular tight frames for which the inner product between any two frame vectors is always a common multiple of the cube roots of unity . we also exhibit a relationship between these equiangular tight frames , complex seidel matrices , and highly regular , directed graphs . we construct examples of such frames with arbitrarily many vectors .
