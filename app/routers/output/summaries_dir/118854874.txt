the long time accumulation of the \textit{random } actions of a single particle"reservoir"on its coupled system can transfer some temperature information of its initial state to the coupled system . this dynamic process can be referred to as a quantum thermalization in the sense that the coupled system can reach a stable thermal equilibrium with a temperature equal to that of the reservoir . we illustrate this idea based on the usual micromaser model , in which a series of initially prepared two - level atoms randomly pass through an electromagnetic cavity . it is found that , when the randomly injected atoms are initially prepared in a thermal equilibrium state with a given temperature , the cavity field will reach a thermal equilibrium state with the same temperature as that of the injected atoms . as in two limit cases , the cavity field can be cooled and"coherently heated"as a maser process , respectively , when the injected atoms are initially prepared in ground and excited states . especially , when the atoms in equilibrium are driven to possess some coherence , the cavity field may reach a higher temperature in comparison with the injected atoms . we also point out a possible experimental test for our theoretical prediction based on a superconducting circuit qed system .
