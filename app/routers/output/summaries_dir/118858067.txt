using a geometric measure of entanglement quantification based on euclidean distance of the hermitian matrices , we obtain the minimum distance between a bipartite bound entangled $ n$- qudit density matrix and the maximally mixed state.this minimum distance for which entangled density matrices necessarily have positive partial transpose ( ppt ) is obtained as $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sqrt{d^n(d^n-1)}+1}}$ , which is also a lower limit for the existence of 1-distillable entangled states . the separable states necessarily lie within a minimum distance of $ \frac{r}{1+d^{n-1}}$ from the identity , where r is the radius of the closed ball homeomorphic to the set of density matrices , which is lesser than the limit for the limit for ppt bound entangled states . furthermore an alternate proof on the non - emptiness of the ppt bound entangled states has also been given .
