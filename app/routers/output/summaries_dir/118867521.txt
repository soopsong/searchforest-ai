by using a condition of average trace preservation we derive a general class of non - markovian gaussian diffusive unravelings [ l. diosi and l. ferialdi , phys . rev . lett . \textbf{113 } , 200403 ( 2014 ) ] , here valid for arbitrary non - hermitian system operators and noise correlations . the conditions under which the generalized stochastic schrodinger equation has the same symmetry properties ( invariance under unitary changes of operator base ) than a microscopic system - bath hamiltonian dynamics are determined . while the standard quantum diffusion model ( standard noise correlations ) always share the same invariance symmetry , the generalized stochastic dynamics can be mapped with an arbitrary bosonic environment only if some specific correlation constraints are fulfilled . these features are analyzed for different non - markovian unravelings equivalent in average . results based on quantum measurement theory that lead to specific cases of the generalized dynamics [ j. gambetta and h. m. wiseman , phys . rev . a \textbf{66 } , 012108 ( 2002)]\ are studied from the perspective of the present analysis .
