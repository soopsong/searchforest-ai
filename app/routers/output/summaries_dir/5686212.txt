the memristor is the fundamental non - linear circuit element , with uses in computing and computer memory . reram ( resistive random access memory ) is a resistive switching memory proposed as a non - volatile memory . in this review we shall summarise the state of the art for these closely - related fields , concentrating on titanium dioxide , the well - utilised and archetypal material for both . we shall cover material properties , switching mechanisms and models to demonstrate what reram and memristor scientists can learn from each other and examine the outlook for these technologies .
