we describe $ \omega$-limit sets of completely positive ( cp ) maps over finite - dimensional spaces . in such sets and in its corresponding convex hulls , cp maps present isometric behavior and the states contained in it commute with each other . motivated by these facts , we describe a quantization procedure based on cp maps which are induced by markov ( transfer ) operators . classical dynamics are described by an action over essentially bounded functions . a non - expansive linear map , which depends on a choice of a probability measure , is the centerpiece connecting phenomena over function and matrix spaces .
