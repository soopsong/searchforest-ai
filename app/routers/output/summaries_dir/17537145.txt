as an ensemble scheme of solid - state nmr quantum computers the extension of kane 's many - qubits silicon scheme based on the array of 31 p donor atoms are spaced lengthwise of the strip gates is considered . the possible planar topology of such ensemble quantum computer is suggested . the estimation of the output nmr signal was performed and it was shown that for the number n>=10 ^ 5 of ensemble elements involving l~10 ^ 3 qubits each , the standard nmr methods are usable . as main mechanisms of decoherence for low temperature ( < 0.1k ) , the adiabatic processes of random modulation of qubit resonance frequency determined by secular part of nuclear spin hyperfine interaction with electron magnetic moment of basic atom and dipole - dipole interaction with nuclear moments of neighboring impurity atoms was considered , it was made estimations of allowed concentrations of magnetic impurities and of spin temperature whereby the required decoherence suppression is obtained . semiclassical decoherence model of two qubit entangled states is also presented . as another variant of the solid - state ensemble quantum computer , the gateless architecture of cellular - automaton with antiferromagnetically ordered electron spins is also discussed here .
