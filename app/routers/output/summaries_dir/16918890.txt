several finite dimensional quasi - probability representations of quantum states have been proposed to study various problems in quantum information theory and quantum foundations . these representations are often defined only on restricted dimensions and their physical significance in contexts such as drawing quantum - classical comparisons is limited by the non - uniqueness of the particular representation . here we show how the mathematical theory of frames provides a unified formalism which accommodates all known quasi - probability representations of finite dimensional quantum systems . moreover , we show that any quasi - probability representation satisfying two reasonable properties is equivalent to a frame representation and then prove that any such representation of quantum mechanics must exhibit either negativity or a deformed probability calculus .
