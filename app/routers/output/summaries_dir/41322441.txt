we study on the tripartite entanglement dynamics when each party is initially entangled with other parties , but they locally interact with their own non - markovian environment . first , we consider three ghz - type initial states , all of which have ghz symmetry provided that the parameters are chosen appropriately . however , this symmetry is broken due to the effect of environment . the corresponding $ \pi$-tangles , one of the tripartite entanglement measure , are analytically computed at arbitrary time . the revival phenomenon of entanglement occurs after complete disappearance of entanglement . we also consider two w - type initial states . the revival phenomenon also occurs in this case . on the analytical ground the robustness issue against the effect of environment is examined for both ghz - type and w - type initial states .
