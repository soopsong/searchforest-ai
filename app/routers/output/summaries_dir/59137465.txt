inconclusive photon subtraction ( ips ) is a conditional measurement scheme to force nonlinear evolution of a given state . in ips the input state is mixed with the vacuum in a beam splitter and then the reflected beam is revealed by on / off photodetection . when the detector clicks we have the ( inconclusive ) photon subtracted state . we show that ips on both channels of an entangled twin - beam of radiation improves the fidelity of coherent state teleportation if the energy of the incoming twin - beam is below a certain threshold , which depends on the beam splitter transmissivity and the quantum efficiency of photodetectors . we show that the energy threshold diverges when the transmissivity and the efficiency approach unit and compare our results with that of previous works on { \em conclusive } photon subtraction .
