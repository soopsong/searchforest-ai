we study self - excited oscillations ( seo ) in an on - fiber optomechanical cavity . synchronization is observed when the optical power that is injected into the cavity is periodically modulated . a theoretical analysis based on the fokker - planck equation evaluates the expected phase space distribution ( psd ) of the self - oscillating mechanical resonator . a tomography technique is employed for extracting psd from the measured reflected optical power . time - resolved state tomography measurements are performed to study phase diffusion and phase locking of the seo . the detuning region inside which synchronization occurs is experimentally determined and the results are compared with the theoretical prediction .
