the influence of noise and of unruh effect on quantum prisoners ' dilemma is investigated both for entangled and unentangled initial states . the noise is incorporated through amplitude damping channel . for unentangled initial state , the decoherence compensates for the adverse effect of acceleration of the frame and the effect of acceleration becomes irrelevant provided the game is fully decohered . it is shown that the inertial player always out scores the noninertial player by choosing defection . for maximally entangled initially state , we show that for fully decohered case every strategy profile results in either of the two possible equilibrium outcomes . two of the four possible strategy profiles become pareto optimal and nash equilibrium and no dilemma is leftover . it is shown that other equilibrium points emerge for different region of values of decoherence parameter that are either pareto optimal or pareto inefficient in the quantum strategic spaces . it is shown that the eisert et al miracle move is a special move that leads always to distinguishable results compare to other moves . we show that the dilemma like situation is resolved in favor of one player or the other .
