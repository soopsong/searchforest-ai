tsallis-$q$ entanglement is a bipartite entanglement measure which is the generalization of entanglement of formation for $ q$ tending to 1 . we first expand the range of $ q$ for the analytic formula of tsallis-\emph{q } entanglement . for $ \frac{5-\sqrt{13}}{2 } \leq \emph{q } \leq \frac{5+\sqrt{13}}{2}$ , we prove the monogamy relation in terms of the squared tsallis-$q$ entanglement for an arbitrary multi - qubit systems . it is shown that the multipartite entanglement indicator based on squared tsallis-$q$ entanglement still works well even when the indicator based on the squared concurrence loses its efficacy . we also show that the $ \mu$-th power of tsallis-\emph{q } entanglement satisfies the monogamy or polygamy inequalities for any three - qubit state .
