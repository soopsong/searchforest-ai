we consider an atom in its ground state undergoing a non - relativistic oscillation in free space . the interaction with the electromagnetic quantum vacuum leads to two effects to leading order in perturbation theory . when the mechanical frequency is larger than the atomic transition frequency , the dominant effect is the motion - induced transition to an excited state with the emission of a photon carrying the excess energy . we compute the angular distribution of emitted photons and the excitation rate . on the other hand , when the mechanical frequency is smaller than the transition frequency , the leading - order effect is the parametric emission of photon pairs , which constitutes the microscopic counterpart of the dynamical casimir effect . we discuss the properties of the microscopic dynamical casimir effect and build a connection with the photon production by an oscillating macroscopic metallic mirror .
