quantum states that can yield work in a cyclical hamiltonian process form one of the primary resources in the context of quantum thermodynamics . conversely , states whose average energy can not be lowered by unitary transformations are called passive . however , while work may be extracted from non - passive states using arbitrary unitaries , the latter may be hard to realize in practice . it is therefore pertinent to consider the passivity of states under restricted classes of operations that can be feasibly implemented . here , we ask how restrictive the class of gaussian unitaries is for the task of work extraction . we investigate the notion of gaussian passivity , that is , we present necessary and sufficient criteria identifying all states whose energy can not be lowered by gaussian unitaries . for all other states we give a prescription for the gaussian operations that extract the maximal amount of energy . finally , we show that the gap between passivity and gaussian passivity is maximal , i.e. , gaussian - passive states may still have a maximal amount of energy that is extractable by arbitrary unitaries , even under entropy constraints .
