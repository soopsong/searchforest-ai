we present and investigate an analogue model for a controllable photon geberation via the dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) in a cavity containing a degenerate optical amplifier ( opa ) which is pumed by an amplitude - modulated field . the time modulation of the pump field in the model opa system is equivalent to a periodic modulation of the cavity length , which is responsible for the generation of the casimir radiation . by taking into account the rapidly oscillating terms of the modulation frequency , the effects of the corresponding counter - rotating terms ( crts ) on the analogue casimir radiation emerge clearly . we find that the mean number of generated photons and their quantum statistical properties exhibit oscillatory behaviors , which are controllable through the modulation frequency as an external control parameter.we also recognize a new phenomenon , the so - called"anti - dce,"in which pair photons can be coherently annihilated due to the time - modulated pumping . we show that the casimir radiation exhibits quadrature squeezing , photon bunching and super - poissonian statistics which are controllable by modulation frequency . we also calculate the power spectrum of the intracavity light field . we find that the appearance of the side bands in the spectrum is due to the presence of the crts .
