we describe an easy - to - implement technique that allows for a complete experimental characterization of sub - wavelength diameter tapered optical fibers . our method is based on a direct and fast numerical analysis of the backward brillouin spectrum measured using a highly sensitive single - ended heterodyne coherent detection . it can be performed in situ without any manipulation nor optical alignment of optical microfibers . sensitivity as high as a few nanometer for fiber diameter ranging from 500 nm to 1.2 micron is reported . this new method may help for the design and characterization of optical fiber tapers widely used in many applications such as optical sensing , atom trapping , quantum optics , and plasmonics .
