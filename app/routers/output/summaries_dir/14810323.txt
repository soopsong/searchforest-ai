we study the quantum rabi model within the framework of the analytical solution developed in phys . rev . lett . 107,100401 ( 2011 ) . in particular , through time - dependent correlation functions , we give a quantitative criterion for classifying two regions of the quantum rabi model , involving the jaynes - cummings , the ultrastrong , and deep strong coupling regimes . in addition , we find a stationary qubit - field entangled basis that governs the whole dynamics as the coupling strength overcomes the mode frequency .
