using the model of parametric interaction based on the spatio - spectral schmidt modes and generalized parametric approximation , we analyze coherence and mode structure of ultra - intense twin beams generated in the regime with pump depletion . we show that the increase of spatial and spectral coherence with the increasing pump power observed for moderate powers is replaced by the decrease for the pump powers at which pump depletion occurs . this behavior of coherence is opposed to that exhibited by the number of spatio - spectral modes effectively constituting the twin beam . the conditions for maximal coherence are analyzed considering pump - beam parameters ( spectral width , transverse radius ) . the existence of additional coherence maxima occurring at even higher pump powers is predicted and explained by the oscillatory evolution of the modes ' populations .
