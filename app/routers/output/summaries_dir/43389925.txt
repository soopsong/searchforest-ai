we show that , for arbitrary quantum feedback networks consisting of several quantum mechanical components connected by quantum fields , the limit of adiabatic elimination of fast oscillator modes in the components and the limit of instantaneous transmission along internal quantum field connections commute . the underlying technique is to show that both limits involve a schur complement procedure . the result shows that the frequently used approximations , for instance to eliminate strongly coupled optical cavities , are mathematically consistent .
