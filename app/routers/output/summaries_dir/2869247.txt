robust control design for quantum systems has been recognized as a key task in the development of practical quantum technology . in this paper , we present a systematic numerical methodology of sampling - based learning control ( slc ) for control design of quantum systems with hamiltonian uncertainties . the slc method includes two steps of"training"and"testing and evaluation " . in the training step , an augmented system is constructed by sampling uncertainties according to possible distributions of uncertainty parameters . a gradient flow based learning and optimization algorithm is adopted to find the control for the augmented system . in the process of testing and evaluation , a number of samples obtained through sampling the uncertainties are tested to evaluate the control performance . numerical results demonstrate the success of the slc approach . the slc method has potential applications for robust control design of quantum systems .
