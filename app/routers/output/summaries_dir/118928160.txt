we report the realization of an elementary quantum processor based on a linear crystal of trapped ions . each ion serves as a quantum bit ( qubit ) to store the quantum information in long lived electronic states . we present the realization of single - qubit and of universal two - qubit logic gates . the qwo - qubit operation relies on the coupling of the ions through their collective quantized motion . a detailed description of the setup and the methods is included .
