we develop a time - non - local ( tnl ) formalism based on variational calculus , which allows for the analysis of tnl lagrangians . we derive the generalized euler - lagrange equations starting from the hamilton 's principle and , by defining a generalized momentum , we introduce the corresponding hamiltonian formalism . we apply the formalism to second order tnl lagrangians and we show that it reproduces standard results in the time - local limit . an example will show how the formalism works , and will provide an interesting insight on the non - standard features of tnl equations .
