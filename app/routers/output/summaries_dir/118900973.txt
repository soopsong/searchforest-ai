we present an information geometric characterization of grover 's quantum search algorithm . first , we quantify the notion of quantum distinguishability between parametric density operators by means of the wigner - yanase quantum information metric . we then show that the quantum searching problem can be recast in an information geometric framework where grover 's dynamics is characterized by a geodesic on the manifold of the parametric density operators of pure quantum states constructed from the continuous approximation of the parametric quantum output state in grover 's algorithm . we also discuss possible deviations from grover 's algorithm within this quantum information geometric setting .
