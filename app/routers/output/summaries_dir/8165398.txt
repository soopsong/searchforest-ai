adiabatic quantum optimization offers a new method for solving hard optimization problems . in this paper we calculate median adiabatic times ( in seconds ) determined by the minimum gap during the adiabatic quantum optimization for an np - hard ising spin glass instance class with up to 128 binary variables . using parameters obtained from a realistic superconducting adiabatic quantum processor , we extract the minimum gap and matrix elements using high performance quantum monte carlo simulations on a large - scale internet - based computing platform . we compare the median adiabatic times with the median running times of two classical solvers and find that , for the considered problem sizes , the adiabatic times for the simulated processor architecture are about 4 and 6 orders of magnitude shorter than the two classical solvers ' times . this shows that if the adiabatic time scale were to determine the computation time , adiabatic quantum optimization would be significantly superior to those classical solvers for median spin glass problems of at least up to 128 qubits . we also discuss important additional constraints that affect the performance of a realistic system .
