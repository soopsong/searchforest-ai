we present a theoretical scheme for ground state cooling of a mechanical resonator in a membrane - in - middle optomechanical system ( oms ) driven by two red - detuned drive fields . the details of dynamical evolution of oms are provided , and the effect of system conditions on cooling results are systematically studied . most importantly , the setups with two drives are found to be capable of achieving better cooling results than the theoretical cooling limit with single cavity . even an improvement by one order of thermal phonon number is possible with proper combination of the cavity damping rate and drive intensity .
