the purpose of this paper is to study the realization theory of quantum linear systems . it is shown that for a general quantum linear system its controllability and observability are equivalent and they can be checked by means of a simple matrix rank condition . based on controllability and observability a specific realization is proposed for general quantum linear systems in which an uncontrollable and unobservable subspace is identified . when restricted to the passive case , it is found that a realization is minimal if and only if it is hurwitz stable . computational methods are proposed to find the cardinality of minimal realizations of a quantum linear passive system . it is found that the transfer function of a quantum linear passive system $ g$ can be written as a fractional form in terms of a matrix function $ \sigma$ ; moreover , $ g$ is lossless bounded real if and only if $ \sigma$ is lossless positive real . a type of realization for multi - input - multi - output quantum linear passive systems is derived , which is closely related to its controllability and observability decomposition . two realizations , namely the independent - oscillator realization and the chain - mode realization , are proposed for single - input - single - output quantum linear passive systems , and it is shown that under the assumption of minimal realization , the independent - oscillator realization is unique , and these two realizations are related to the lossless positive real matrix function $ \sigma$.
