we analyse a model for fault - tolerant quantum computation with low overhead suitable for situations where the noise is biased . the basis for this scheme is a gadget for the fault - tolerant preparation of magic states that enable universal fault - tolerant quantum computation using only clifford gates that preserve the noise bias . we analyse the distillation of $ |t\rangle$-type magic states using this gadget at the physical level , followed by concatenation with the 15-qubit quantum reed - muller code , and comparing our results with standard constructions . in the regime where the noise bias ( rate of pauli $ z$ errors relative to other single - qubit errors ) is greater than a factor of 10 , our scheme has lower overhead across a broad range of relevant noise rates .
