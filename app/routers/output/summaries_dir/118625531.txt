we study the large deviations of the time - integrated current for a driven diffusion on the circle , often used as a model of nonequilibrium systems . we obtain the large deviation functions describing the current fluctuations using a fourier - bloch decomposition of the so - called tilted generator and also construct from this decomposition the effective ( biased , auxiliary or driven ) markov process describing the diffusion as current fluctuations are observed in time . this effective process provides a clear physical explanation of the various fluctuation regimes observed . it is used here to obtain an upper bound on the current large deviation function , which we compare to a recently - derived entropic bound , and to study the low - noise limit of large deviations .
