we investigate"the wojcik model"introduced and studied by wojcik et al . , which is a one - defect quantum walk ( qw ) having a single phase at the origin . they reported that giving a phase at one point causes an astonishing effect for localization . there are three types of measures having important roles in the study of qws : time - averaged limit measure , weak limit measure , and stationary measure . the first two measures imply a coexistence of localized behavior and the ballistic spreading in the qw . as konno et al . suggested , the time - averaged limit and stationary measures are closely related to each other for some models . in this paper , we focus on a relation between the two measures for the wojcik model . the stationary measure was already obtained by our previous work . here , we get the time - averaged limit measure by several methods . our results show that the stationary measure is a special case of the time - averaged limit measure .
