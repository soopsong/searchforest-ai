we consider a markovian approximation , of weak coupling type , to an open system perturbation involving emission , absorption and scattering by reservoir quanta . the result is the general form for a quantum stochastic flow driven by creation , annihilation and gauge processes . a weak matrix limit is established for the convergence of the interaction - picture unitary to a unitary , adapted quantum stochastic process and of the heisenberg dynamics to the corresponding quantum stochastic flow : the convergence strategy is similar to the quantum functional central limits introduced by accardi , frigerio and lu$^ { [ 1]}$. the principal terms in the dyson series expansions are identified and re - summed after the limit to obtain explicit quantum stochastic differential equations with renormalized coefficients . an extension of the pul\unicode{0xe9 } inequalities$^ { [ 2]}$ allows uniform estimates for the dyson series expansion for both the unitary operator and the heisenberg evolution to be obtained .
