the aim of this paper is to determine quantum master and filter equations for systems coupled to continuous - mode single photon fields . the system and field are described using a quantum stochastic unitary model , where the continuous - mode single photon state for the field is determined by a wavepacket pulse shape . the master equation is derived from this model and is given in terms of a system of coupled equations . the output field carries information about the system from the scattered photon , and is continuously monitored . the quantum filter is determined with the aid of an embedding of the system into a larger system , and is given by a system of coupled stochastic differential equations . an example is provided to illustrate the main results .
