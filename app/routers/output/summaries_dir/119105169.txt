recently it has been demonstrated that the combination of weak - continuous position detection with detuned parametric driving can lead to significant steady - state mechanical squeezing , far beyond the 3 db limit normally associated with parametric driving . in this work , we show the close connection between this detuned scheme and quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement of a single mechanical quadrature . in particular , we show that applying an experimentally realistic detuned parametric drive to a cavity optomechanical system allows one to effectively realize a qnd measurement despite being in the bad - cavity limit . in the limit of strong squeezing , we show that this scheme offers significant advantages over standard backaction evasion , not only by allowing operation in the weak measurement and low efficiency regimes , but also in terms of the purity of the mechanical state .
