we consider a system of an arbitrary number of \textsc{1d } linear schr\"odinger equations on a bounded interval with bilinear control . we prove global exact controllability in large time of these $ n$ equations with a single control . this result is valid for an arbitrary potential with generic assumptions on the dipole moment of the considered particle . thus , even in the case of a single particle , this result extends the available literature . the proof combines local exact controllability around finite sums of eigenstates , proved with coron 's return method , a global approximate controllability property , proved with lyapunov strategy , and a compactness argument .
