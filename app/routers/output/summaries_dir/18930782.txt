toeplitz matrices have applications to different problems of statistical mechanics . recently it was used for calculation of entanglement entropy in spin chains . in the paper we review these recent developments . we use the fisher - hartwig formula , as well as the recent results concerning the asymptotics of the block toeplitz determinants , to calculate entanglement entropy of large block of spins in the ground state of xy spin chain .
