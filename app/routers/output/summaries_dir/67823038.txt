we analyze how imperfections in single - photon detectors impact the characterization of photon - pair sources . we perform exact calculations to reveal the effects of multi - pair emissions and of noisy , non - unit efficiency , non photon - number resolving detections on the cauchy - schwarz parameter , on the second order auto - correlation and cross - correlation functions , and on the visibilities of both hong - ou - mandel and bell - like interferences . we consider sources producing either two - mode squeezed states or states with a poissonian photon distribution . the proposed formulas are useful in practice to determine the impacts of multi - pair emissions and dark counts in standard tests used in quantum optics .
