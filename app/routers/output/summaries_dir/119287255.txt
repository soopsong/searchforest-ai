the propagation of polarization - entangled states of light through fluctuating loss channels in the turbulent atmosphere is studied , including the situation of strong losses . we consider violations of bell inequalities by light , emitted by a parametric down - conversion source , after transmission through the turbulent atmosphere . it is shown by analytical calculations , that in the presence of background radiation and dark counts , fluctuating loss channels may preserve entanglement properties of light even better than standard loss channels , when postselected measurements are applied .
