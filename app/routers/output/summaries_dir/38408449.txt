when searching for a marked vertex in a graph , szegedy 's usual search operator is defined by using the transition probability matrix of the random walk with absorbing barriers at the marked vertices . instead of using this operator , we analyze searching with szegedy 's quantum walk by using reflections around the marked vertices , that is , the standard form of quantum query . we show we can boost the probability to 1 of finding a marked vertex in the complete graph . numerical simulations suggests that the success probability can be improved for other graphs , like the two - dimensional grid . we also prove that , for a certain class of graphs , we can express szegedy 's search operator , obtained from the absorbing walk , using the standard query model .
