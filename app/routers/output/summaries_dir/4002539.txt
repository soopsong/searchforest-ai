emission linewidth is an important figure of merit for masers and lasers . we recently demonstrated a semiconductor double quantum dot ( dqd ) micromaser where photons are generated through single electron tunneling events . charge noise directly couples to the dqd energy levels , resulting in a maser linewidth that is more than 100 times larger than the schawlow - townes prediction . here we demonstrate a linewidth narrowing of more than a factor 10 by locking the dqd emission to a coherent tone that is injected to the input port of the cavity . we measure the injection locking range as a function of cavity input power and show that it is in agreement with the adler equation . the position and amplitude of distortion sidebands that appear outside of the injection locking range are quantitatively examined . our results show that this unconventional maser , which is impacted by strong charge noise and electron - phonon coupling , is well described by standard laser models .
