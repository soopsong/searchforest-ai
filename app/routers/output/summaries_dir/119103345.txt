we show that any bell local state , with a hidden nonlocality that can be revealed by local filtering , is more , or equally , entangled than nonlocal states . more precisely , it can be deterministically transformed into a nonlocal state , by local operations and classical communication . for such a state , there is a clear anomaly of nonlocality , for any measures of entanglement and nonlocality . moreover , we prove that the hidden nonlocality of any bipartite state more , or equally , entangled than nonlocal states , can be revealed by local operations and the sending of two one - bit messages , one in each direction . for some particular states , one bit of communication is even enough .
