blind quantum computing enables a client , who can only generate or measure single - qubit states , to delegate quantum computing to a remote quantum server in such a way that the input , output , and program are hidden from the server . it is an open problem whether a completely classical client can delegate quantum computing blindly . in this paper , we show that if a completely classical client can blindly delegate sampling of subuniversal models , such as the dqc1 model and the iqp model , then the polynomial - time hierarchy collapses to the third level . our delegation protocol is the one where the client first sends a polynomial - length bit string to the server and then the server returns a single bit to the client . generalizing the no - go result to more general setups is an open problem .
