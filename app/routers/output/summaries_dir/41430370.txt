with the advent of public access to small gate - based quantum processors , it becomes necessary to develop a benchmarking methodology such that independent researchers can validate the operation of these processors . we explore the usefulness of a number of simple quantum circuits as benchmarks for gate - based quantum computing devices and show that circuits performing identity operations are very simple , scalable and sensitive to gate errors and are therefore very well suited for this task . we illustrate the procedure by presenting benchmark results for the ibm quantum experience , a cloud - based platform for gate - based quantum computing .
