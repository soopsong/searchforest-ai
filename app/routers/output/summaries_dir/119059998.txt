the precise estimation of the gravitational acceleration is important for various disciplines . we consider making such an estimation using quantum optics . a mach - zehnder interferometer in an"optical fountain"type arrangement is considered and used to define a standard quantum limit for estimating the gravitational acceleration . we use an approach based on quantum field theory on a curved , schwarzschild metric background to calculate the coupling between the gravitational field and the optical signal . the analysis is extended to include the injection of a squeezed vacuum to the mach - zehnder arrangement and also to consider an active , two - mode su(1,1 ) interferometer in a similar arrangement . when detection loss is larger than $ 8\%$ , the su(1,1 ) interferometer shows an advantage over the mz interferometer with single - mode squeezing input . the proposed system is based on current technology and could be used to examine the intersection of quantum theory and general relativity as well as for possible applications .
