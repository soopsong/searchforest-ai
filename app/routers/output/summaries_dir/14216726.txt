we propose an approach to the study of open quantum systems based on a parametric representation of the principal system . the representation is obtained introducing generalized coherent states for the environment , and is such that the evolution from a fully quantum environment to a classical one can be inherently followed . the method is applied to the specific case where the principal system is a central qubit and the environment is a surrounding ring of interacting spins , with the overall hamiltonian being that of the $ s=1/2 $ heisenberg star with frustration . in this case the quantum character of the environment , embodied by the total spin $ s$ of the ring , can be physically varied by acting on the ratio between the couplings entering the hamiltonian , and formally followed by increasing $ s$. we find that when the star is in any of its eigenstates , the qubit behaves as if it were under the effect of an external magnetic field , whose direction in real space is set by the variables defining the environmental coherent states , and is hence broadened according to their quantum probability distribution . when the quantum character of the environment is reduced , such distribution becomes narrower , finally collapsing into a dirac-$\delta$ as $ s\to\infty$. the entanglement between the central qubit and its environment remains well defined even in this limit , where it comes across as the binary entropy of the $ 2\pi$-normalized berry phase characterizing the dynamics of a qubit in an adiabatically precessing magnetic field .
