we study synchronization of two dissipatively coupled van der pol oscillators in the quantum regime . due to quantum noise strict frequency locking is absent and is replaced by a crossover from weak to strong frequency entrainment . we discuss the differences to the behavior of one quantum van der pol oscillator subject to an external drive . moreover , we describe a possible experimental realization of two coupled quantum van der pol oscillators in an optomechanical setting .
