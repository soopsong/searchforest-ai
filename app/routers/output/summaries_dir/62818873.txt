it is a general fact that the coupling constant of an interacting many - body hamiltonian do not correspond to any observable and one has to infer its value by an indirect measurement . for this purpose , quantum systems at criticality can be considered as a resource to improve the ultimate quantum limits to precision of the estimation procedure . in this paper , we consider the one - dimensional quantum ising model as a paradigmatic example of many - body system exhibiting criticality , and derive the optimal quantum estimator of the coupling constant varying size and temperature . we find the optimal external field , which maximizes the quantum fisher information of the coupling constant , both for few spins and in the thermodynamic limit , and show that at the critical point a precision improvement of order $ l$ is achieved . we also show that the measurement of the total magnetization provides optimal estimation for couplings larger than a threshold value , which itself decreases with temperature .
