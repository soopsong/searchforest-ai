in order to deal with ir divergences arising in qed or perturbative quantum gravity scattering processes , one can either calculate inclusive quantities or use dressed asymptotic states . we consider incoming superpositions of momentum eigenstates and show that in calculations of cross - sections these two approaches yield different answers : in the inclusive formalism no interference occurs for incoming finite superpositions and wavepackets do not scatter at all , while the dressed formalism yields the expected interference terms . this suggests that rather than fock space states , one should use faddeev - kulish - type dressed states to correctly describe physical processes involving incoming superpositions . we interpret this in terms of selection rules due to large u(1 ) gauge symmetries and bms supertranslations .
