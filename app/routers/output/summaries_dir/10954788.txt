in this paper we study the one dimensional dynamical casimir effect . we consider a one dimensional cavity formed by two mirrors , one of which performs an oscillatory motion with a frequency resonant with the cavity . the naive solution , perturbative in powers of the amplitude , contains secular terms . therefore it is valid only in the short time limit . using a renormalization group technique to resum these terms , we obtain an improved analytical solution which is valid for longer times . we discuss the generation of peaks in the density energy profile and show that the total energy inside the cavity increases exponentially .
