we demonstrate superconducting nanowire single photon detectors with 76 + /- 4 % system detection efficiency at a wavelength of 315 nm and an operating temperature of 3.2 k , with a background count rate below 1 count per second at saturated detection efficiency . we propose integrating these detectors into planar surface electrode radio - frequency paul traps for use in trapped ion quantum information processing . we operate detectors integrated into test ion trap structures at 3.8 k both with and without typical radio - frequency trapping electric fields . the trapping fields reduce system detection efficiency by 9 % , but do not increase background count rates .
