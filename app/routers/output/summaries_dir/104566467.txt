universal control of quantum systems is a major goal to be achieved for quantum information processing , which demands thorough understanding of fundamental quantum mechanics and promises applications of quantum technologies . so far , most studies concentrate on ideally isolated quantum systems governed by unitary evolutions , while practical quantum systems are open and described by quantum channels due to their inevitable coupling to environment . here , we experimentally simulate arbitrary quantum channels for an open quantum system , i.e. a single photonic qubit in a superconducting quantum circuit . the arbitrary channel simulation is achieved with minimum resource of only one ancilla qubit and measurement - based adaptive control . by repetitively implementing the quantum channel simulation , we realize an arbitrary liouvillian for a continuous evolution of an open quantum system for the first time . our experiment provides not only a testbed for understanding quantum noise and decoherence , but also a powerful tool for full control of practical open quantum systems .
