synthesizing an effective identity evolution in a target system subjected to unwanted unitary or non - unitary dynamics is a fundamental task for both quantum control and quantum information processing applications . here , we investigate how single - bit , discrete - time feedback capabilities may be exploited to enact or to enhance quantum procedures for effectively suppressing unwanted dynamics in a finite - dimensional open quantum system . an explicit characterization of the joint unitary propagators correctable by a single - bit feedback strategy for arbitrary evolution time is obtained . for a two - dimensional target system , we show how by appropriately combining quantum feedback with dynamical decoupling methods , concatenated feedback - decoupling schemes may be built , which can operate under relaxed control assumptions and can outperform purely closed - loop and open - loop protocols .
