we consider quantum spin systems defined on finite sets $ v$ equipped with a metric . in typical examples , $ v$ is a large , but finite subset of z^d . for finite range hamiltonians with uniformly bounded interaction terms and a unique , gapped ground state , we demonstrate a locality property of the corresponding ground state projector . in such systems , this ground state projector can be approximated by the product of observables with quantifiable supports . in fact , given any subset , x , of v the ground state projector can be approximated by the product of two projections , one supported on x and one supported on x^c , and a bounded observable supported on a boundary region in such a way that as the boundary region increases , the approximation becomes better . such an approximation was useful in proving an area law in one dimension , and this result corresponds to a multi - dimensional analogue .
