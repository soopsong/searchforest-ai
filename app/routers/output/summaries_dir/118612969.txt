we analyze the evolution of the gaussian discord between two resonant harmonic oscillators coupled to a common environment . for this , we use the same tools we applied before to fully characterize the evolution of the entanglement in this system [ phys . rev . lett . 100 220401 ( 2008 ) ] . the asymptotic value of gaussian discord is obtained as a function of parameters characterizing the environment ( temperature , couplings , etc . ) and the initial state of the system ( initial squeezing , initial purity , etc . ) the type of gaussian measurement optimizing the extraction of information between the oscillators is fully characterized by means of a phase diagram . such a diagram ( with phases corresponding to homodyne or heterodyne measurements ) has similar topology to the one describing dynamical phases for the entanglement . we present evidence pointing to the fact that gaussian discord is not always a good approximation of true discord as the asymptotic value of the former is shown to be a nondecreasing function of temperature ( in the high - temperature regime ) , reaching an asymptotic value of log(2 ) for a pure initial state ( and lower values for mixed initial states ) .
