a major advantage in using szegedy 's formalism over discrete - time and continuous - time quantum walks lies in its ability to define a unitary quantum walk on directed and weighted graphs . in this paper , we present a general scheme to construct efficient quantum circuits for szegedy quantum walks that correspond to classical markov chains possessing transformational symmetry in the columns of the transition matrix . in particular , the transformational symmetry criteria do not necessarily depend on the sparsity of the transition matrix , so this scheme can be applied to non - sparse markov chains . two classes of markov chains that are amenable to this construction are cyclic permutations and complete bipartite graphs , for which we provide explicit efficient quantum circuit implementations . we also prove that our scheme can be applied to markov chains formed by a tensor product . we also briefly discuss the implementation of markov chains based on weighted interdependent networks . in addition , we apply this scheme to construct efficient quantum circuits simulating the szegedy walks used in the quantum pagerank algorithm for some classes of non - trivial graphs , providing a necessary tool for experimental demonstration of the quantum pagerank algorithm .
