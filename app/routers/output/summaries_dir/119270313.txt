adaptive techniques have important potential for wide applications in enhancing precision of quantum parameter estimation . we present a recursively adaptive quantum state tomography ( raqst ) protocol for finite dimensional quantum systems and experimentally implement the adaptive tomography protocol on two - qubit systems . in this raqst protocol , an adaptive measurement strategy and a recursive linear regression estimation algorithm are performed . numerical results show that our raqst protocol can outperform the tomography protocols using mutually unbiased bases ( mub ) and the two - stage mub adaptive strategy even with the simplest product measurements . when nonlocal measurements are available , our raqst can beat the gill - massar bound for a wide range of quantum states with a modest number of copies . we use only the simplest product measurements to implement two - qubit tomography experiments . in the experiments , we use error - compensation techniques to tackle systematic error due to misalignments and imperfection of wave plates , and achieve about 100-fold reduction of the systematic error . the experimental results demonstrate that the improvement of raqst over nonadaptive tomography is significant for states with a high level of purity . our results also show that this recursively adaptive tomography method is particularly effective for the reconstruction of maximally entangled states , which are important resources in quantum information .
