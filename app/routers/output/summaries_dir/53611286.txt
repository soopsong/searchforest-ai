we demonstrate that the open quantum rabi model ( qrm ) exhibits a second - order dissipative phase transition ( dpt ) and propose a method to observe this transition with trapped ions . the interplay between the ultrastrong qubit - oscillator coupling and the oscillator damping brings the system into a steady - state with a diverging number of excitations , in which a dpt is allowed to occur even with a finite number of system components . the universality class of the open qrm , modified from the closed qrm by a markovian bath , is identified by finding critical exponents and scaling functions using the keldysh functional integral approach . we propose to realize the open qrm with two trapped ions where the coherent coupling and the rate of dissipation can be individually controlled and adjusted over a wide range . thanks to this controllability , our work opens a possibility to investigate potentially rich dynamics associated with a dissipative phase transition .
