we study the spatial mode content at the output of a wide - field su(1,1 ) interferometer , i.e. a nonlinear interferometer comprising two coherently - pumped spatially - multimode optical parametric amplifiers placed in sequence with a focusing element in between . this device is expected to provide a phase sensitivity below the shot - noise limit for multiple modes over a broad angular range . to reconstruct the spatial modes and their weights , we implement a simple method based on the acquisition of only intensity distributions . the eigenmode decomposition of the field is obtained through the measurement of the covariance of intensities at different spatial points . we investigate both the radial and azimuthal ( orbital angular momentum ) modes and show that their total number is large enough to enable applications of the interferometer in spatially - resolved phase measurements .
