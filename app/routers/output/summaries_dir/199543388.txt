in this work we construct wigner functions for hybrid continuous and discrete variable quantum systems . we demonstrate new capabilities in the visualization of the interactions and correlations within hybrid quantum systems . specifically , we show how to clearly distinguish signatures that arise due to quantum and classical correlations in an entangled bell - cat state . we further show how correlations are manifested in different types of interaction , leading to a deeper understanding of how quantum information is shared between two subsystems . understanding the nature of the correlations between systems is central to harnessing quantum effects for information processing ; the methods presented here reveal the nature of these correlations , allowing a clear visualization of the quantum information present in hybrid quantum systems . the methods presented here could be viewed as a form of quantum state spectroscopy .
