we consider the ( renyi ) mutual information , $ i^{(n)}(a , b ) = s^{(n)}_a+s^{(n)}_{b } - s^{(n)}_{a \cup b}$ , of distant compact spatial regions a and b in the vacuum state of a free scalar field . the distance r between a and b is much greater than their sizes $ r_{a , b}$. it is known that $ i^{(n)}(a , b ) \sim c^{(n)}_{ab } \left<0| \phi(r)\phi(0 ) |0\right>^2 $ . we obtain the direct expression of $ c^{(n)}_{ab}$ for arbitrary regions a and b. we perform the analytical continuation of $ n$ and obtain the mutual information . the direct expression is useful for the numerical computation . by using the direct expression , we can compute directly $ i(a , b)$ without computing $ s_a , s_b$ and $ s_{a \cup b}$ respectively , so it reduces significantly the amount of computation .
