we study the assisted adiabatic passage , and equivalently the transitionless quantum driving , as a quantum brachistochrone trajectory . the optimal hamiltonian for given constraints is constructed from the quantum brachistochrone equation . we discuss how the adiabatic passage is realized as the solution of the equation . the formulation of the quantum brachistochrone is based on the principle of least action . we utilize it to discuss the stability of the adiabatic passage .
