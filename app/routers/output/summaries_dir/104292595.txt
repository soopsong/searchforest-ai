we theoretically investigate the super- and sub - radiance from the resonant dipole - dipole interactions ( rddi ) in a confined two - dimensional ( 2d ) reservoir . the distinctive feature of 2d rddi shows qualitatively and quantitatively different long - range behavior from rddi in free space . we investigate the superradiant properties of the singly - excited symmetric state under this 2d rddi . this state also allows subradiant decays in much longer distances than the transition wavelength , showing long - range atom - atom correlations . we further study the dynamics of the subradiant states which can be accessed by imprinting spatially dependent phases on the atomic arrays . our results demonstrate rich opportunities in engineering light - matter interactions in a confined 2d reservoir , and hold promise in applications of quantum light storage and single - excitation state manipulations .
