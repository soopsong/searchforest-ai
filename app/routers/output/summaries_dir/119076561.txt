recently , various quantum computing and communication tasks have been implemented using ibm 's superconductivity - based quantum computers which are available on the cloud . here , we show that the circuits used in most of those works were not optimized and the use of the optimized circuits can considerably improve the possibility of observing unique features of quantum mechanics . specifically , a systematic procedure is used here to obtain optimized circuits ( circuits having reduced gate count and number of levels ) for a large number of clifford+t circuits which have already been implemented in the ibm quantum computers . optimized circuits implementable in ibm quantum computers are also obtained for a set of reversible benchmark circuits . with a clear example , it is shown that the reduction in circuit costs enhances the fidelity of the output state ( with respect to the theoretically expected state in the absence of noise ) as lesser number of gates and levels introduce lesser amount of errors during evolution of the state . further , considering mermin inequality as an example , it 's shown that the violation of classical limit is enhanced when we use an optimized circuit . thus , the approach adopted here can be used to identify relatively weaker signature of quantumness and also to establish quantum supremacy in a stronger manner .
