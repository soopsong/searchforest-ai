we reveal the existence of a new type of surface electromagnetic waves supported by hyperbolic metasurfaces , described by a conductivity tensor with an indefinite signature . we demonstrate that the spectrum of the hyperbolic metasurface waves consists of two branches corresponding to hybrid te - tm waves with the polarization that varies from linear to elliptic or circular depending on the wave frequency and propagation direction . we analyze the effect of losses of the surface waves and derive the corresponding analytical asymptotic expressions .
