we study both massive and massless particle 's geodesic motion in the background of general dimensional ads - sol space - time . we find that the massive particles oscillate along the radial direction , while massless particles experience one - time bouncing as they approach the"horizon"line of the soliton . our results provide a direct way to understand the negative energy / masses leading to the ads - sol geometry . as a potential application , we extend the point particle to a 3-brane and fix the background as a 5 + 1 dimension ads - sol , thus obtain a very natural bouncing / cyclic cosmological model .
