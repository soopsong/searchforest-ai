the problem of the estimation of multiple phases ( or of commuting unitaries ) is considered . this is a sub - model of the estimation of a completely unknown unitary operation where it has been shown in recent works that there are considerable improvements by using entangled input states and entangled measurements . here it is shown that when estimating commuting unitaries , there is practically no advantage in using entangled input states or entangled measurements .
