recently , consensus - type problems have been formulated in the quantum domain . obtaining average quantum consensus consists in the dynamical symmetrization of a multipartite quantum system while preserving the expectation of a given global observable . in this paper , two improved ways of obtaining consensus via dissipative engineering are introduced , which employ on quasi local preparation of mixtures of symmetric pure states , and show better performance in terms of purity dynamics with respect to existing algorithms . in addition , the first method can be used in combination with simple control resources in order to engineer pure dicke states , while the second method guarantees a stronger type of consensus , namely single - measurement consensus . this implies that outcomes of local measurements on different subsystems are perfectly correlated when consensus is achieved . both dynamics can be randomized and are suitable for feedback implementation .
