we clarify the significance of quasiprobability ( qp ) in quantum mechanics that is relevant in describing physical quantities associated with a transition process . our basic quantity is aharonov 's weak value , from which the qp can be defined up to a certain ambiguity parameterized by a complex number . unlike the conventional probability , the qp allows us to treat two noncommuting observables consistently , and this is utilized to embed the qp in bohmian mechanics such that its equivalence to quantum mechanics becomes more transparent . we also show that , with the help of the qp , bohmian mechanics can be recognized as an ontological model with a certain type of contextuality .
