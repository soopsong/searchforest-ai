we discuss a model comprising two coupled nonlinear oscillators ( kerr - like nonlinear coupler ) with one of them pumped by an external coherent excitation . applying the method of nonlinear quantum scissors we show that the quantum evolution of the coupler can be closed within a finite set of n - photon fock states . moreover , we show that the system is able to generate bell - like states and , as a consequence , the coupler discussed behaves as a two - qubit system . we also analyze the effects of dissipation on entanglement of formation parametrized by concurrence .
