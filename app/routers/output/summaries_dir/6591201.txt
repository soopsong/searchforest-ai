device - independent quantum key distribution is the task of using uncharacterized quantum devices to establish a shared key between two users . if a protocol is secure regardless of the device behaviour , it can be used to generate a shared key even if the supplier of the devices is malicious . to date , all device - independent quantum key distribution protocols that are known to be secure require separate isolated devices for each entangled pair , which is a significant practical limitation . we introduce a protocol that requires alice and bob to have only one device each . although inefficient , our protocol is unconditionally secure against an adversarial supplier limited only by locally enforced signalling constraints .
