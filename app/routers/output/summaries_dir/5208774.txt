the paradigm of extracting work from isolated quantum system through a cyclic hamiltonian process is a topic of immense research interest . the optimal work extracted under such process is termed as ergotropy [ europhys . lett . , 67 ( 4 ) , 565(2004 ) ] . here , in a multi - party scenario we consider only a class of such cyclic processes that can be implemented locally , giving rise to the concept of local ergotropy . eventually , presence of quantum correlations result in a non - vanishing thermodynamic quantity called ergotropic gap , measured by the difference between the global and local ergotropy . however the converse does not hold in general , i.e. its nonzero value does not necessarily imply presence of quantum correlations . for arbitrary multi - party states we quantify this gap . we also evaluate the difference between maximum global and local extractable work for arbitrary states when the system is no longer isolated but put in contact with a baths of same local temperature .
