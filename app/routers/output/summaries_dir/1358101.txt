the difference between faults and errors is that , unlike faults , errors can be corrected using control codes . in classical test and verification one develops a test set separating a correct circuit from a circuit containing any considered fault . classical faults are modelled at the logical level by fault models that act on classical states . the stuck fault model , thought of as a lead connected to a power rail or to a ground , is most typically considered . a classical test set complete for the stuck fault model propagates both binary basis states , 0 and 1 , through all nodes in a network and is known to detect many physical faults . a classical test set complete for the stuck fault model allows all circuit nodes to be completely tested and verifies the function of many gates . it is natural to ask if one may adapt any of the known classical methods to test quantum circuits . of course , classical fault models do not capture all the logical failures found in quantum circuits . the first obstacle faced when using methods from classical test is developing a set of realistic quantum - logical fault models . developing fault models to abstract the test problem away from the device level motivated our study . several results are established . first , we describe typical modes of failure present in the physical design of quantum circuits . from this we develop fault models for quantum binary circuits that enable testing at the logical level . the application of these fault models is shown by adapting the classical test set generation technique known as constructing a fault table to generate quantum test sets . a test set developed using this method is shown to detect each of the considered faults .
