we investigate the entanglement dynamics of continuous - variable quantum channels in terms of an entangled squeezed state of two cavity fields in a general non - markovian environment . using the feynman - vernon influence functional theory in the coherent - state representation , we derive an exact master equation with time - dependent coefficients reflecting the non - markovian influence of the environment . the influence of environments with different spectral densities , e.g. , ohmic , sub - ohmic , and super - ohmic , is numerically studied . the non - markovian process shows its remarkable influences on the entanglement dynamics due to the sensitive time - dependence of the dissipation and noise functions within the typical time scale of the environment . the ohmic environment shows a weak dissipation - noise effect on the entanglement dynamics , while the sub - ohmic and super - ohmic environments induce much more severe noise . in particular , the memory of the system interacting with the environment contributes a strong decoherence effect to the entanglement dynamics in the super - ohmic case .
