the influence of losses in the interferometric generation and the transmission of continuous - variable entangled light is studied , with special emphasis on gaussian states . based on the theory of quantum - state transformation at absorbing dielectric devices , the amount of entanglement is quantified by means of the relative - entropy measure . upper bounds of entanglement and the distance to the set of separable gaussian states are calculated . compared with the distance measure , the bounds can substantially overestimate the entanglement . in particular , they do not show the drastic decrease of entanglement with increasing mean photon number , as does the distance measure .
