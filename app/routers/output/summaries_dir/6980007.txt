we develop a quantum learning scheme for binary discrimination of coherent states of light . this is a problem of technological relevance for the reading of information stored in a digital memory . in our setting , a coherent light source is used to illuminate a memory cell and retrieve its encoded bit by determining the quantum state of the reflected signal . we consider a situation where the amplitude of the states produced by the source is not fully known , but instead this information is encoded in a large training set comprising many copies of the same coherent state . we show that an optimal global measurement , performed jointly over the signal and the training set , provides higher successful identification rates than any learning strategy based on first estimating the unknown amplitude by means of gaussian measurements on the training set , followed by an adaptive discrimination procedure on the signal . by considering a simplified variant of the problem , we argue that this is the case even for non - gaussian estimation measurements . our results show that , even in absence of entanglement , collective quantum measurements yield an enhancement in the readout of classical information , which is particularly relevant in the operating regime of low - energy signals .
