we present a model to describe a generic circuit qed system which consists of multiple artificial three - level atoms , namely qutrits , strongly coupled to a cavity mode . when the state transition of the atoms disobey the selection rules the process that does not conserve the number of excitations can happen determinatively . therefore , we can realize coherent exchange interaction among three or more atoms mediated by the exchange of virtual photons . in addition , we generalize the one cavity mode mediated interactions to the multi - cavity situation , providing a method to entangle atoms located in different cavities . using experimental feasible parameters , we investigate the dynamics of the model including three cyclic - transition three - level atoms , for which the two lowest - energy levels can be treated as qubits . hence , we have found that two qubits can jointly exchange excitation with one qubit in a coherent and reversible way . in the whole process , the population in the third level of atoms is negligible and the cavity photon number is far smaller than 1 . our model provides a feasible scheme to couple multiple distant atoms together , which may find applications in quantum information processing .
