we propose a quantum algorithm for solving combinatorial search problems that uses only a sequence of measurements . the algorithm is similar in spirit to quantum computation by adiabatic evolution , in that the goal is to remain in the ground state of a time - varying hamiltonian . indeed , we show that the running times of the two algorithms are closely related . we also show how to achieve the quadratic speedup for grover 's unstructured search problem with only two measurements . finally , we discuss some similarities and differences between the adiabatic and measurement algorithms .
