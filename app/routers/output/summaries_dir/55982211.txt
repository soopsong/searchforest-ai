we study entanglement entropy ( ee ) as a signature of quantum chaos in ergodic and non - ergodic systems . in particular we look at the quantum kicked top and kicked rotor as multi - qubit systems , and investigate the single qubit ee which characterizes bipartite entanglement of this qubit with the rest of the system . we study the correspondence of the kolmogorov - sinai entropy of the classical kicked systems with the ee of their quantum counterparts . we find that ee is a signature of global chaos in ergodic systems , and local chaos in non - ergodic systems . in particular , we show that ee can be maximised even when systems are highly non - ergodic , when the corresponding classical system is locally chaotic . in contrast , we find evidence that the quantum analogue of kolmogorov - arnol'd - noser ( kam ) tori are tori of low entanglement entropy . we conjecture that entanglement should play an important role in any quantum kam theory .
