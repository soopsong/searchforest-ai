we present a method to apply the well - known matrix product state ( mps ) formalism to partially separable states in solid state systems . the computational effort of our method is equal to the effort of the standard density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) algorithm . consequently , it is applicable to all usually considered condensed matter systems where the dmrg algorithm is successful . we also show in exemplary cases , that polymerisation properties of ground states are closely connected to properties of partial separability , even if the ground state itself is not partially separable .
