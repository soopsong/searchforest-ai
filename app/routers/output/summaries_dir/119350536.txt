we experimentally realize an incoherent microwave source driven by voltage - controlled quantum tunneling of electrons through nanoscale normal - metal -- insulator -- superconductor junctions coupled to a resonator . we observe the direct conversion of the electronic energy into microwave photons by measuring the power spectrum of the microwave radiation emitted from the resonator . the demonstrated total output power exceeds that of 2.5-k thermal radiation although the photon and electron reservoirs are at subkelvin temperatures . measurements of the output power quantitatively agree with a theoretical model in a wide range of the bias voltages providing information on the electrically - controlled photon creation . the developed photon source is fully compatible with low - temperature electronics and offers convenient in - situ electrical control of the photon emission rate with a predetermined frequency , without relying on intrinsic voltage fluctuations of heated normal - metal components nor suffering from unwanted dissipation in room temperature cables . in addition to its potential applications in microwave photonics , our results provide complementary verification of the working principles of the recently discovered quantum - circuit refrigerator .
