holographic quantum matter exhibits an intriguing connection between quantum black holes and more conventional ( albeit strongly interacting ) quantum many - body systems . this connection is manifested in the study of their thermodynamics , statistical mechanics and many - body quantum chaos . after explaining some of those connections and their significance , we focus on the most promising example to date of holographic quantum matter , the family of sachdev - ye - kitaev ( syk ) models . those are simple quantum mechanical models that are thought to realize , holographically , quantum black holes . we review and assess various proposals for experimental realizations of the syk models . such experimental realization offers the exciting prospect of accessing black hole physics , and thus addressing many mysterious questions in quantum gravity , in tabletop experiments .
