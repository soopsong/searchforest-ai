memcomputing is a novel non - turing paradigm of computation that uses interacting memory cells ( memprocessors for short ) to store and process information on the same physical platform . it was recently proved mathematically that memcomputing machines have the same computational power of non - deterministic turing machines . therefore , they can solve np - complete problems in polynomial time and , using the appropriate architecture , with resources that only grow polynomially with the input size . the reason for this computational power stems from properties inspired by the brain and shared by any universal memcomputing machine , in particular intrinsic parallelism and information overhead , namely the capability of compressing information in the collective state of the memprocessor network . here , we show an experimental demonstration of an actual memcomputing architecture that solves the np - complete version of the subset - sum problem in only one step and is composed of a number of memprocessors that scales linearly with the size of the problem . we have fabricated this architecture using standard microelectronic technology so that it can be easily realized in any laboratory setting . even though the particular machine presented here is eventually limited by noise -- and will thus require error - correcting codes to scale to an arbitrary number of memprocessors -- it represents the first proof - of - concept of a machine capable of working with the collective state of interacting memory cells , unlike the present - day single - state machines built using the von neumann architecture .
