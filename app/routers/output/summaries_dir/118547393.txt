single photon detectors are fundamental tools of investigation in quantum optics and play a central role in measurement theory and quantum informatics . photodetectors based on different technologies exist at optical frequencies and much effort is currently being spent on pushing their efficiencies to meet the demands coming from the quantum computing and quantum communication proposals . in the microwave regime however , a single photon detector has remained elusive although several theoretical proposals have been put forth . in this article , we review these recent proposals , especially focusing on non - destructive detectors of propagating microwave photons . these detection schemes using superconducting artificial atoms can reach detection efficiencies of 90\% with existing technologies and are ripe for experimental investigations .
