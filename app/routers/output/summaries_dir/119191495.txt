blind quantum computing is a new secure quantum computing protocol where a client who does not have any sophisticated quantum technlogy can delegate her quantum computing to a server without leaking any privacy . it is known that a client who has only a measurement device can perform blind quantum computing [ t. morimae and k. fujii , phys . rev . a { \bf87 } , 050301(r ) ( 2013 ) ] . it has been an open problem whether the protocol can enjoy the verification , i.e. , the ability of client to check the correctness of the computing . in this paper , we propose a protocol of verification for the measurement - only blind quantum computing .
