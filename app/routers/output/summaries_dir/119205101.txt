we investigate theoretically the coupling of a cavity mode to a continuous distribution of emitters . we discuss the influence of the emitters inhomogeneous broadening on the existence and on the coherence properties of the polaritonic peaks . we find that their coherence depends crucially on the shape of the distribution and not only on its width . under certain conditions the coupling to the cavity protects the polaritonic states from inhomogeneous broadening , resulting in a longer storage time for a quantum memory based on emitters ensembles . when two different ensembles of emitters are coupled to the resonator , they support a peculiar collective dark state , also very attractive for the storage of quantum information .
