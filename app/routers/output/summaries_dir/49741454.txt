in this note we develop the theory of the quantum pontryagin principle for continuous measurements and feedback . the analysis is carried out under the assumption of compatible events in the output channel . the plant is a quantum system , which generally is in a mixed state , coupled to a continuous measurement channel . the pontryagin maximum principle is derived in both the schr\"{o}dinger picture and heisenberg picture , in particular in statistical moment coordinates . to avoid solving stochastic equations we derive a lqg scheme which is more suitable for control purposes .
