decoherence is a fundamental obstacle to the implementation of large - scale and low - noise quantum information processing devices . in this work , we suggest an approach for suppressing errors by employing pre - processing and post - processing unitary operations , which precede and follow the action of a decoherence channel . in contrast to quantum error correction and measurement - based methods , the suggested approach relies on specifically designed unitary operators for a particular state without the need in ancillary qubits or post - selection procedures . we consider the case of decoherence channels acting on a single qubit belonging to a many - qubit state . pre - processing and post - processing operators can be either individual , that is acting on the qubit effected by the decoherence channel only , or collective , that is acting on the whole multi - qubit state . we give a classification of possible strategies for the protection scheme , analyze them , and derive expressions for the optimal unitary operators providing the maximal value of the fidelity regarding initial and final states . specifically , we demonstrate the equivalence of the schemes where one of the unitary operations is individual while the other is collective . we then consider the realization of our approach for the basic decoherence models , which include single - qubit depolarizing , dephasing , and amplitude damping channels . we also demonstrate that the decoherence robustness of multi - qubit states for these decoherence models is determined by the entropy of the reduced state of the qubit undergoing the decoherence channel .
