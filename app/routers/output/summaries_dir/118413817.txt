in quantum optics a pure state is considered classical , relative to the statistics of photodetection , if and only if it is a coherent state . a different and newer notion of nonclassicality is based on modal entanglement . one example that relates these two notions is the hong - ou - mandel effect , where modal entanglement is generated by a beamsplitter from the nonclassical photon - number state . this suggests that beamsplitters or , more generally , linear - optical networks are mediators of the two notions of nonclassicality . in this brief report , we show the following : given a nonclassical pure - product - state input to an n - port linear - optical network , the output is almost always mode entangled ; the only exception is a product of squeezed states , all with the same squeezing strength , input to a network that does not mix the squeezed and anti - squeezed quadratures . our work thus gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a linear network to generate modal entanglement from pure product inputs , a result that is of immediate relevance to the boson sampling problem .
