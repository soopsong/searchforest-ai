an integrated silicon nitride resonator is proposed as an ultra - compact source of bright single - mode quadrature squeezed light at 850 nm . optical properties of the device are investigated and tailored through numerical simulations , with particular attention paid to loss associated with interfacing the device . an asymmetric double layer stack waveguide geometry with inverse vertical tapers is proposed for efficient and robust fibre - chip coupling , yielding a simulated total loss of -0.75 db / facet . we assess the feasibility of the device through a full quantum noise analysis and derive the output squeezing spectrum for intra - cavity pump self - phase modulation . subject to standard material loss and detection efficiencies , we find that the device holds promises for generating substantial quantum noise squeezing over a bandwidth exceeding 1 ghz . in the low - propagation loss regime , approximately -7 db squeezing is predicted for a pump power of only 50 mw .
