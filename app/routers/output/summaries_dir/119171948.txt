we describe a holographic approach to explicitly compute the universal logarithmic contributions to entanglement and renyi entropies for free conformal scalar and spinor fields on even - dimensional spheres . this holographic derivation proceeds in two steps : first , following casini and huerta , a conformal map to thermal entropy in a hyperbolic geometry ; then , identification of the hyperbolic geometry with the conformal boundary of a bulk hyperbolic space and use of an ads / cft holographic formula to compute the resulting functional determinant . we explicitly verify the connection with the type - a trace anomaly for the entanglement entropy , whereas the renyi entropy is computed with aid of the sommerfeld formula in order to deal with a conical defect . as a by - product , we show that the log - coefficient of the renyi entropy for round spheres can be efficiently obtained as the q - analog of a procedure similar to the one found by cappelli and d'appollonio that rendered the type - a trace anomaly .
