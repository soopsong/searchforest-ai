if spacetime is built out of quantum bits , does the shape of space depend on how the bits are entangled ? the er = epr conjecture relates the entanglement entropy of a collection of black holes to the cross sectional area of einstein - rosen ( er ) bridges ( or wormholes ) connecting them . we show that the geometrical entropy of classical er bridges satisfies the subadditivity , triangle , strong subadditivity , and clw inequalities . these are nontrivial properties of entanglement entropy , so this is evidence for er = epr . we further show that the entanglement entropy associated to classical er bridges has nonpositive interaction information . this is not a property of entanglement entropy , in general . for example , the entangled four qubit pure state |ghz_4>=(|0000>+|1111>)/\sqrt{2 } has positive interaction information , so this state can not be described by a classical er bridge . large black holes with massive amounts of entanglement between them can fail to have a classical er bridge if they are built out of |ghz_4 > states . states with nonpositive interaction information are called monogamous . we conclude that classical er bridges require monogamous epr correlations .
