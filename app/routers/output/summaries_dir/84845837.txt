coherent quantum oscillators are basic physical systems both in quantum statistical physics and quantum thermodynamics . their realizations in lab often involve solid - state devices sensitive to changes in ambient temperature . we represent states of the solid - state optomechanical oscillator with temperature - dependent frequency by equivalent states of the mechanical oscillator with temperature - dependent energy levels . we interpret the temperature dependence as a consequence of strong coupling between the oscillator and the heat bath . we explore parameter regimes corresponding to anomalous behavior of mechanical and thermodynamic characteristics as a consequence of the strong coupling : ( i ) the localization and the purification induced by heating , and ( ii ) the negativity of two generalized heat capacities . the capacities can be used to witness non - linearity in the temperature dependency of the energy levels . our phenomenological experimentally - oriented approach can stimulate development of new optomechanical and thermomechanical experiments exploring basic concepts of strong coupling thermodynamics .
