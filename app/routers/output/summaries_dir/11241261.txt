we show that for any hilbert - space dimension , the optimal universal quantum cloner can be constructed from essentially the same quantum circuit , i.e. , we find a universal design for universal cloners . in the case of infinite dimensions ( which includes continuous variable quantum systems ) the universal cloner reduces to an essentially classical device . more generally , we construct a universal quantum circuit for distributing qudits in any dimension which acts covariantly under generalized displacements and momentum kicks . the behavior of this covariant distributor is controlled by its initial state . we show that suitable choices for this initial state yield both universal cloners and optimized cloners for limited alphabets of states whose states are related by generalized phase - space displacements .
