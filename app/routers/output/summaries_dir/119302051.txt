we present a systematic derivation of the dynamical polarizability and the ac stark shift of the ground and excited states of atoms interacting with a far - off - resonance light field of arbitrary polarization . we calculate the scalar , vector , and tensor polarizabilities of atomic cesium using resonance wavelengths and reduced matrix elements for a large number of transitions . we analyze the properties of the fictitious magnetic field produced by the vector polarizability in conjunction with the ellipticity of the polarization of the light field .
