we explore critical properties of two - dimensional lattices of spins interacting via an anisotropic heisenberg hamiltonian and subject to incoherent spin flips . we determine the steady - state solution of the master equation for the density matrix via the corner - space renormalization method . we investigate the finite - size scaling and critical exponent of the magnetic linear susceptibility associated to a dissipative ferromagnetic transition . we show that the von neumann entropy increases across the critical point , revealing a strongly mixed character of the ferromagnetic phase . entanglement is witnessed by the quantum fisher information which exhibits a critical behavior at the transition point , showing that quantum correlations play a crucial role in the transition even though the system is in a mixed state .
