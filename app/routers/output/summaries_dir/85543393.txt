we present a device independent quantum secret sharing scheme in arbitrary even dimension . we propose a $ d$-dimensional $ n$-partite linear game , utilizing a generic multipartite higher dimensional bell inequality , a generalization of mermin 's inequality in the higher dimension . probability to win this linear game defines the device independence test of the proposed scheme . the security is proved under causal independence of measurement devices and it is based on the polygamy property of entanglement . by defining $ \epsilon_{cor}$-correctness and $ \epsilon^c$-completeness for a quantum secret sharing scheme , we have also shown that the proposed scheme is $ \epsilon_{cor}$-correct and $ \epsilon^c$-complete .
