this work addresses the problem of vehicle path planning in the presence of obstacles and uncertainties , which is a fundamental problem in robotics . while many path planning algorithms have been proposed for decades , many of them have dealt with only deterministic environments or only open - loop uncertainty , i.e. , the uncertainty of the system state is not controlled and , typically , increases with time due to exogenous disturbances , which leads to the design of potentially conservative nominal paths . in order to deal with disturbances and reduce uncertainty , generally , a lower - level feedback controller is used . we conjecture that , if a path planner can consider the closed - loop evolution of the system uncertainty , it can compute less conservative but still feasible paths . to this end , in this work we develop a new approach that is based on optimal covariance steering , which explicitly steers the state covariance for stochastic linear systems with additive noise under non - convex state chance constraints . the proposed framework is verified using simple numerical simulations .
