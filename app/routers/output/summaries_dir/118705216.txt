the limit theorems of discrete- and continuous - time quantum walks on the line have been intensively studied . we show a relation among limit distributions of quantum walks , heun differential equations and gauss differential equations . indeed , we derive the second - order fucksian differential equations which limit density functions of quantum walks satisfy . moreover , using both differential equations , we discuss a relationship between discrete- and continuous - time quantum walks . taking suitable limit , we can transform a heun equation obtained from the limit density function of the discrete - time quantum walk to a gauss equation given by that of the continuous - time quantum walk .
