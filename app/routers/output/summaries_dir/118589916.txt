many discussion about the black hole conundrums , such as singularity and information loss , suggested that there must be some essential irreconcilable conflict between quantum theory and classical gravity theory , which can not be solved with any semiclassical quantized model of gravity , the only feasible way must be some complete unified quantum theory of gravity . in \cite{vachaspati2007a } , the arguments indicate the possibility of an alternate outcome of gravitational collapse which avoids the information loss problem . in this paper , also with semiclassical analysis , it shows that so long as the mechanism of black hole evaporation satisfies a quite loose condition that the evaporation lifespan is finite for external observers , regardless of the detailed mechanism and process of evaporation , the conundrums above can be naturally avoided . this condition can be satisfied with hawking - unruh mechanism . thus , the conflict between quantum theory and classical gravity theory may be not as serious as it seemed to be , the effectiveness of semiclassical methods might be underestimated . an exact universal solution with spherical symmetry of einstein field equation has been derived in this paper . all possible solutions with spherical symmetry of einstein field equation are its special cases . in addition , some problems of the penrose diagram of an evaporating black hole first introduced by hawking in 1975 \cite{hawking1975 } are clarified .
