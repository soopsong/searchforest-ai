cavity - based large - scale quantum information processing ( qip ) needs a large number of qubits and placing all of them in a single cavity quickly runs into many fundamental and practical problems such as the increase of cavity decay rate and decrease of qubit - cavity coupling strength . therefore , future qip most likely will require quantum networks consisting of a large number of cavities , each hosting and coupled to multiple qubits . in this work , we propose a way to prepare a $ w$-class entangled state of spatially - separated multiple qubits in different cavities , which are connected to a coupler qubit . because no cavity photon is excited , decoherence caused by the cavity decay is greatly suppressed during the entanglement preparation . this proposal needs only one coupler qubit and one operational step , and does not require using a classical pulse , so that the engineering complexity is much reduced and the operation is greatly simplified . as an example of the experimental implementation , we further give a numerical analysis , which shows that high - fidelity generation of the $ w$ state using three superconducting phase qubits each embedded in a one - dimensional transmission line resonator is feasible within the present circuit qed technique . the proposal is quite general and can be applied to accomplish the same task with other types of qubits such as superconducting flux qubits , charge qubits , quantum dots , nitrogen - vacancy centers and atoms .
