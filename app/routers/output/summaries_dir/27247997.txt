we study ` ` frustrated ' ' hopping models , in which at least one energy band , at the maximum or minimum of the spectrum , is dispersionless . the states of the flat band(s ) can be represented in a basis which is fully localized , having support on a vanishing fraction of the system in the thermodynamic limit . in the majority of examples , a dispersive band touches the flat band(s ) at a number of discrete points in momentum space . we demonstrate that this band touching is related to states which exhibit non - trivial topology in real space . specifically , these states have support on one - dimensional loops which wind around the entire system ( with periodic boundary conditions ) . a counting argument is given that determines , in each case , whether there is band touching or not , in precise correspondence to the result of straightforward diagonalization . when they are present , the topological structure protects the band touchings in the sense that they can only be removed by perturbations which { \sl also } split the degeneracy of the flat band .
