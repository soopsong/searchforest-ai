a new method for computing sums on a quantum computer is introduced . this technique uses the quantum fourier transform and reduces the number of qubits necessary for addition by removing the need for temporary carry bits . this approach also allows the addition of a classical number to a quantum superposition without encoding the classical number in the quantum register . this method also allows for massive parallelization in its execution .
