we present a full operator approach to treatment of the cross - kerr interaction combined with parametric amplification . it is shown that this problem can be exactly integrated using the method of higher - order operators . while the initial basis is infinite - dimensional , an orthogonal transformation can reduce the problem exactly into a six - dimensional basis which can be integrated conveniently .
