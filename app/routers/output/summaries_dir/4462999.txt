interacting fermions on a lattice can develop strong quantum correlations , which lie at the heart of the classical intractability of many exotic phases of matter . seminal efforts are underway in the control of artificial quantum systems , that can be made to emulate the underlying fermi - hubbard models . electrostatically confined conduction band electrons define interacting quantum coherent spin and charge degrees of freedom that allow all - electrical pure - state initialisation and readily adhere to an engineerable fermi - hubbard hamiltonian . until now , however , the substantial electrostatic disorder inherent to solid state has made attempts at emulating fermi - hubbard physics on solid - state platforms few and far between . here , we show that for gate - defined quantum dots , this disorder can be suppressed in a controlled manner . novel insights and a newly developed semi - automated and scalable toolbox allow us to homogeneously and independently dial in the electron filling and nearest - neighbour tunnel coupling . bringing these ideas and tools to fruition , we realize the first detailed characterization of the collective coulomb blockade transition , which is the finite - size analogue of the interaction - driven mott metal - to - insulator transition . as automation and device fabrication of semiconductor quantum dots continue to improve , the ideas presented here show how quantum dots can be used to investigate the physics of ever more complex many - body states .
