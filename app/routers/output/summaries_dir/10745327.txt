we prove new results on perfect state transfer of quantum walks on quotient graphs . since a graph $ g$ has perfect state transfer if and only if its quotient $ g/\pi$ , under any equitable partition $ \pi$ , has perfect state transfer , we exhibit graphs with perfect state transfer between two vertices but which lack automorphism swapping them . this answers a question of godsil ( discrete mathematics 312(1):129 - 147 , 2011 ) . we also show that the cartesian product of quotient graphs $ \box_{k } g_{k}/\pi_{k}$ is isomorphic to the quotient graph $ \box_{k } g_{k}/\pi$ , for some equitable partition $ \pi$. this provides an algebraic description of a construction due to feder ( physical review letters 97 , 180502 , 2006 ) which is based on many - boson quantum walk .
