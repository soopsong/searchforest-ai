quantum networks will support long - distance quantum key distribution ( qkd ) and distributed quantum computation , and are an active area of both experimental and theoretical research . here , we present an analysis of topologically complex networks of quantum repeaters composed of heterogeneous links . quantum networks have fundamental behavioral differences from classical networks ; the delicacy of quantum states makes a practical path selection algorithm imperative , but classical notions of resource utilization are not directly applicable , rendering known path selection mechanisms inadequate . to adapt dijkstra 's algorithm for quantum repeater networks that generate entangled bell pairs , we quantify the key differences and define a link cost metric , seconds per bell pair of a particular fidelity , where a single bell pair is the resource consumed to perform one quantum teleportation . simulations that include both the physical interactions and the extensive classical messaging confirm that dijkstra 's algorithm works well in a quantum context . simulating about three hundred heterogeneous paths , comparing our path cost and the total work along the path gives a coefficient of determination of 0.88 or better .
