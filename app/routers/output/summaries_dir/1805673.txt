this paper is concerned with the coherent quantum filtering ( cqf ) problem , where a quantum observer is cascaded in a measurement - free fashion with a linear quantum plant so as to minimize a mean square error of estimating the plant variables of interest . both systems are governed by markovian hudson - parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations driven by bosonic fields in vacuum state . these quantum dynamics are specified by the hamiltonians and system - field coupling operators . we apply a recently proposed transverse hamiltonian variational method to the development of first - order necessary conditions of optimality for the cqf problem in a larger class of observers . the latter is obtained by perturbing the hamiltonian and system - field coupling operators of a linear coherent quantum observer along linear combinations of unitary weyl operators , whose role here resembles that of the needle variations in the pontryagin minimum principle . we show that if the observer is a stationary point of the performance functional in the class of linear observers , then it is also a stationary point with respect to the weyl variations in the larger class of nonlinear observers .
