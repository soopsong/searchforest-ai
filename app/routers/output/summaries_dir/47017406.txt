a notion of quantum conference is introduced in analogy with the usual notion of a conference that happens frequently in today 's world . quantum conference is defined as a multiparty secure communication task that allows each party to communicate their messages simultaneously to all other parties in a secure manner using quantum resources . two efficient and secure protocols for quantum conference have been proposed . the security and efficiency of the proposed protocols have been analyzed critically . it is shown that the proposed protocols can be realized using a large number of entangled states and group of operators . further , it is shown that the proposed schemes can be easily reduced to protocol for multiparty quantum key distribution and some earlier proposed schemes of quantum conference , where the notion of quantum conference was different .
