we review several proposed spintronic devices that can provide new functionality or improve available functions of electronic devices . in particular , we discuss a high mobility field effect spin transistor , an all - metal spin transistor , and our recent proposal of an all - semiconductor spin transistor and a spin battery . we also address some key issues in spin - polarized transport , which are relevant to the feasibility and operation of hybrid semiconductor devices . finally , we discuss a more radical aspect of spintronic research -- the spin - based quantum computation and quantum information processing .
