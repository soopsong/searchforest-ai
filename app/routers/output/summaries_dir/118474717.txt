it is well known that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local realistic theories . svetlichny showed , through the development of a bell - like inequality , that quantum mechanics is also incompatible with a restricted class of nonlocal realistic theories for three particles where any two - body nonlocal correlations are allowed [ phys . rev . d 35 , 3066 ( 1987 ) ] . in the present work , we experimentally generate three - photon ghz states to test svetlichny 's inequality . our states are fully characterized by quantum state tomography using an overcomplete set of measurements and have a fidelity of ( 84+/-1)% with the target state . we measure a convincing , 3.6 std . , violation of svetlichny 's inequality and rule out this class of restricted nonlocal realistic models .
