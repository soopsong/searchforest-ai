it has previously been shown that probabilistic quantum logic operations can be performed using linear optical elements , additional photons ( ancilla ) , and post - selection based on the output of single - photon detectors . here we describe the operation of several quantum logic operations of an elementary nature , including a quantum parity check and a quantum encoder , and we show how they can be combined to implement a controlled - not ( cnot ) gate . all of these gates can be constructed using polarizing beam splitters that completely transmit one state of polarization and totally reflect the orthogonal state of polarization , which allows a simple explanation of each operation . we also describe a polarizing beam splitter implementation of a cnot gate that is closely analogous to the quantum teleportation technique previously suggested by gottesman and chuang [ nature 402 , p.390 ( 1999 ) ] . finally , our approach has the interesting feature that it makes practical use of a quantum - eraser technique .
