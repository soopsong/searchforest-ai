we consider the quantum centipede made of $ n$ fermionic quantum walkers on the one - dimensional lattice interacting by means of the simplest of all hard - bound constraints : the distance between two consecutive fermions is either one or two lattice spacings . this composite quantum walker spreads ballistically , just as the simple quantum walk . however , because of the interactions between the internal degrees of freedom , the distribution of its center - of - mass velocity displays numerous ballistic fronts in the long - time limit , corresponding to singularities in the empirical velocity distribution . the spectrum of the centipede and the corresponding group velocities are analyzed by direct means for the first few values of $ n$. some analytical results are obtained for arbitrary $ n$ by exploiting an exact mapping of the problem onto a free - fermion system . we thus derive the maximal velocity describing the ballistic spreading of the two extremal fronts of the centipede wavefunction , including its non - trivial value in the large-$n$ limit .
