squeezed spin states have important applications in quantum metrology and sensing . it has been shown by s{\o}rensen and m{\o}lmer [ phys . rev . a 66 , 022314(2002 ) ] that an effective one - axis - twisting interaction can be realized in a cavity setup via a double off - resonance stimulated raman scattering , resulting in a noise reduction scaling $ \propto 1 / n^{2/3}$ with $ n$ being the atom number . here , we show that , by making an appropriate change of the initial input spin state , it is possible to produce a one - axis - twisting spin squeezing via a \emph{single } off - resonance stimulated raman scattering , which thus can greatly simplify the realistic implementation . we also show that the one - axis - twisting interaction can be transformed into a more efficient two - axis - twisting interaction by rotating the collective spin while coupling to the cavity , yielding a heisenberg limited noise reduction $ \propto1 / n$. considering the noise effects due to atomic decoherence and cavity decay , we find that substantial squeezing is still attainable with current laboratory techniques .
