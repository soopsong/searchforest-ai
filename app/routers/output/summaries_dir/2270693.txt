the pauli groups are ubiquitous in quantum information theory because of their usefulness in describing quantum states and operations and their readily understood symmetry properties . in addition , the most well - understood quantum error correcting codes -- stabilizer codes -- are built using pauli operators . the eigenstates of these operators -- stabilizer states -- display a structure ( e.g. , mutual orthogonality relationships ) that has made them useful in examples of multi - qubit non - locality and contextuality . here , we apply the graph - theoretical contextuality formalism of cabello , severini and winter to sets of stabilizer states , with particular attention to the effect of generalizing two - level qubit systems to odd prime d - level qudit systems . while state - independent contextuality using two - qubit states does not generalize to qudits , we show explicitly how state - dependent contextuality associated with a bell inequality does generalize . along the way we note various structural properties of stabilizer states , with respect to their orthogonality relationships , which may be of independent interest .
