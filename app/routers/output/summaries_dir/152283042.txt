the working substance fueling a quantum heat engine may contain coherence in its energy basis , depending on the dynamics of the engine cycle . in some models of quantum otto heat engines , energy coherence has been associated with entropy production and quantum friction . we considered a quantum otto heat engine operating at finite time . coherence is generated and the working substance does not reach thermal equilibrium after interacting with the hot heat reservoir , leaving the working substance in a state with residual energy coherence . we observe an interference - like effect between the residual coherence ( after the incomplete thermalization ) and the coherence generated in the subsequent finite - time stroke . we introduce analytical expressions highlighting the role of coherence and examine how this dynamical interference effect influences the engine performance . additionally , in this scenario in which coherence is present along the cycle , we argue that the careful tuning of the cycle parameters may exploit this interference effect and make coherence acts like a dynamical quantum lubricant . to illustrate this , we numerically consider an experimentally feasible example and compare the engine performance to the performance of a similar engine where the residual coherence is completely erased , ruling out the dynamical interference effect .
