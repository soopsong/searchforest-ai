a practical scheme for the demonstration of perfect one - sided device - independent quantum secret sharing is proposed . the scheme involves a three - mode optomechanical system in which a pair of independent cavity modes is driven by short laser pulses and interact with a movable mirror . we demonstrate that by tuning the laser frequency to the blue ( anti - stokes ) sideband of the average frequency of the cavity modes , the modes become mutually coherent and then may collectively steer the mirror mode to a perfect einstein - podolsky - rosen state . the scheme is shown to be experimentally feasible , it is robust against the frequency difference between the modes , mechanical thermal noise and damping , and coupling strengths of the cavity modes to the mirror .
