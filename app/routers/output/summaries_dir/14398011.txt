modern classical computing devices , except of simplest calculators , have von neumann architecture , i.e. , a part of the memory is used for the program and a part for the data . it is likely , that analogues of such architecture are also desirable for the future applications in quantum computing , communications and control . it is also interesting for the modern theoretical research in the quantum information science and raises challenging questions about an experimental assessment of such a programmable models . together with some progress in the given direction , such ideas encounter specific problems arising from the very essence of quantum laws . currently are known two different ways to overcome such problems , sometime denoted as a stochastic and deterministic approach . the presented paper is devoted to the second one , that is also may be called the programmable quantum networks with pure states . in the paper are discussed basic principles and theoretical models that can be used for the design of such nano - devices , e.g. , the conditional quantum dynamics , the nielsen - chuang"no - programming theorem , the idea of deterministic and stochastic quantum gates arrays . both programmable quantum networks with finite registers and hybrid models with continuous quantum variables are considered . as a basic model for the universal programmable quantum network with pure states and finite program register is chosen a"control - shift"quantum processor architecture with three buses introduced in earlier works . it is shown also , that quantum cellular automata approach to the construction of an universal programmable quantum computer often may be considered as the particular case of such design .
