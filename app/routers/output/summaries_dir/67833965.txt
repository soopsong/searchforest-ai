we propose the gaussian continuous - variable quantum key distribution using squeezed states in the composite channels including atmospheric propagation with transmittance fluctuations . we show that adjustments of signal modulation and use of optimal feasible squeezing can be sufficient to significantly overcome the coherent - state protocol and drastically improve the performance of quantum key distribution in atmospheric channels , also in the presence of additional attenuating and noisy channels . furthermore , we consider examples of atmospheric links of different lengths , and show that optimization of both squeezing and modulation is crucial for reduction of protocol downtime and increase of secure atmospheric channel distance . our results demonstrate unexpected advantage of fragile squeezed states of light in the free - space quantum key distribution applicable in daylight and stable against atmospheric turbulence .
