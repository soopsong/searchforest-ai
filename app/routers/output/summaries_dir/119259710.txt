we study point - like polarizable particles confined in a 1d very elongated trap within the evanescent field of an optical nano - fiber or nano - structure . when illuminated transversely by coherent light , collective light scattering into propagating fiber modes induces long range interactions and eventually crystallisation of the particles into regular order . we develop a simple and intuitive scattering - matrix based approach to study these long - range interactions by collective scattering and the resulting light - induced self - ordering . for few particles we derive explicit conditions for self - consistent stable ordering . in the purely dispersive limit with negligible back - scattering , we recover the prediction of an equidistant lattice as previously found for effective dipole - dipole interaction models . we generalize our model to experimentally more realistic configurations including backscattering , absorption and a directional scattering asymmetry . for larger particle ensembles the resulting self - consistent particle - field equations can be numerically solved to study the formation of long - range order and stability limits .
