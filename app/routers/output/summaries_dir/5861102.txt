we perform formal verification of quantum circuits by integrating several techniques specialized to particular classes of circuits . our verification methodology is based on the new notion of a reversible miter that allows one to leverage existing techniques for circuit simplification of quantum circuits . for reversible circuits which arise as runtime bottlenecks of key quantum algorithms , we develop several verification techniques and empirically compare them . we also combine existing quantum verification tools with the use of sat - solvers . experiments with circuits for shor 's number - factoring algorithm , containing thousands of gates , show improvements in efficiency by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude .
