the parity gate emerged recently as a promising resource for performing universal quantum computation with fermions using only linear interactions . here we analyse the parity gate ( p - gate ) from a theoretical point of view in the context of quantum networks . we present several schemes for entanglement generation with p - gates and show that native networks simplify considerably the resources required for producing multi - qubit entanglement , like n - ghz states . other applications include a bell - state analyser and teleportation . we also show that cluster state fusion can be performed deterministically with parity measurements . we then extend this analysis to hybrid quantum networks containing spin and mode qubits . starting from an easy - to - prepare resource ( spin - mode entanglement of single electrons ) we show how to produce a spin n - ghz state with linear elements ( beam - splitters and local spin - flips ) and charge - parity detectors ; this state can be used as a resource in a spin quantum computer or as a precursor for constructing cluster states . finally , we construct a novel spin cz - gate by using the mode degrees of freedom as ancillae .
