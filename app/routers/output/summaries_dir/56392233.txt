we derive two quantum uncertainty relations for position and momentum coarse - grained measurements . building on previous results , we first improve the lower bound for uncertainty relations using the renyi entropy , particularly in the case of coarse - grained measurements . we then sharpen a heisenberg - like uncertainty relation derived previously in [ europhys . lett . 97 , 38003 , ( 2012 ) ] that uses variances and reduces to the usual one in the case of infinite precision measurements . our sharpened uncertainty relation is meaningful for any amount of coarse graining . that is , there is always a non - trivial uncertainty relation for coarse - grained measurement of the non - commuting observables , even in the limit of extremely large coarse graining .
