excitonic transitions offer a possible route to ultrafast optical spin manipulation in coupled nanostructures . we perform here a detailed study of the three principal exciton - mediated decoherence channels for optically - controlled electron spin qubits in coupled quantum dots : radiative decay of the excitonic state , exciton - phonon interactions , and landau - zener transitions between laser - dressed states . we consider a scheme to produce an entangling controlled - phase gate on a pair of coupled spins which , in its simplest dynamic form , renders the system subject to fast decoherence rates associated with exciton creation during the gating operation . in contrast , we show that an adiabatic approach employing off - resonant laser excitation allows us to suppress all sources of decoherence simultaneously , significantly increasing the fidelity of operations at only a relatively small gating time cost . we find that controlled - phase gates accurate to one part in 10 ^ 2 can realistically be achieved with the adiabatic approach , whereas the conventional dynamic approach does not appear to support a fidelity suitable for scalable quantum computation . our predictions could be demonstrated experimentally in the near future .
