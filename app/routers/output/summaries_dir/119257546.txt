we consider fault - tolerant quantum computation in the context where there are no fresh ancilla qubits available during the computation , and where the noise is due to a general quantum channel . we show that there are three classes of noisy channels : in the first , typified by the depolarizing channel , computation is only possible for a logarithmic time . in the second class , of which the dephasing channel is an example , computation is possible for polynomial time . the amplitude damping channel is an example of the third class , and for this class of channels , it is possible to compute for an exponential time in the number of qubits available .
