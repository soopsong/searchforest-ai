we propose and analyze a hybrid device by integrating a microscale diamond beam with a single built - in nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center spin to a superconducting coplanar waveguide ( cpw ) cavity . we find that under an ac electric field the quantized motion of the diamond beam can strongly couple to the single cavity photons via dielectric interaction . together with the strong spin - motion interaction via a large magnetic field gradient , it provides a hybrid quantum device where the dia- mond resonator can strongly couple both to the single microwave cavity photons and to the single nv center spin . this enables coherent information transfer and effective coupling between the nv spin and the cpw cavity via mechanically dark polaritons . this hybrid spin - electromechanical de- vice , with tunable couplings by external fields , offers a realistic platform for implementing quantum information with single nv spins , diamond mechanical resonators , and single microwave photons .
