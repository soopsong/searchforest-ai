quantum walks , both discrete ( coined ) and continuous time , form the basis of several quantum algorithms and have been used to model processes such as transport in spin chains and quantum chemistry . the enhanced spreading and mixing properties of quantum walks compared with their classical counterparts have been well - studied on regular structures and also shown to be sensitive to defects and imperfections in the lattice . as a simple example of a disordered system , we consider percolation lattices , in which edges or sites are randomly missing , interrupting the progress of the quantum walk . we use numerical simulation to study the properties of coined quantum walks on these percolation lattices in one and two dimensions . in one dimension ( the line ) we introduce a simple notion of quantum tunneling and determine how this affects the properties of the quantum walk as it spreads . on two - dimensional percolation lattices , we show how the spreading rate varies from linear in the number of steps down to zero , as the percolation probability decreases to the critical point . this provides an example of fractional scaling in quantum walk dynamics .
