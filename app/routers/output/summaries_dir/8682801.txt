evaluating the quantum capacity of quantum channels is an important but difficult problem , even for channels of low input and output dimension . smith and smolin showed that the quantum capacity of the clifford - twirl of a qubit amplitude damping channel ( a qubit depolarizing channel ) has a quantum capacity that is at most the coherent information of the qubit amplitude damping channel evaluated on the maximally mixed input state . we restrict our attention to obtaining upper bounds on the quantum capacity using a generalization of smith and smolin 's degradable extension technique . given a degradable channel $ \mathcal n$ and a finite projective group of unitaries $ \mathcal v$ , we show that the $ \mathcal v$-twirl of $ \mathcal n$ has a quantum capacity at most the coherent information of $ \mathcal n$ maximized over a $ \mathcal v$-contracted space of input states . as a consequence , degradable channels that are covariant with respect to diagonal pauli matrices have quantum capacities that are their coherent information maximized over just the diagonal input states . as an application of our main result , we supply new upper bounds on the quantum capacity of some unital and non - unital channels -- $ d$-dimensional depolarizing channels , two - qubit locally symmetric pauli channels , and shifted qubit depolarizing channels .
