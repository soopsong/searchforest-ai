quantum information degrades over distance due to the unavoidable imperfections of the transmission channels , with loss as the leading factor . this simple fact hinders quantum communication , as it relies on propagating quantum systems . a solution to this issue is to introduce quantum repeaters at regular intervals along a lossy channel , to revive the quantum signal . in this work we study unitary one - way quantum repeaters , which do not need to perform measurements and do not require quantum memories , and are therefore considerably simpler than other schemes . we introduce and analyze two methods to construct hamiltonians that generate a repeater interaction that can beat the fundamental repeaterless key rate bound even in the presence of an additional coupling loss , with signals that contain only a handful of photons . the natural evolution of this work will be to approximate a repeater interaction by combining simple optical elements .
