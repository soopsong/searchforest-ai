we consider a controlled quantum system whose finite dimensional state is governed by a discrete - time nonlinear markov process . in open - loop , the measurements are assumed to be quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) . the eigenstates of the measured observable are thus the open - loop stationary states : they are used to construct a closed - loop supermartingale playing the role of a strict control lyapunov function . the parameters of this supermartingale are calculated by inverting a metzler matrix that characterizes the impact of the control input on the kraus operators defining the markov process . the resulting state feedback scheme , taking into account a known constant delay , provides the almost sure convergence of the controlled system to the target state . this convergence is ensured even in the case where the filter equation results from imperfect measurements corrupted by random errors with conditional probabilities given as a left stochastic matrix . closed - loop simulations corroborated by experimental data illustrate the interest of such nonlinear feedback scheme for the photon box , a cavity quantum electrodynamics system .
