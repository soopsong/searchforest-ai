we report a fully guided - wave source of polarisation entangled photons based on a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide mounted in a sagnac interferometer . we demonstrate the source 's quality by converting polarisation entanglement to postselection - free energy - time entanglement for which we obtain a near - optimal $ s$-parameter of $ 2.75 \pm 0.02 $ , i.e. a violation of the bell inequality by more than 35 standard deviations . the exclusive use of guided - wave components makes our source compact and stable which is a prerequisite for increasingly complex quantum applications . additionally , our source offers a great versatility in terms of photon pair emission spectrum and generated quantum state , making it suitable for a broad range of quantum applications such as cryptography and metrology . in this sense , we show how to use our source for chromatic dispersion measurements in optical fibres which opens new avenues in the field of quantum metrology .
