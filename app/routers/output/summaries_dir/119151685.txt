we give a simple and physically intuitive necessary and sufficient condition for a map acting on a compact metric space to be mixing ( i.e. infinitely many applications of the map transfer any input into a fixed convergency point ) . this is a generalization of the"lyapunov direct method " . first we prove this theorem in topological spaces and for arbitrary continuous maps . finally we apply our theorem to maps which are relevant in open quantum systems and quantum information , namely quantum channels . in this context we also discuss the relations between mixing and ergodicity ( i.e. the property that there exist only a single input state which is left invariant by a single application of the map ) showing that the two are equivalent when the invariant point of the ergodic map is pure .
