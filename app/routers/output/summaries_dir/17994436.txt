this paper considers open quantum systems whose dynamic variables satisfy canonical commutation relations and are governed by markovian hudson - parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations driven by external bosonic fields . the dependence of the hamiltonian and the system - field coupling operators on the system variables is represented using the weyl functional calculus . this leads to an integro - differential equation ( ide ) for the evolution of the quasi - characteristic function ( qcf ) which encodes the dynamics of mixed moments of the system variables . unlike quantum master equations for reduced density operators , this ide involves only complex - valued functions on finite - dimensional euclidean spaces and extends the wigner - moyal phase - space approach for quantum stochastic systems . the dynamics of the qcf and the related wigner quasi - probability density function ( qpdf ) are discussed in more detail for the case when the coupling operators depend linearly on the system variables and the hamiltonian has a nonquadratic part represented in the weyl quantization form . for this class of quantum stochastic systems , we also consider an approximate computation of invariant states and discuss the deviation from gaussian quantum states in terms of the $ \chi^2$-divergence ( or the second - order renyi relative entropy ) applied to the qpdf . the results of the paper may find applications to investigating different aspects of the moment stability , relaxation dynamics and invariant states in open quantum systems .
