we consider the class of quantum stochastic evolutions ( $ slh$-models ) leading to a quantum dynamical semigroup over a fixed quantum mechanical system ( taken to be finite - dimensional ) . we show that if the semigroup is dissipative , that is , the coupling operators are non - zero , then a dynamical decoupling scheme based on unitary rotations on the system space can not suppress decoherence even in the limit where the period between pulses vanishes . we emphasize the role of the fock space dilation used here to construct a quantum stochastic model , as there are often dilations of the same semigroup using an environmental noise model of lower level of chaoticity for which dynamical decoupling is effective . we show that the chebotarev - gregoratti hamiltonian behind a quantum stochastic evolution is an example of a hamiltonian dynamics on a joint system - environment that can not be dynamically decoupled in this way .
