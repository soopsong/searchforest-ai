phonons strongly influence the optical control of semiconductor quantum dots . when modeling the electron - phonon interaction in several theoretical approaches the quantum dot geometry is approximated by a spherical structure , though typical self - assembled quantum dots are strongly lens - shaped . by explicitly comparing simulations of a spherical and a lens - shaped dot using a well - established correlation expansion approach we show that indeed lens - shaped dots can be exactly mapped to a spherical geometry when studying the phonon influence on the electronic system . we also give a recipe to reproduce spectral densities from more involved dots by rather simple spherical models . on the other hand , breaking the spherical symmetry has a pronounced impact on the spatio - temporal properties of the phonon dynamics . as an example we show that for a lens - shaped quantum dot the phonon emission is strongly concentrated along the direction of the smallest axis of the dot which is important for the use of phonons for the communication between different dots .
