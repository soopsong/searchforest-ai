quantum circuits are time dependent diagrams describing the process of quantum computation . usually , a quantum algorithm must be mapped into a quantum circuit . optimal synthesis of quantum circuits is intractable and heuristic methods must be employed . with the use of heuristics , the optimality of circuits is no longer guaranteed . in this paper , we consider a local optimization technique based on templates to simplify and reduce the depth of non - optimal quantum circuits . we present and analyze templates in the general case , and provide particular details for the circuits composed of not , cnot and controlled - sqrt - of - not gates . we apply templates to optimize various common circuits implementing multiple control toffoli gates and quantum boolean arithmetic circuits . we also show how templates can be used to compact the number of levels of a quantum circuit . the runtime of our implementation is small while the reduction in number of quantum gates and number of levels is significant .
