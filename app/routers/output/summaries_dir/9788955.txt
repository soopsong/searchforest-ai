we consider a discrete model that describes a linear chain of particles coupled to a single - site defect with instantaneous kerr nonlinearity . we show that this model can be regarded as a nonlinear generalization of the familiar fano - anderson model , and it can generate the amplitude depended bistable resonant transmission or reflection . we identify these effects as the nonlinear fano resonance , and study its properties for continuous waves and pulses .
