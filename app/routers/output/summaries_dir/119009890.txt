we study the dynamics of entanglement between two spins which is created by the coupling to a common thermal reservoir . the reservoir is a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ising transverse field chain thermally excited , the two defect spins couple to two spins of the chain which can be at a macroscopic distance . in the weak - coupling and low - temperature limit the spin chain is mapped onto a bath of linearly interacting oscillators using the holstein - primakoff transformation . we analyse the time evolution of the density matrix of the two defect spins for transient times and deduce the entanglement which is generated by the common reservoir . we discuss several scenarios for different initial states of the two spins and for varying distances .
