we study quantum algorithms for spatial search on finite dimensional grids . patel et al . and falk have proposed algorithms based on a quantum walk without a coin , with different operators applied at even and odd steps . until now , such algorithms have been studied only using numerical simulations . in this paper , we present the first rigorous analysis for an algorithm of this type , showing that the optimal number of steps is $ o(\sqrt{n\log n})$ and the success probability is $ o(1/\log n)$ , where $ n$ is the number of vertices . this matches the performance achieved by algorithms that use other forms of quantum walks .
