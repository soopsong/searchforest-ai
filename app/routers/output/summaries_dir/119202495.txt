we demonstrate a silicon - chip biphoton source with an unprecedented quantum cross correlation up to $ { \rm g_{si}^{(2)}(0 ) = ( 2.58 \pm 0.16 ) \times 10 ^ 4}$. the emitted biphotons are intrinsically single - mode , with self correlations of $ { \rm g_{ss}^{(2)}(0 ) = 1.90 \pm 0.05}$ and $ { \rm g_{ii}^{(2)}(0 ) = 1.87 \pm 0.06}$ for signal and idler photons , respectively . we observe the waveform asymmetry of cross correlation between signal and idler photons and reveal the identical and non - exponential nature of self correlations of individual signal and idler photon modes , which is a nature of cavity - enhanced nonlinear optical processes . the high efficiency and high purity of the biphoton source allow us to herald single photons with a conditional self correlation $ \rm g_{c}^{(2)}(0)$ as low as $ \rm 0.0059 \pm 0.0014 $ at a pair flux of $ \rm 1.95 \times 10 ^ 5 $ pairs / s , which remains below $ \rm 0.026 \pm 0.001 $ for a biphoton flux up to $ \rm 2.93 \times 10 ^ 6 $ pairs / s , with a photon preparation efficiency in the single - mode fiber up to 51 % , among the best values that have ever been reported . our work unambiguously demonstrates that silicon photonic chips are superior material and device platforms for integrated quantum photonics .
