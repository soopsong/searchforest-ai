we discuss the use of incoherent light as a resource to control the atomic dynamics and review the proposed in phys . rev . a 84 , 042106 ( 2011 ) method for a controlled transfer between any pure and mixed states of quantum systems using a combination of incoherent and coherent light . formally , the method provides a constructive proof for an approximate open - loop markovian state - transfer controllability of quantum system in the space of all density matrices --- the strongest possible degree of quantum state control .
