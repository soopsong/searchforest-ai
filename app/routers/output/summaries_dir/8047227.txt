this paper presents several results on performance analysis for a class of uncertain linear quantum systems subject to either quadratic or non - quadratic perturbations in the system hamiltonian . also , coherent guaranteed cost controllers are designed for the uncertain quantum systems to achieve improved control performance . the coherent controller is realized by adding a control hamiltonian to the quantum system and its performance is demonstrated by an example .
