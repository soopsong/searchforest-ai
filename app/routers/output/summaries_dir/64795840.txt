elitzur and vaidman have proposed a measurement scheme that , based on the quantum superposition principle , allows one to detect the presence of an object --- in a dramatic scenario , a bomb --- without interacting with it . it was pointed out by ghirardi that this interaction - free measurement scheme can be put in direct relation with falsification tests of the macro - realistic worldview . here we have implemented the"bomb test"with a single atom trapped in a spin - dependent optical lattice to show explicitly a violation of the leggett - garg inequality --- a quantitative criterion fulfilled by macro - realistic physical theories . to perform interaction - free measurements , we have implemented a novel measurement method that correlates spin and position of the atom . this method , which quantum mechanically entangles spin and position , finds general application for spin measurements , thereby avoiding the shortcomings inherent in the widely used push - out technique . allowing decoherence to dominate the evolution of our system causes a transition from quantum to classical behavior in fulfillment of the leggett - garg inequality .
