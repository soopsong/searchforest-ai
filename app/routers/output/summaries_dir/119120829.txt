in this paper we argue that a firewall is simply a manifestation of an inconsistent truncation of non - perturbative effects that unitarize the semiclassical black hole . namely , we show that a naive truncation of quantum corrections to the hawking spectrum at order $ { \cal o}(e^{-s})$ , inexorably leads to a"localised ' ' divergent energy density near the black hole horizon . nevertheless , in the same approximation , a distant observer only sees a discretised spectrum and concludes that unitarity is achieved by $ { \cal o}(e^{-s})$ effects . this is due to the fact that instead , the correct quantum corrections to the hawking spectrum go like $ { \cal o } ( g^{tt } e^{-s})$. therefore , while at a distance far away from the horizon , where $ g^{tt}\approx 1 $ , quantum corrections { \it are } perturbative , they { \it do } diverge close to the horizon , where $ g^{tt}\rightarrow \infty$. nevertheless , these"corrections"nicely re - sum so that correlations functions are smooth at the would - be black hole horizon . thus , we conclude that the appearance of firewalls is just a signal of the breaking of the semiclassical approximation at the page time , even for large black holes .
