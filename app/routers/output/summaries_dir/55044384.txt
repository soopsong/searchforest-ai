the electron - phonon coupling in self - assembled ingaas quantum dots is relatively weak at low light intensities , which means that the zero - phonon line in emission is strong compared to the phonon sideband . however , the coupling to acoustic phonons can be dynamically enhanced in the presence of an intense optical pulse tuned within the phonon sideband . recent experiments have shown that this dynamic vibronic coupling can enable population inversion to be achieved when pumping with a blue - shifted laser and for rapid de - excitation of an inverted state with red detuning . in this paper we confirm the incoherent nature of the phonon - assisted pumping process and explore the temperature dependence of the mechanism . we also show that a combination of blue- and red - shifted pulses can create and destroy an exciton within a timescale ~20 ps determined by the pulse duration and ultimately limited by the phonon thermalisation time .
