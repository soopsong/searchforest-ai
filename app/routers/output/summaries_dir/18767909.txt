we study the stability of quantum pure states and , more generally , subspaces for stochastic dynamics that describe continuously -- monitored systems . we show that the target subspace is almost surely invariant if and only if it is invariant for the average evolution , and that the same equivalence holds for the global asymptotic stability . moreover , we prove that a strict linear lyapunov function for the average evolution always exists , and latter can be used to derive sharp bounds on the lyapunov exponents of the associated semigroup . nonetheless , we also show that taking into account the measurements can lead to an improved bound on stability rate for the stochastic , non - averaged dynamics . we discuss explicit examples where the almost sure stability rate can be made arbitrary large while the average one stays constant .
