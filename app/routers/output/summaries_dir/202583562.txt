quantum counterfactual communication is the recently - proposed idea of using quantum mechanics to send messages between two parties without any particles travelling between them . while this novel idea has excited massive interest , both for potential ` un - hackable ' communications , and insight into the foundations of quantum mechanics , it has been asked whether the phenomena is truly quantum at all , or could be performed classically . we examine the idea of counterfactuality , both classically and for quantum particles , and look at the protocols proposed so far , and conclude it must , at least to strictest definitions of particle quantisation needed , be quantum .
