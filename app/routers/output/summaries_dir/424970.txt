recently , an information theoretical model for quantum secret sharing ( qss ) schemes was introduced . by using this model , we prove that pure state quantum threshold schemes ( qts ) can be constructed from quantum mds codes and vice versa . in particular , we consider stabilizer codes and give a constructive proof of their relation with qts . furthermore , we reformulate the monotone span program ( msp ) construction according to the information theoretical model and check the recoverability and secrecy requirement . finally , we consider qss schemes which are based on quantum teleportation .
