a framework for simulating the elastic - wave modes in waveguides , taking into account the full tensorial nature of the stiffness tensor , is presented and implemented in the open - source finite element solver , fenics . various approximations of the elastic wave equation used in the stimulated brillouin scattering literature are implemented and their validity and applicability are discussed . the elastic mode - solver is also coupled with an electromagnetic counterpart to study the influence of elastic anisotropies on brillouin gain .
