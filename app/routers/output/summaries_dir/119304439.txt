we study several classical like properties of q - deformed nonlinear coherent states as well as nonclassical behaviours of q - deformed version of the schrodinger cat states in noncommutative space . coherent states in q - deformed space are found to be minimum uncertainty states together with the squeezed photon distributions unlike the ordinary systems , where the photon distributions are always poissonian . several advantages of utilising cat states in noncommutative space over the standard quantum mechanical spaces have been reported here . for instance , the q - deformed parameter has been utilised to improve the squeezing of the quadrature beyond the ordinary case . most importantly , the parameter provides an extra degree of freedom by which we achieve both quadrature squeezed and number squeezed cat states at the same time in a single system , which is impossible to achieve from ordinary cat states .
