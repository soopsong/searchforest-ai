multi - photon and quantum communication experiments such as loophole - free bell tests and device independent quantum key distribution require entangled photon sources which display high coupling efficiency . in this paper we put forward a simple quantum theoretical model which allows the experimenter to design a source with high pair coupling efficiency . in particular we apply this approach to a situation where high coupling has not been previously obtained : we demonstrate a symmetric coupling efficiency of more than 80 % in a highly frequency non - degenerate configuration . furthermore , we demonstrate this technique in a broad range of configurations , i.e. in continuous wave and pulsed pump regimes , and for different nonlinear crystals .
