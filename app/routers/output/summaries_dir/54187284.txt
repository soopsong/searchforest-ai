when a single quantum of electromagnetic field excitation is added to the same spatio - temporal mode of a coherent state , a new field state is generated that exhibits intermediate properties between those of the two parents . such a single - photon - added coherent state is obtained by the action of the photon creation operator on a coherent state and can thus be regarded as the result of the most elementary excitation process of a classical light field . here we present and describe in depth the experimental realization of such states and their complete analysis by means of a novel ultrafast , time - domain , quantum homodyne tomography technique clearly revealing their non - classical character .
