fusion frames enable signal decompositions into weighted linear subspace components . for positive integers p , we introduce p - fusion frames , a sharpening of the notion of fusion frames . tight p - fusion frames are closely related to the classical notions of designs and cubature formulas in grassmann spaces and are analyzed with methods from harmonic analysis in the grassmannians . we define the p - fusion frame potential , derive bounds for its value , and discuss the connections to tight p - fusion frames .
