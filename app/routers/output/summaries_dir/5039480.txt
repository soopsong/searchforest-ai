conditional quantum optical processes enable a wide range of technologies from generation of highly non - classical states to implementation of quantum logic operations . the process fidelity that can be achieved in a realistic implementation depends on a number of system parameters . here we experimentally examine fock - state filtration , a canonical example of a broad class of conditional quantum operations acting on a single optical field mode . this operation is based upon interference of the mode to be manipulated with an auxiliary single - photon state at a beam splitter , resulting in the entanglement of the two output modes . a conditional projective measurement onto a single photon at one output mode heralds the success of the process . this operation , which implements a measurement - induced nonlinearity , is capable of suppressing particular photon - number probability amplitudes of an arbitrary quantum state . we employ coherent - state process tomography to determine the precise operation realized in our experiment . to identify the key sources of experimental imperfection , we develop a model of the process and identify three main contributions that significantly hamper its efficacy . the reconstructed tensor is compared with a model of the process taking into account sources of experimental imperfection with fidelity better than 0.95 . this enables us to identify three key challenges to overcome in realizing a filter with high fidelity - namely the single - photon nature of the auxiliary state , high - mode overlap , and the need for number resolving detection when heralding . the results show that the filter does indeed exhibit a nonlinear response as a function of input photon number and preserves the phase relation between fock layers of the output state , providing promise for future applications .
