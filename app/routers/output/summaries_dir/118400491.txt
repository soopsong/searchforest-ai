we analyze the dynamics and final populations in a landau - zener problem for a two level system ( or qubit ) when this system interacts with one harmonic oscillator mode that is initially set to a finite - temperature thermal equilibrium state . the harmonic oscillator could represent an external mode that is strongly coupled to the qubit , e.g. an ionic oscillation mode in a molecule , or it could represent a prototypical uncontrolled environment . we analyze the qubit 's occupation probabilities at the final time in a number of different regimes , varying the qubit and oscillator frequencies , their coupling strength and the temperature . in particular we find some surprising non - monotonic dependence on the coupling strength and temperature .
