ground state cooling of mechanical resonator is a way to generate macroscopic quantum states . here we present a study of optomechanical cooling under the drive of square pulses without smooth profile . by illustrating the dynamical processes of cooling , we show how to choose the amplitudes and durations of square pulses , as well as the intervals between them , so that a mechanical resonator can be quickly cooled down to its ground state . compared with the cooling under a continuous - wave drive field , the ground state cooling of a mechanical resonator can be performed more efficiently and flexibly by using square pulse drives . at certain times of such cooling process , the thermal phonon number under square pulse drives can become even lower than the theoretical limit for the cooling with a continuous - wave drive field of the same amplitude .
