we investigate two schemes of the quantum teleportation with a $ w$ state , which belongs to a different class from a greenberger - horne - zeilinger class . in the first scheme , the $ w$ state is shared by three parties one of whom , called a sender , performs a bell measurement . it is shown that quantum information of an unknown state is split between two parties and recovered with a certain probability . in the second scheme , a sender takes two particles of the $ w$ state and performs positive operator valued measurements in two ways . for two schemes , we calculate the success probability and the average fidelity . we show that the average fidelity of the second scheme can not exceed that of the first one .
