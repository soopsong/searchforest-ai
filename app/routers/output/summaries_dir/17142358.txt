a markovian model for a quantum automata , i.e. an open quantum dynamical discrete - time system with input and output channels and a feedback , is described . a dynamical theory of quantum discrete - time adaptive measurements and multi - stage quantum statistical decisions is developed and applied to the optimal feedback control problem for the quantum dynamical objects . quantum analogies of stratonovich non - stationary filtering , and bellman quantum dynamical programming in the discrete time are derived . a gaussian langevin model of the quantum one - dimensional linear markovian dynamical system matched with a quantum linear transmission line as an input - output quantum noisy channel is studied . the optimal quantum multi - stage decision rule consisting of a classical linear optimal control strategy and the quantum optimal filtering of the noise is found . the latter contains the optimal quantum coherent measurement on the output of the line and the recursive processing by the kalman filter . a time - continuous limit of the above model is considered , and the quantum nondemolition measurement , time - continuous filtering and the optimal dynamical programming are found in this limit . all the results are illustrated by an example of the optimal control problem for a quantum open oscillator matched to a quantum transmission line .
