we present an all - fibre source of high - purity heralded single photons with an integrated conditional optical gate that reduces uncorrelated noise by almost an order of magnitude . generating photon pairs by four - wave mixing in photonic crystal fibre , we observe with the noise gate active a factor of 7 reduction in the rate of single counts in the heralded channel with no measurable drop in coincidence count rate . in contrast to electronic post - selection of coincidence events , the real reduction in the flux of unwanted photons is beneficial for example to avoid bleaching light - sensitive samples or in generating entangled states .
