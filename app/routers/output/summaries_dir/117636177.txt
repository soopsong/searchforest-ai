we present a complete method to characterize multiphoton detectors with a small overall detection efficiency . we do this by separating the nonlinear action of the multiphoton detection event from linear losses in the detector . such a characterization is a necessary step for quantum information protocols with single and multiphoton detectors and can provide quantitative information to understand the underlying physics of a given detector . this characterization is applied to a superconducting multiphoton nanodetector , consisting of an nbn nanowire with a bowtie - shaped subwavelength constriction . depending on the bias current , this detector has regimes with single and multiphoton sensitivity . we present the first full experimental characterization of such a detector .
