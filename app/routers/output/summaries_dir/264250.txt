we present a quantum swap gate valid for quantum systems of an arbitrary dimension . the gate generalizes the cnot implementation of the swap gate for qubits and keeps its most important properties , like symmetry and simplicity . we only use three copies of the same controlled qudit gate . this gate can be built with two standard higher - dimensional operations , the quantum fourier transform and the d - dimensional version of the cz gate .
