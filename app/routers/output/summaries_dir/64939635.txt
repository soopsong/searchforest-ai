a scheme for secure multiparty quantum summation was proposed by run - hau shi et al . ,(scientific reports , 6:19655 , doi:10.1038 / srep19655 ) . ibm corporation has released a superconductivity based 5-qubit quantum computer named"quantum experience"and placed it on"cloud " . in this paper we take advantage of the online availability of this real quantum processor(ibmqx2 ) and carry out the above protocol that has never been experimentally demonstrated earlier . here , we set up experiments for secure quantum summation of one - qubit secret states . besides , we propose a protocol for square and cubic summation and also simulate the proposed protocol for both cases . experimental implementation of secure multiparty quantum summation protocol for two or more qubit secret state and the proposed protocol for square(and cubic ) summation are not possible using the available 5-qubit quantum processor(ibmqx2 ) . ibm has recently placed a 16-qubit quantum processor(ibmqx3 ) on the cloud but it is still not accessible for all users . we describe a simulation for two and three qubit secret state and proposed protocol for square(and cubic ) summation using a simulator(custom topology ) which is provided by ibm corporation .
