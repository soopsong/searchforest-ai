we study the unconventional photon blockade , recently proposed for a coupled - cavity system , in presence of input and output quantum fields . mixing of the input or output channels still allows strong photon antibunching of the output field , but for optimal values of the system parameters that differ substantially from those that maximize antibunching of the intracavity field . this result shows that the specific input - output geometry in a photonic system determines the optimal design in view of single - photon device operation . we provide a compact analytical formula that allows finding the optimal parameters for each specific system geometry .
