we describe exchange - only universal quantum computation and leakage reduction in the 3-qubit decoherence free subsystem ( dfs ) . we discuss the angular momentum structure of the dfs , the proper forms for the dfs cnot and leakage reduction operators in the total angular momentum basis , and new exchange - only pulse sequences for the cnot and leakage reduction operators . our new dfs cnot sequence requires 22 pulses in 13 time steps . the dfs leakage reduction sequence , the first explicit leakage reduction sequence of its kind , requires 30 pulses in 20 time steps . although the search for sequences was performed numerically using a genetic algorithm , the solutions presented here are exact , with closed - form expressions .
