the concept of qudit ( a d - level system ) cluster state is proposed by generalizing the qubit cluster state ( phys . rev . lett . \textbf{86 } , 910 ( 2001 ) ) according to the finite dimensional representations of quantum plane algebra . we demonstrate their quantum correlations and prove a theorem which guarantees the availability of the qudit cluster states in quantum computation . we explicitly construct the network to show the universality of the one - way computer based on the defined qudit cluster states and single - qudit measurement . and the corresponding protocol of implementing one - way quantum computer can be suggested with the high dimensional"ising"model which can be found in many magnetic systems .
