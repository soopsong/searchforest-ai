we present a method to engineer the frequency splitting of polarization eigenmodes in fiber fabry - perot ( ffp ) cavities . using specific pattern of multiple co$_2 $ laser pulses , we machine paraboloidal micromirrors with controlled elliptical shape in a large range of radius of curvature . this method is versatile and can be used to produce cavities with maximized or near - zero polarization mode splitting . in addition , we realize dual - wavelength ffp cavities with finesse exceeding $ 40\,000 $ at 780$\,$nm and at 1559$\,$nm in the telecom range . we provide direct evidence that the birefringent frequency splitting in ffp cavities is governed only by the geometrical shape of the mirrors , and that the astigmatism of the cavity modes needs to be taken into account for specific cavities .
