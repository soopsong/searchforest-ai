we report on measurements of the binding energies of several weakly bound vibrational states of the paramagnetic $ ^{174}$yb$^{6}$li molecule in the electronic ground state using two - photon spectroscopy in an ultracold atomic mixture confined in an optical dipole trap . we theoretically analyze the experimental spectrum to obtain an accurate description of the long - range potential of the ground state molecule . based on the measured binding energies , we arrive at an improved value of the interspecies $ s$-wave scattering length $ a_{s0}=30 $ $ a_0$. employing coherent two - photon spectroscopy we also observe the creation of ' ' dark ' ' atom - molecule superposition states in the heteronuclear yb - li system . this work is an important step towards the efficient production of ultracold ybli molecules via association from an ultracold atomic mixture .
