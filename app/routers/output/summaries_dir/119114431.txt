the non - integrable dicke model and its integrable approximation , the tavis - cummings ( tc ) model , are studied as functions of both the coupling constant and the excitation energy . the present contribution extends the analysis presented in the previous paper by focusing on the statistical properties of the quantum fluctuations in the energy spectrum and their relation with the excited state quantum phase transitions ( esqpt ) . these properties are compared with the dynamics observed in the semi - classical versions of the models . the presence of chaos for different energies and coupling constants is exhibited , employing poincar\'e sections and peres lattices in the classical and quantum versions , respectively . a clear correspondence between the classical and quantum result is found for systems containing between $ \mathcal{n } = 80 $ to $ 200 $ atoms . a measure of the wigner character of the energy spectrum for different couplings and energy intervals is also presented employing the statistical anderson - darling test . it is found that in the dicke model , for any coupling , a low energy regime with regular states is always present . the richness of the onset of chaos is discussed both for finite quantum systems and for the semi - classical limit , which is exact when the number of atoms in the system tends to infinite .
