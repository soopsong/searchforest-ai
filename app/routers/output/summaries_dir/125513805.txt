squeezed vacuum states enable optical measurements below the quantum limit and hence are a valuable resource for applications in quantum metrology and also quantum communication . however , most available sources require high pump powers in the milliwatt range and large setups , which hinders real world applications . furthermore , degenerate operation of such systems presents a challenge . here , we use a compact crystalline whispering gallery mode resonator made of lithium niobate as a degenerate parametric oscillator . we demonstrate about 1.4 db noise reduction below the shot noise level for only 300 $ \mu\text{w}$ of pump power in degenerate single mode operation . furthermore , we report a record pump threshold as low as 1.35 $ \mu\text{w}$. our results show that the whispering gallery based approach presents a promising platform for a compact and efficient source for nonclassical light .
