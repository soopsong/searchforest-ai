the dynamics of a three - level atom in a cascade configuration with both transitions coupled to a single structured reservoir of quantized field modes is treated using laplace transform methods applied to the coupled amplitude equations . results are also obtained from master equations by two different approaches , that is , involving either pseudomodes or quasimodes . two different types of reservoir are considered , namely a high - q cavity and a photonic band - gap system , in which the respective reservoir structure functions involve lorentzians . non - resonant transitions are included in the model . in all cases non - markovian behaviour for the atomic system can be found , such as oscillatory decay for the high - q cavity case and population trapping for the photonic band - gap case . in the master equation approaches , the atomic system is augmented by a small number of pseudomodes or quasimodes , which in the quasimode approach themselves undergo markovian relaxation into a flat reservoir of continuum quasimodes . results from these methods are found to be identical to those from the laplace transform method including two - photon excitation of the reservoir with both emitting sequences . this shows that complicated non - markovian decays of an atomic system into structured em field reservoirs can be described by markovian models for the atomic system coupled to a small number of pseudomodes or quasimodes .
