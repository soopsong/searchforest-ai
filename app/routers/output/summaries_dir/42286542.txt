in this paper we describe , implement , and test the performance of distributed memory simulations of quantum circuits on the msu laconia top500 supercomputer . using openmp and mpi hybrid parallelization , we first use a distributed matrix - vector multiplication with one - dimensional partitioning and discuss the shortcomings of this method due to the exponential memory requirements in simulating quantum computers . we then describe a more efficient method that stores only the $ 2^n$ amplitudes of the $ n$ qubit state vector $ |\psi\rangle$ and optimize its single node performance . in our multi - node implementation , we use a single amplitude communication protocol that maximizes the number of qubits able to be simulated and minimizes the ratio of qubits that require communication to those that do not , and we present an algorithm for efficiently determining communication pairs among processors . we simulate up to 30 qubits on a single node and 33 qubits with the state vector partitioned across 64 nodes . lastly , we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of our communication scheme , propose potential improvements , and describe other optimizations such as storing the state vector non - sequentially in memory to map communication requirements to idle qubits in the circuit .
