in this article we present a general security strategy for quantum secret sharing ( qss ) protocols based on the hbb scheme presented by hillery , bu\v{z}ek and berthiaume [ phys . rev a \textbf{59 } , 1829 ( 1999 ) ] . we focus on a generalization of the hbb protocol to $ n$ communication parties thus including $ n$-partite ghz states . we show that the multipartite version of the hbb scheme is insecure in certain settings and impractical when going to large $ n$. to provide security for such qss schemes in general we use the framework presented by some of the authors [ m. huber , f. minert , a. gabriel , b. c. hiesmayr , phys . rev . lett . \textbf{104 } , 210501 ( 2010 ) ] to detect certain genuine $ n$ partite entanglement between the communication parties . in particular , we present a simple inequality which tests the security .
