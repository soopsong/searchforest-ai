a scheme for arbitrary quantum state engineering ( qse ) in three - state systems is proposed . firstly , starting from a set of complete orthogonal time - dependent basis with undetermined coefficients , a time - dependent hamiltonian is derived via counterdiabatic driving for the purpose of guiding the system to attain an arbitrary target state at a predefined time . then , on request of the assumed target states , two single - mode driving protocols and a multi - mode driving protocol are proposed as examples to discuss the validity of the qse scheme . the result of comparison between single - mode driving and multi - mode driving shows that multi - mode driving seems to have a wider rang of application prospect because it can drive the system to an arbitrary target state from an arbitrary initial state also at a predefined time even without the use of microwave fields for the transition between the two ground states . moreover , for the purpose of discussion in the scheme 's feasibility in practice , a polynomial ansatz as the simplest exampleis used to fix the pulses . the result shows that the pulses designed to implement the protocols are not hard to be realized in practice . at the end , qse in higher - dimensional systems is also discussed in brief as a generalization example of the scheme .
