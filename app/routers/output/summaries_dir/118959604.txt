we consider a class of pure black hole microstates and demonstrate that they can be made escapable by turning on certain double trace deformations in the cft . these microstates are dual to bcft states prepared via a euclidean path integral starting from a boundary in euclidean time . these states are dual to black holes in the bulk with an end - of - the - world brane ; a codimension one timelike boundary of the spacetime behind the horizon . we show that by tuning the sign of the coupling of the double trace operator to the boundary conditions on the brane the deformation injects negative energy into the black hole causing a time advance for signals behind the horizon . we demonstrate how the property of escapability in the considered microstates follows immediately from the traversability of deformed wormholes . we briefly comment on reconstruction of the black hole interior and state dependence .
