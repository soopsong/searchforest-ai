in theory , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) provides information - theoretic security based on the laws of physics . owing to the imperfections of real - life implementations , however , there is a big gap between the theory and practice of qkd , which has been recently exploited by several quantum hacking activities . to fill this gap , a novel approach , called measurement - device - independent qkd ( mdiqkd ) , has been proposed . it can remove all side - channels from the measurement unit , arguably the most vulnerable part in qkd systems , thus offering a clear avenue towards secure qkd realisations . here , we review the latest developments in the framework of mdiqkd , together with its assumptions , strengths and weaknesses .
