periodically - tapered - waveguides technique is an emerging potential route to establish quasi - phase - matching schemes for efficient on - demand parametric interactions in third - order nonlinear materials . in this paper , i investigate this method in enhancing spontaneous photon - pairs emission in fibres and planar waveguides with sinusoidally - varying cross sections . i have developed a general robust quantum model to study this process under continuous or pulsed - pump excitations . the model shows a great enhancement in photon - pairs generation in waveguides with a small number of tapering periods that are feasible via the current fabrication technologies . i envisage that this work will open a new area of research to investigate how the tapering patterns can be fully optimised to tailor the spectral properties of the output photons in third - order nonlinear guided structures .
