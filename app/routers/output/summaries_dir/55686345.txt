we propose a feasible scheme to cool down a mechanical resonator ( mr ) in a three - mirror cavity optomechanical system with controllable external optical drives . under the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation , the whole dynamics of the mechanical resonator and cavities is reduced to that of a time - dependent harmonic oscillator , whose effective frequency can be controlled through the optical driving fields . the fast cooling of the mr can be realized by controlling the amplitude of the optical drives . significantly , we further show that the ground - state cooling may be achieved via the three - mirror cavity optomechanical system without the resolved sideband condition .
