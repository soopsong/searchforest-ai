the element distinctness problem is the problem of determining whether the elements of a list are distinct , that is , if $ x=(x_1, ... ,x_n)$ is a list with $ n$ elements , we ask whether the elements of $ x$ are distinct or not . the solution in a classical computer requires $ n$ queries because it uses sorting to check whether there are equal elements . in the quantum case , it is possible to solve the problem in $ o(n^{2/3})$ queries . there is an extension which asks whether there are $ k$ colliding elements , known as element $ k$-distinctness problem . this work obtains optimal values of two critical parameters of ambainis ' seminal quantum algorithm [ siam j.~comput . , 37 , 210 - 239 , 2007 ] . the first critical parameter is the number of repetitions of the algorithm 's main block , which inverts the phase of the marked elements and calls a subroutine . the second parameter is the number of quantum walk steps interlaced by oracle queries . we show that , when the optimal values of the parameters are used , the algorithm 's success probability is $ 1-o(n^{1/(k+1)})$ , quickly approaching 1 . the specification of the exact running time and success probability is important in practical applications of this algorithm .
