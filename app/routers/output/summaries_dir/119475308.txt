the collective behavior of ensembles of atoms has been studied in - depth since the seminal paper of dicke [ r. h. dicke , phys . rev . 93 , 99 ( 1954 ) ] , where he demonstrated that a group of emitters in collective states is able to radiate with increased intensity and modified decay rates in particular directions , a phenomenon which he called superradiance . here , we show that the fundamental setup of two atoms coupled to a single - mode cavity can be distinctly exceeding the free - space superradiant behavior , a phenomenon which we call hyperradiance . the effect is accompanied by strong quantum fluctuations and surprisingly arises for atoms radiating out - of - phase , an alleged non - ideal condition , where one expects subradiance . we are able to explain the onset of hyperradiance in a transparent way by a photon cascade taking place among manifolds of dicke states with different photon numbers under particular out - of - phase coupling conditions . the theoretical results can be realized with current technology and thus should stimulate future experiments .
