the importance of feedback control is being increasingly appreciated in quantum physics and applications . this paper describes the use of optimal control methods in the design of quantum feedback control systems , and in particular the paper formulates and solves a risk - sensitive optimal control problem . the resulting risk - sensitive optimal control is given in terms of a new unnormalized conditional state , whose dynamics include the cost function used to specify the performance objective . the risk - sensitive conditional dynamic equation describes the evolution of our { \em knowledge } of the quantum system tempered by our { \em purpose } for the controlled quantum system . robustness properties of risk - sensitive controllers are discussed , and an example is provided .
