as discovered by p. w. anderson , excitations do not propagate freely in a disordered lattice , but , due to destructive interference , they localise . as a consequence when an atom interacts with a disordered lattice one indeed observes , a non - trivial excitation exchange between atom and lattice . such non - trivial atomic dynamics will in general be characterised also by a non - trivial quantum information backflow , a clear signature of non - markovian dynamics . to investigate the above scenario we consider a quantum emitter , or atom , weakly coupled to a uniform coupled - cavity array ( cca ) . if initially excited , in the absence of disorder , the emitter undergoes a markovian spontaneous emission by releasing all its excitation into the cca ( initially in its vacuum state ) . by introducing static disorder in the cca the field normal modes become anderson - localized , giving rise to a non - markovian atomic dynamics . we show the existence of a functional relationship between a rigorous measure of quantum non - markovianity and the cca localization . we furthermore show that the average non - markovianity of the atomic dynamics is well - described by a phenomenological model in which the atom is coupled , at the same time , to a single mode and to a standard - markovian - dissipative bath .
