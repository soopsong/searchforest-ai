parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) is one of the most widely used methods to create pure single - photon states for quantum information applications . however little attention has been paid to higher - order photon components in the pdc process , yet these ultimately limit the prospects of generating single - photons of high quality . in this paper we investigate the impacts of higher - order photon components and multiple frequency modes on the heralding rates and single - photon fidelities . this enables us to determine the limits of pdc sources for single - photon generation . our results show that a perfectly single - mode pdc source in conjunction with a photon - number resolving detector is ultimately capable of creating single - photon fock states with unit fidelity and a maximal state creation probability of 25 % . hence an array of 17 switched sources is required to build a deterministic ( > 99 % emission probability ) pure single - photon source .
