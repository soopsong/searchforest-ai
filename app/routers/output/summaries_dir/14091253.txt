in this paper we isolate the combinatorial property responsible ( at least in part ) for the computational speedups recently observed in some quantum walk algorithms . we find that continuous - time quantum walks can exploit the covering space property of certain graphs . we demonstrate that a quantum walk on a graph y which covers a smaller graph x can be equivalent to a quantum walk on the smaller graph x. this equivalence occurs only when the walk begins on certain initial states , fibre - constant states , which respect the graph covering space structure . we illustrate these observations with walks on cayley graphs ; we show that walks on fibre - constant initial states for cayley graphs are equivalent to walks on the induced schreier graph . we also consider the problem of constructing efficient gate sequences simulating the time evolution of a continuous - time quantum walk . for the case of the walk on the m - torus graph t^m on 2^n vertices we construct a gate sequence which uses o(\poly(n ) ) gates which is independent of the time t the walk is simulated for ( and so the sequence can simulate the walk for exponential times ) . we argue that there exists a wide class of nontrivial operators based on quantum walks on graphs which can be measured efficiently . we introduce a new general class of computational problems , hiddencover , which includes a variant of the general hidden subgroup problem as a subclass . we argue that quantum computers ought to be able to utilise covering space structures to efficiently solve hiddencover problems .
