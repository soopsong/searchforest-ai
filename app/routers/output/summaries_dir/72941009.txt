the theory of quantum cryptography aims to guarantee unconditional information - theoretic security against an omnipotent eavesdropper . in many practical scenarios , however , the assumption of an all - powerful adversary is excessive and can be relaxed considerably . in this paper we study secret key distillation across a lossy and noisy quantum wiretap channel between alice and bob , with a separately parameterized realistically lossy quantum channel to the eavesdropper eve . we show that under such restricted eavesdropping , the key rates achievable can exceed the secret key distillation capacity against an unrestricted eavesdropper in the quantum wiretap channel . further , we show upper bounds on the key rates based on the relative entropy of entanglement . this simple restricted eavesdropping model is widely applicable , e.g. , to free - space quantum optical communication , where realistic collection of light by eve is limited by the finite size of her optical aperture . future work will include calculating bounds on the amount of light eve can collect under various realistic scenarios .
