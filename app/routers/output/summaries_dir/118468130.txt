we study time ordering corrections to the description of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) , four wave mixing ( sfwm ) and frequency conversion ( fc ) using the magnus expansion . analytic approximations to the evolution operator that are unitary are obtained . they are gaussian preserving , and allow us to understand order - by - order the effects of time ordering . we show that the corrections due to time ordering vanish exactly if the phase matching function is sufficiently broad . the calculation of the effects of time ordering on the joint spectral amplitude of the photons generated in spontaneous spdc and sfwm are reduced to quadrature .
