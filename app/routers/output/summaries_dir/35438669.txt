we present an experimental realization of resonance fluorescence in squeezed vacuum . we strongly couple microwave - frequency squeezed light to a superconducting artificial atom and detect the resulting fluorescence with high resolution enabled by a broadband traveling - wave parametric amplifier . we investigate the fluorescence spectra in the weak and strong driving regimes , observing up to 3.1 db of reduction of the fluorescence linewidth below the ordinary vacuum level and a dramatic dependence of the mollow triplet spectrum on the relative phase of the driving and squeezed vacuum fields . our results are in excellent agreement with predictions for spectra produced by a two - level atom in squeezed vacuum [ phys . rev . lett . \textbf{58 } , 2539 - 2542 ( 1987 ) ] , demonstrating that resonance fluorescence offers a resource - efficient means to characterize squeezing in cryogenic environments .
