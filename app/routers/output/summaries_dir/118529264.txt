in this manuscript we study the behaviour of the entanglement measure dubbed negativity in the context of the toric code model . using a method introduced recently by calabrese , cardy and tonni [ phys . rev . lett . 109 , 130502 ( 2012 ) ] , we obtain an exact expression which illustrates how the non - local correlations present in a topologically ordered state reflect in the behaviour of the negativity of the system . we find that the negativity has a leading area - law contribution , if the subsystems are in direct contact with one another ( as expected in a zero - range correlated model ) . we also find a topological contribution directly related to the topological entropy , provided that the partitions are topologically non - trivial in both directions on a torus . we also show that the negativity captures only quantum contributions to the entanglement . indeed , we show that the negativity vanishes identically for the classical topologically ordered 8-vertex model , which on the contrary exhibits a finite von neumann entropy , inclusive of topological correction .
