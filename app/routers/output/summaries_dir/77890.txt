we analyze in detail the discrete -- time quantum walk on the line by separating the quantum evolution equation into markovian and interference terms . as a result of this separation , it is possible to show analytically that the quadratic increase in the variance of the quantum walker 's position with time is a direct consequence of the coherence of the quantum evolution . if the evolution is decoherent , as in the classical case , the variance is shown to increase linearly with time , as expected . furthermore we show that this system has an evolution operator analogous to that of a resonant quantum kicked rotor . as this rotator may be described through a quantum computational algorithm , one may employ this algorithm to describe the time evolution of the quantum walker .
