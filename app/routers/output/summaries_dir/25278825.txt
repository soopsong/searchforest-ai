in this paper , we investigate the fundamental limits on how the inter- spike time of a neuron oscillator can be perturbed by the application of a bounded external control input ( a current stimulus ) with zero net electric charge accumulation . we use phase models to study the dynamics of neurons and derive charge - balanced controls that achieve the minimum and maximum inter - spike times for a given bound on the control amplitude . our derivation is valid for any arbitrary shape of the phase response curve and for any value of the given control amplitude bound . in addition , we characterize the change in the structures of the charge - balanced time - optimal controls with the allowable control amplitude . we demonstrate the applicability of the derived optimal control laws by applying them to mathematically ideal and experimentally observed neuron phase models , including the widely - studied hodgkin - huxley phase model , and by verifying them with the corresponding original full state - space models . this work addresses a fundamental problem in the field of neural control and provides a theoretical investigation to the optimal control of oscillatory systems .
