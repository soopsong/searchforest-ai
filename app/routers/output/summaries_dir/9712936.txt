in this work , we extend the idea of quantum markov chains [ s. gudder . quantum markov chains . j. math . phys . , 49(7 ) , 2008 ] in order to propose quantum hidden markov models ( qhmms ) . for that , we use the notions of transition operation matrices ( tom ) and vector states , which are an extension of classical stochastic matrices and probability distributions . our main result is the mealy qhmm formulation and proofs of algorithms needed for application of this model : forward for general case and vitterbi for a restricted class of qhmms .
