the passive states of a quantum system minimize the average energy among all the states with a given spectrum . we prove that passive states are the optimal inputs of single - jump lossy quantum channels . these channels arise from a weak interaction of the quantum system of interest with a large markovian bath in its ground state , such that the interaction hamiltonian couples only consecutive energy eigenstates of the system . we prove that the output generated by any input state $ \rho$ majorizes the output generated by the passive input state $ \rho_0 $ with the same spectrum of $ \rho$. then , the output generated by $ \rho$ can be obtained applying a random unitary operation to the output generated by $ \rho_0$. this is an extension of de palma et al . , ieee trans . inf . theory 62 , 2895 ( 2016 ) , where the same result is proved for one - mode bosonic gaussian channels . we also prove that for finite temperature this optimality property can fail already in a two - level system , where the best input is a coherent superposition of the two energy eigenstates .
