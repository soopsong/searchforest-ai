we address an information - theoretic approach to noise and disturbance in quantum measurements . properties of corresponding probability distributions are characterized by means of both the r\'{e}nyi and tsallis entropies . related information - theoretic measures of noise and disturbance are introduced . these definitions are based on the concept of conditional entropy . to motivate introduced measures , some important properties of the conditional r\'{e}nyi and tsallis entropies are discussed . there exist several formulations of entropic uncertainty relations for a pair of observables . trade - off relations for noise and disturbance are derived on the base of known formulations of such a kind .
