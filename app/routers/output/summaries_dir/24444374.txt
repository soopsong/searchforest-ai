we have produced high transmission sub - wavelength tapered optical fibers for the purpose of whispering gallery mode coupling in fused silica microcavities at 780 nm . a detailed analysis of the fiber transmittance evolution during tapering is demonstrated to reflect precisely the mode coupling and cutoff in the fiber . this allows to control the final size , the number of guided modes and their effective index . these results are checked by evanescent wave mapping measurements on the resulting taper .
