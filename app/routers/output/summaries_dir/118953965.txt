ultracold polar molecules are an ideal platform for studying many - body physics with long - range dipolar interactions . experiments in this field have progressed enormously , and several groups are pursuing advanced apparatus for manipulation of molecules with electric fields as well as single - atom - resolved in situ detection . such detection has become ubiquitous for atoms in optical lattices and tweezer arrays , but has yet to be demonstrated for ultracold polar molecules . here we present a proposal for the implementation of quantum gas microscopy for polar molecules , and specifically discuss a technique for spin - resolved molecular detection . we use numerical simulation of spin dynamics of lattice - confined polar molecules to show how such a scheme would be of utility in a spin - diffusion experiment .
