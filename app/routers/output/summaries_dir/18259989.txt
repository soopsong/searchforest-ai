we demonstrate three and four input multiports in a three dimensional glass platform , fabricated using the femtosecond laser direct - write technique . hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interference is observed and a full quantum characterisation is performed , obtaining two photon correlation matrices for all combinations of input and output ports . for the three - port case , the quantum visibilities are accurately predicted solely from measurement of the classical coupling ratios .
