if the conditional information of a classical probability distribution of three random variables is zero , then it obeys a markov chain condition . if the conditional information is close to zero , then it is known that the distance ( minimum relative entropy ) of the distribution to the nearest markov chain distribution is precisely the conditional information . we prove here that this simple situation does not obtain for quantum conditional information . we show that for tri - partite quantum states the quantum conditional information is always a lower bound for the minimum relative entropy distance to a quantum markov chain state , but the distance can be much greater ; indeed the two quantities can be of different asymptotic order and may even differ by a dimensional factor .
