we consider three different communication tasks for quantum broadcast channels , and we determine the capacity region of a hadamard broadcast channel for these various tasks . we define a hadamard broadcast channel to be such that the channel from the sender to one of the receivers is entanglement - breaking and the channel from the sender to the other receiver is complementary to this one . as such , this channel is a quantum generalization of a degraded broadcast channel , which is well known in classical information theory . the first communication task we consider is classical communication to both receivers , the second is quantum communication to the stronger receiver and classical communication to other , and the third is entanglement - assisted classical communication to the stronger receiver and unassisted classical communication to the other . the structure of a hadamard broadcast channel plays a critical role in our analysis : the channel to the weaker receiver can be simulated by performing a measurement channel on the stronger receiver 's system , followed by a preparation channel . as such , we can incorporate the classical output of the measurement channel as an auxiliary variable and solve all three of the above capacities for hadamard broadcast channels , in this way avoiding known difficulties associated with quantum auxiliary variables .
