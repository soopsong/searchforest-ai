coupling a semiconducting nanowire to a microwave cavity provides a powerfull means to assess the presence or absence of isolated majorana fermions in the nanowire . these exotic bound states can cause a significant cavity frequency shift but also a strong cavity nonlinearity leading for instance to light squeezing . the dependence of these effects on the nanowire gate voltages gives direct signatures of the unique properties of majorana fermions , such as their self - adjoint character and their exponential confinement .
