we study the stochastic energetic exchanges in quantum heat engines . due to microreversibility , these obey a fluctuation relation , called the heat engine fluctuation relation , which implies the carnot bound : no machine can have an efficiency larger than carnot 's efficiency . the stochastic thermodynamics of a quantum heat engine ( including the joint statistics of heat and work and the statistics of efficiency ) is illustrated by means of an optimal two - qubit heat engine , where each qubit is coupled to a thermal bath and a two - qubit gate determines energy exchanges between the two qubits . we discuss possible solid state implementations with cooper pair boxes and flux qubits , quantum gate operations , and fast calorimetric on - chip measurements of single stochastic events .
