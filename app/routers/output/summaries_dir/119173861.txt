the problem of recovering a vector from the absolute values of its inner products against a family of measurement vectors has been well studied in mathematics and engineering . a generalization of this phase retrieval problem also exists in engineering : recovering a vector from measurements consisting of norms of its orthogonal projections onto a family of subspaces . there exist semidefinite programming algorithms to solve this problem , but much remains unknown for this more general case . can families of subspaces for which such measurements are injective be completely classified ? what is the minimal number of subspaces required to have injectivity ? how closely does this problem compare to the usual phase retrieval problem with families of measurement vectors ? in this paper , we answer or make incremental steps toward these questions . we provide several characterizations of subspaces which yield injective measurements , and through a concrete construction , we prove the surprising result that phase retrieval can be achieved with $ 2m-1 $ projections of arbitrary rank in $ \hh_m$. finally we present several open problems as we discuss issues unique to the phase retrieval problem with subspaces .
