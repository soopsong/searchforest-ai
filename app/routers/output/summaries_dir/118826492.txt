we consider the continuous - variable protocol of pirandola et al . [ nature photonics 9 , 397 - 402 ( 2015 ) , see also arxiv.1312.4104 ] where the secret - key is established by the measurement of an untrusted relay . in this network protocol , two authorized parties are connected to an untrusted relay by insecure quantum links . secret correlations are generated by a continuous - variable bell detection performed on incoming coherent states . in the present work we provide a detailed study of the symmetric configuration , where the relay is midway between the parties . we analyze symmetric eavesdropping strategies against the quantum links explicitly showing that , at fixed transmissivity and thermal noise , two - mode coherent attacks are optimal , manifestly outperforming one - mode collective attacks based on independent entangling cloners . such an advantage is shown both in terms of security threshold and secret - key rate .
