compiling quantum algorithms for near - term quantum computers ( accounting for connectivity and native gate alphabets ) is a major challenge that has received significant attention both by industry and academia . avoiding the exponential overhead of classical simulation of quantum dynamics will allow compilation of larger algorithms , and a strategy for this is to evaluate an algorithm 's cost on a quantum computer . to this end , we propose a variational hybrid quantum - classical algorithm called quantum - assisted quantum compiling ( qaqc ) . in qaqc , we use the overlap between a target unitary $ u$ and a trainable unitary $ v$ as the cost function to be evaluated on the quantum computer . more precisely , to ensure that qaqc scales well with problem size , our cost involves not only the global overlap $ { \rm tr } ( v^\dagger u)$ but also the local overlaps with respect to individual qubits . we introduce novel short - depth quantum circuits to quantify the terms in our cost function , and we prove that our cost can not be efficiently approximated with a classical algorithm under reasonable complexity assumptions . we present both gradient - free and gradient - based approaches to minimizing this cost . as a demonstration of qaqc , we compile various one - qubit gates on ibm 's and rigetti 's quantum computers into their respective native gate alphabets . furthermore , we successfully simulate qaqc up to a problem size of 9 qubits , and these simulations highlight both the scalability of our cost function as well as the noise resilience of qaqc . future applications of qaqc include algorithm depth compression , black - box compiling , noise mitigation , and benchmarking .
