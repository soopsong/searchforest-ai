we investigate the role of the collective antisymmetric state in entanglement creation by spontaneous emission in a system of two non - overlapping two - level atoms . we calculate and illustrate graphically populations of the collective atomic states and the wootters entanglement measure ( concurrence ) for two sets of initial atomic conditions . our calculations include the dipole - dipole interaction and a spatial separation between the atoms that the antisymmetric state of the system is included throughout even for small interatomic separations . it is shown that spontaneous emission can lead to a transient entanglement between the atoms even if the atoms were prepared initially in an unentangled state . we find that the ability of spontaneous emission to create the transient entanglement relies on the absence of population in the collective symmetric state of the system . for the initial state of only one atom excited , the entanglement builds up rapidly in time and reaches a maximum for the parameter values corresponding roughly to zero population in the symmetric state . on the other hand , for the initial condition of both atoms excited , the atoms remain unentangled until the symmetric state is depopulated . a simple physical interpretation of these results is given in terms of the diagonal states of the density matrix of the system . we also study entanglement creation in a system of two non - identical atoms of different transition frequencies . it is found that the entanglement between the atoms can be enhanced compared to that for identical atoms , and can decay with two different time scales resulting from the coherent transfer of the population from the symmetric to the antisymmetric state . in addition , we find that a decaying initial entanglement between the atoms can display a revival behaviour .
