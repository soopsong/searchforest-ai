a breadth - first search method for determining optimal 3-line circuits composed of quantum not , cnot , controlled - v and controlled - v+ ( ncv ) gates is introduced . results are presented for simple gate count and for technology motivated cost metrics . the optimal ncv circuits are also compared to ncv circuits derived from optimal not , cnot and toffoli ( nct ) gate circuits . the work presented here provides basic results and motivation for continued study of the direct synthesis of ncv circuits , and establishes relations between function realizations in different circuit cost metrics .
