we present an event - ready procedure that is capable of distilling gaussian two - mode entangled states from a supply of weakly entangled states that have become mixed in a decoherence process . this procedure relies on passive optical elements and photon detectors distinguishing the presence and the absence of photons , but does not make use of photon counters . we identify fixed points of the iteration map , and discuss in detail its convergence properties . necessary and sufficient criteria for the convergence to two - mode gaussian states are presented . on the basis of various examples we discuss the performance of the procedure as far as the increase of the degree of entanglement and two - mode squeezing is concerned . finally , we consider imperfect operations and outline the robustness of the scheme under non - unit detection efficiencies of the detectors . this analysis implies that the proposed protocol can be implemented with currently available technology and detector efficiencies .
