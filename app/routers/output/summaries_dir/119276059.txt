what is the relation between spin squeezing and entanglement ? to clarify this , we derive the full set of generalized spin squeezing inequalities for the detection of entanglement . these are inequalities for the mean values and variances of the collective angular momentum components j_k . they can be used for the experimental detection of entanglement in a system of spin-1/2 particles in which the spins can not be individually addressed . we present various sets of inequalities that can detect all entangled states that can be detected based on the knowledge of : ( i ) the mean values and variances of j_k in three orthogonal directions , or ( ii ) the variances of j_k in three orthogonal directions , or ( iii ) the mean values of j_k^2 in three orthogonal directions or ( iv ) the mean values and variances of j_k in arbitrary directions . we compare our inequalities to known spin squeezing entanglement criteria and discuss to which extent spin squeezing is related to entanglement in the reduced two - qubit states . finally , we apply our criteria for the detection of entanglement in spin models , showing that they can be used to detect bound entanglement in these systems .
