the asymmetric simple exclusion process is one of the most extensively studied models in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics . the macroscopic particle current produced in its steady state is directly related to the breaking of detailed balance , and is therefore a physical quantity of particular interest . in this paper , we build a matrix product ansatz which allows to access the exact statistics of the fluctuations of that current for finite sizes , as well as the probabilities of configurations conditioned on the mean current . we also show how this ansatz can be used for the periodic asep , and how it translates in the language of the xxz spin chain .
