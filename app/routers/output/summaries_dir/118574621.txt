improvements both in the photonic confinement and in the emitter design have led to a steady increase in the strength of the light - matter coupling in cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments . this has allowed to access interaction - dominated regimes in which the state of the system can only be described in terms of mixed light - matter excitations . here we show that , when the coupling between light and matter becomes strong enough , this picture breaks down , and light and matter degrees of freedom totally decouple . a striking consequence of such a counter - intuitive phenomenon is that the purcell effect is reversed and the spontaneous emission rate , usually thought to increase with the light - matter coupling strength , plummets instead for large enough couplings .
