we describe an efficient theoretical criterion , suitable for indistinguishable particles to quantify the quantum correlations of any pure two - fermion state , based on the slater rank concept . it represents the natural generalization of the linear entropy used to treat quantum entanglement in systems of non - identical particles . such a criterion is here applied to an electron - electron scattering in a two - dimensional system in order to perform a quantitative evaluation of the entanglement dynamics for various spin configurations and to compare the linear entropy with alternative approaches . our numerical results show the dependence of the entanglement evolution upon the initial state of the system and its spin components . the differences with previous analyses accomplished by using the von neumann entropy are discussed . the evaluation of the entanglement dynamics in terms of the linear entropy results to be much less demanding from the computational point of view , not requiring the diagonalization of the density matrix .
