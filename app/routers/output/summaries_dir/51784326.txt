we propose an efficient qubit initialization protocol based on a dissipative environment that can be dynamically adjusted . here the qubit is coupled to a thermal bath through a tunable harmonic oscillator . on - demand initialization is achieved by sweeping the oscillator rapidly into resonance with the qubit . this resonant coupling with the engineered environment induces fast relaxation to the ground state of the system , and a consecutive rapid sweep back to off resonance guarantees weak excess dissipation during quantum computations . we solve the corresponding quantum dynamics using a markovian master equation for the reduced density operator of the qubit - bath system . this allows us to optimize the parameters and the initialization protocol for the qubit . our analytical calculations show that the ground - state occupation of our system is well protected during the fast sweeps of the environmental coupling and , consequently , we obtain an estimate for the duration of our protocol by solving the transition rates between the low - energy eigenstates with the jacobian diagonalization method . our results suggest that the current experimental state of the art for the initialization speed of superconducting qubits at a given fidelity can be considerably improved .
