there has been significant interest recently in using complex quantum systems to create effective nonreciprocal dynamics . proposals have been put forward for the realization of artificial magnetic fields for photons and phonons ; experimental progress is fast making these proposals a reality . much work has concentrated on the use of such systems for controlling the flow of signals , e.g. , to create isolators or directional amplifiers for optical signals . in this paper , we build on this work but move in a different direction . we develop the theory of and discuss a potential realization for the controllable flow of thermal noise in quantum systems . we demonstrate theoretically that the unidirectional flow of thermal noise is possible within quantum cascaded systems . viewing an optomechanical platform as a cascaded system we here that one can ultimately control the direction of the flow of thermal noise . by appropriately engineering the mechanical resonator , which acts as an artificial reservoir , the flow of thermal noise can be constrained to a desired direction , yielding a thermal rectifier . the proposed quantum thermal noise rectifier could potentially be used to develop devices such as a thermal modulator , a thermal router , and a thermal amplifier for nanoelectronic devices and superconducting circuits .
