we present an example of quantum process tomography ( qpt ) performed on a single solid state qubit . the qubit used is two energy levels of the triplet state in the nitrogen - vacancy defect in diamond . quantum process tomography is applied to a qubit which has been allowed to decohere for three different time periods . in each case the process is found in terms of the chi matrix representation and the affine map representation . the discrepancy between experimentally estimated process and the closest physically valid process is noted . the results of qpt performed after three different decoherence times are used to find the error generators , or lindblad operators , for the system , using the technique introduced by boulant et al .
