interpretations of quantum mechanics ( qm ) , or proposals for underlying theories , that attempt to present a definite realist picture , such as bohmian mechanics , require strong non - local effects . naively , these effects would violate causality and contradict special relativity . however if the theory agrees with qm the violation can not be observed directly . here , we demonstrate experimentally such an effect : we steer the velocity and trajectory of a bohmian particle using a remote measurement . we use a pair of photons and entangle the spatial transverse position of one with the polarization of the other . the first photon is sent to a double - slit - like apparatus , where its trajectory is measured using the technique of weak measurements . the other photon is projected to a linear polarization state . the choice of polarization state , and the result , steer the first photon in the most intuitive sense of the word . the effect is indeed shown to be dramatic , while being easy to visualize . we discuss its strength and what are the conditions for it to occur .
