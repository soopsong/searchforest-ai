we analyze the optimal measurements accessing classical correlations in arbitrary two - qubit states . two - qubit states can be transformed into the canonical forms via local unitary operations . for the canonical forms , we investigate the probability distribution of the optimal measurements . the probability distribution of the optimal measurement is found to be centralized in the vicinity of a specific von neumann measurement , which we call the maximal - correlation - direction measurement ( mcdm ) . we prove that for the states with zero - discord and maximally mixed marginals , the mcdm is the very optimal measurement . furthermore , we give an upper bound of quantum discord based on the mcdm , and investigate its performance for approximating the quantum discord .
