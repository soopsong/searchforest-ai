we consider gaussian states of fermionic systems and study the action of the partial transposition on the density matrix . it is shown that , with a suitable choice of basis , these states are transformed into a linear combination of two gaussian operators that are uniquely defined in terms of the covariance matrix of the original state . in case of a reflection symmetric geometry , this result can be used to efficiently calculate a lower bound for a well - known entanglement measure , the logarithmic negativity . furthermore , exact expressions can be derived for traces involving integer powers of the partial transpose . the method can also be applied to the quantum ising chain and the results show perfect agreement with the predictions of conformal field theory .
