we investigate how to protect quantum correlations for two qubits each locally interacting with its own non - markovian environment by making use of bang - bang pulses . it is shown that the quantum discord dynamics presents the phenomenon of sudden change for some certain initial states . we also find that the amount of quantum correlation between two qubits can be improved by applying a train of pulses and protected more effectively with shorter interval pulses or longer reservoir correlation time .
