in the present work we investigate the existence of multiple nonequilibrium steady states in a coherently driven xy lattice of dissipative two - level systems . a commonly used mean - field ansatz , in which spatial correlations are neglected , predicts a bistable behavior with a sharp shift between low- and high - density states . in contrast one - dimensional matrix product methods reveal these effects to be artifacts of the mean - field approach , with both disappearing once correlations are taken fully into account . instead , a bunching - antibunching transition emerges . this indicates that alternative approaches should be considered for higher spatial dimensions , where classical simulations are currently infeasible . thus we propose a circuit qed quantum simulator implementable with current technology to enable an experimental investigation of the model considered .
