an exactly solvable model for the multi - level system interacting with several reservoirs at zero temperatures is presented . population decay rates and decoherence rates predicted by exact solution and several approximate master equations , which are widespread in physical literature , are compared . the space of parameters is classified with respect to different inequities between the exact and approximate rates .
