we present a high - efficiency multipartite entanglement purification protocol ( mepp ) for electron - spin systems in a greenberger - horne - zeilinger state based on their spins and their charges . our mepp contains two parts . the first part is our normal mepp with which the parties can obtain a high - fidelity n - electron ensemble directly , similar to the mepp with controlled - not gates . the second one is our recycling mepp with entanglement link from n'-electron subsystems ( 2 < n'<n ) . it is interesting to show that the n'-electron subsystems can be obtained efficiently by measuring the electrons with potential bit - flip errors from the instances which are useless and are just discarded in all existing conventional mepps . combining these two parts , our mepp has the advantage of the efficiency higher than other mepps largely for electron - spin systems .
