decoherence of quantum states is a major hurdle towards scalable and reliable quantum computing . lower decoherence ( i.e. , higher fidelity ) can alleviate the error correction overhead and obviate the need for energy - intensive noise reduction techniques e.g. , cryogenic cooling . in this paper , we performed a noise - induced decoherence analysis of single and multi - qubit quantum gates using physics - based simulations . the analysis indicates that ( i ) decoherence depends on the input state and the gate type . larger number of $ |1\rangle$ states worsen the decoherence ; ( ii ) amplitude damping is more detrimental than phase damping ; ( iii ) shorter depth implementation of a quantum function can achieve lower decoherence . simulations indicate 20\% improvement in the fidelity of a quantum adder when realized using lower depth topology . the insights developed in this paper can be exploited by the circuit designer to choose the right gates and logic implementation to optimize the system - level fidelity .
