we investigate a hybrid system consisting of an atomic ensemble trapped inside a dissipative optomechanical cavity assisted with the perturbative oscillator - qubit coupling . it is shown that such a hybrid system is very suitable for generating stationary squeezing of the mirror motion in the long - time limit under the unresolved sideband regime . based on the approaches of master equation and covariance matrix , we discuss the respective squeezing effects in detail and find that in both approaches , simplifying the system dynamics with adiabatic elimination of the highly dissipative cavity mode is very effective . in the approach of master equation , we find that the squeezing is a resulting effect of cooling process and is robust against the thermal fluctuations of the mechanical mode . while in the covariance matrix approach , we can obtain the analytical result of the steady - state mechanical position variance from the reduced dynamical equation approximately . finally , we compare the two different approaches and find that they are completely equivalent for the stationary dynamics . the scheme may be meaningful for the possible ultraprecise quantum measurement involved mechanical squeezing .
