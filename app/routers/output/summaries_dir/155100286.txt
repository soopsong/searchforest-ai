we present a quantum algorithm for ranking the nodes on a network in their order of importance . the algorithm is based on a directed discrete - time quantum walk , and works on all directed networks . this algorithm can theoretically be applied to the entire internet , and thus can function as a quantum pagerank algorithm . our analysis shows that the hierarchy of quantum rank matches well with the hierarchy of classical rank for directed tree network and for non - trivial cyclic networks , the hierarchy of quantum ranks do not exactly match to the hierarchy of the classical rank . this highlights the role of quantum interference and fluctuations in networks and the importance of using quantum algorithms to rank nodes in quantum networks . another application this algorithm can envision is to model the dynamics on networks mimicking the chemical complexes and rank active centers in order of reactivities . since discrete - time quantum walks are implementable on current quantum processing systems , this algorithm will also be of practical relevance in analysis of quantum architecture .
