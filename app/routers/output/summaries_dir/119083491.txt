the origin of nonclassicality in quantum mechanics ( qm ) has been investigated recently by a number of authors with a view to identifying axioms that would single out quantum mechanics as a special theory within a broader framework such as convex operational theories . in these studies , the axioms tend to be logically independent in the sense that no specific ordering of the axioms is implied . here , we identify a hierarchy of five nonclassical features that separate qm from a classical theory : ( q1 ) incompatibility and indeterminism ; ( q2 ) contextuality ; ( q3 ) entanglement ; ( q4 ) nonlocality and ( q5 ) indistinguishability of identical particles . such a hierarchy is n't obvious when viewed from within the quantum mechanical framework , but , from the perspective of generalized probability theories ( gpts ) , the later axioms can be regarded as further structure introduced on top of earlier axioms . relevant toy gpts are introduced at each layer when useful to illustrate the action of the nonclassical features associated with the particular layer .
