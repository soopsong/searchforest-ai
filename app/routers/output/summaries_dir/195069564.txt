we realize squeeze film pressure sensors using suspended , high mechanical quality silicon nitride membranes forming few - micron gap sandwiches . the effects of air pressure on the mechanical vibrations of the membranes are investigated in the range 10 ^ -3 - 50 mbar and the intermembrane coupling induced by the gas is discussed in light of a squeeze film coupled - oscillator model . the high responsivity ( several khz / mbar ) and the sub - pascal sensitivity of such simple pressure sensors are attractive for absolute and direct pressure measurements in rarefied air or high vacuum environments .
