we demonstrate that a ionising transition can be strongly coupled to a photonic resonance . the strong coupling manifests itself with the appearance of a narrow optically active resonance below the ionisation threshold . such a resonance is due to electrons transitioning into a novel bound state created by the collective coupling of the electron gas with the vacuum field of the photonic resonator . applying our theory to the case of bound - to - continuum transitions in microcavity - embedded doped quantum wells , we show how those strong - coupling features can be exploited as a novel knob to tune both optical and electronic properties of semiconductor heterostructures .
