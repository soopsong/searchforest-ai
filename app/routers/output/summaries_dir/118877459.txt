quantum optics with quantum gases represents a new field , where the quantum nature of both light and ultracold matter plays equally important role . only very recently this ultimate quantum limit of light - matter interaction became feasible experimentally . in traditional quantum optics , the cold atoms are considered classically , whereas , in quantum atom optics , the light is used as an essentially classical axillary tool . on the one hand , the quantization of optical trapping potentials can significantly modify many - body dynamics of atoms , which is well - known only for classical potentials . on the other hand , atomic fluctuations can modify the properties of the scattered light .
