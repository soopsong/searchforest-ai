we study squeezing of the spin uncertainties by quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement in non - polarized spin ensembles . unlike the case of polarized ensembles , the qnd measurements can be performed with negligible back - action , which allows , in principle , perfect spin squeezing as quantified by [ g. toth et al . , phys . rev . lett . 99 , 250405 ( 2007 ) ] . the generated spin states approach many - body singlet states , and contain a macroscopic number of entangled particles , even when individual spin is large . we introduce the gaussian treatment of unpolarized spin states and use it to estimate the achievable spin squeezing for realistic experimental parameters . our proposal might have applications for magnetometry with a high spatial resolution or quantum memories storing information in decoherence free subspaces .
