the paper is about methods of discrete fourier analysis in the context of weyl group symmetry . three families of class functions are defined on the maximal torus of each compact simply connected semisimple lie group $ g$. such functions can always be restricted without loss of information to a fundamental region $ \check f$ of the affine weyl group . the members of each family satisfy basic orthogonality relations when integrated over $ \check f$ ( continuous orthogonality ) . it is demonstrated that the functions also satisfy discrete orthogonality relations when summed up over a finite grid in $ \check f$ ( discrete orthogonality ) , arising as the set of points in $ \check f$ representing the conjugacy classes of elements of a finite abelian subgroup of the maximal torus $ \mathbb t$. the characters of the centre $ z$ of the lie group allow one to split functions $ f$ on $ \check f$ into a sum $ f = f_1+ ... +f_c$ , where $ c$ is the order of $ z$ , and where the component functions $ f_k$ decompose into the series of $ c$- , or $ s$- , or $ e$-functions from one congruence class only .
