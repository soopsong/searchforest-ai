in this chapter , we present some interesting properties of quantum walks on the line . we concentrate our attention in the emergence of invariance and provide some insights into the ultimate origin of the observed behavior . in the first part of the chapter , we review the building blocks of the quantum - mechanical version of the standard random walk in one dimension . the most distinctive difference between random and quantum walks is the replacement of the random coin in the former by the action of a unitary operator upon some internal property of the later . we provide explicit expressions for the solution to the problem when the most general form for the homogeneous unitary operator is considered , and we analyze several key features of the system as the presence of symmetries or stationary limits . after that , we analyze the consequences of letting the properties of the coin operator change from site to site , and from time step to time step . in spite of this lack of homogeneity , the probabilistic properties of the motion of the walker can remain unaltered if the coin variability is chosen adequately . finally , we show how this invariance can be connected to the gauge freedom of electromagnetism .
