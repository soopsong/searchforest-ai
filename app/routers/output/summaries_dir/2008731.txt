in this work , we present a comprehensive treatment of weighted random sampling ( wrs ) over data streams . more precisely , we examine two natural interpretations of the item weights , describe an existing algorithm for each case ( [ 2 , 4 ] ) , discuss sampling with and without replacement and show adaptations of the algorithms for several wrs problems and evolving data streams .
