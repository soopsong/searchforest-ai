in this paper we construct a new type of cavity array , in each cavity of which multiple two - level atoms interact with two independent photon modes . this system can be totally governed by a two - mode dicke - lattice model , which includes all of the counter - rotating terms and therefore works well in the ultrastrong coupling regime achieved in recent experiments . attributed to its special atom - photon coupling scheme , this model supports a global conserved excitation and a continuous $ u(1)$ symmetry , rather than the discrete $ z_{2}$ symmetry in the standard dicke - lattice model . this distinct change of symmetry via adding an extra photon mode strongly impacts the nature of photon localization / delocalization behavior . specifically , the atom - photon interaction features stable mott - lobe structures of photons and a second - order superfluid - mott - insulator phase transition , which share similarities with the jaynes - cummings - lattice and bose - hubbard models . more interestingly , the mott - lobe structures predicted here depend crucially on the atom number of each site . we also show that our model can be mapped into a continuous $ xx$ spin model . finally , we propose a scheme to implement the introduced cavity array in circuit quantum electrodynamics . this work broadens our understanding of strongly - correlated photons .
