solving mazes is not just a fun pastime . mazes are prototype models in graph theory , topology , robotics , traffic optimization , psychology , and in many other areas of science and technology . however , when maze complexity increases their solution becomes cumbersome and very time consuming . here , we show that a network of memristors - resistors with memory - can solve such a non - trivial problem quite easily . in particular , maze solving by the network of memristors occurs in a massively parallel fashion since all memristors in the network participate simultaneously in the calculation . the result of the calculation is then recorded into the memristors ' states , and can be used and/or recovered at a later time . furthermore , the network of memristors finds all possible solutions in multiple - solution mazes , and sorts out the solution paths according to their length . our results demonstrate not only the first application of memristive networks to the field of massively - parallel computing , but also a novel algorithm to solve mazes which could find applications in different research fields .
