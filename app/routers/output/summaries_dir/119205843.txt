the original two - way continuous - variable quantum - key - distribution ( cv qkd ) protocols [ s. pirandola , s. mancini , s. lloyd , and s. l. braunstein , nature physics 4 , 726 ( 2008 ) ] give the security against the collective attack on the condition of the tomography of the quantum channels . we propose a family of new two - way cv qkd protocols and prove their security against collective entangling cloner attacks without the tomography of the quantum channels . the simulation result indicates that the new protocols maintain the same advantage as the original two - way protocols whose tolerable excess noise surpasses that of the one - way cv - qkd protocol . we also show that all sub - protocols within the family have higher secret key rate and much longer transmission distance than the one - way cv - qkd protocol for the noisy channel .
