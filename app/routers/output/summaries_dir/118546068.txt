quantum gravitational effects may hold the key to some of the outstanding problems in theoretical physics . in this work we analyze the perturbative quantum effects on the boundary of a gravitational system and dirichlet boundary condtion imposed at the classical level . our analysis reveals that for a black hole solution there exists a clash between the quantum effects and dirichlet boundary condition : the solution of the one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) action no longer obeys the dirichlet boundary condition . the analysis also suggests that the violation of the dirichlet boundary condition should be tied with a certain mechanism of information storage on the boundary .
