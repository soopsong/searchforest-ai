it is well known that grover 's algorithm asymptotically transforms an equal superposition state into an eigenstate ( of a given basis ) . here , we demonstrate a verification algorithm based on weak measurement which can achieve the same purpose even if the qubit is not in an equal superposition state . the proposed algorithm highlights the distinguishability between any arbitrary single qubit superposition state and an eigenstate . we apply this algorithm to propose the scheme of a quantum locker , a protocol in which any legitimate party can verify his / her authenticity by using a newly developed quantum one - time password ( otp ) and retrieve the necessary message from the locker . we formally explicate the working of quantum locker in association with the quantum otp , which theoretically offers a much higher security against any adversary , as compared to any classical security device .
