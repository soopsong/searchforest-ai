in this work we investigate operation in the geiger mode of the new single photon avalanche photo diode ( spad ) sap500 manufactured by laser components . this spad is sensitive in the range 400 - 1000 nm and has a conventional reach - through structure which ensures good quantum efficiency at the long end of the spectrum . by use of passive and active quenching schemes we investigate detection efficiency , timing jitter , dark counts , afterpulsing , gain and other important parameters and compare them to the"standard"low noise spad c30902sh from perkin elmer . we conclude that sap500 offers better combination of detection efficiency , low noise and timing precision .
