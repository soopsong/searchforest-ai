stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) , driven with pulses of optimum shape and delay has the potential of reaching fidelities high enough to make it suitable for fault - tolerant quantum information processing . the optimum pulse shapes are obtained upon reduction of stirap to effective two - state systems . we use the dykhne - davis - pechukas ( ddp ) method to minimize nonadiabatic transitions and to maximize the fidelity of stirap . this results in a particular relation between the pulse shapes of the two fields driving the raman process . the ddp - optimized version of stirap maintains its robustness against variations in the pulse intensities and durations , the single - photon detuning and possible losses from the intermediate state .
