we study the quantum state of phonons propagating on top of a fluid of light coherently generated in a planar microcavity device by a quasi - resonant incident laser beam . in the steady - state under a monochromatic pump , because of the finite radiative lifetime of photons , a sizable incoherent population of low frequency phonons is predicted to appear . their mean occupation number differs from a planck distribution and is independent on the photon lifetime . when the photon fluid is subjected to a sudden change of its parameters , additional phonon pairs are created in the fluid with remarkable two - mode squeezing and entanglement properties . schemes to assess non - separability of the phonon state from measurements of the correlation functions of the emitted light are discussed .
