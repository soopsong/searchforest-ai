we present and utilize a simple formalism for the smooth creation of boundary conditions within relativistic quantum field theory . we consider a massless scalar field in $ ( 1 + 1)$-dimensional flat spacetime and imagine smoothly transitioning from there being no boundary condition to there being a two - sided dirichlet mirror . the act of doing this , expectantly , generates a flux of real quanta that emanates from the mirror as it is being created . we show that the local stress - energy tensor of the flux is finite only if an infrared cutoff is introduced , no matter how slowly the mirror is created , in agreement with the perturbative results of obadia and parentani . in the limit of instantaneous mirror creation the total energy injected into the field becomes ultraviolet divergent , but the response of an unruh - dewitt particle detector passing through the infinite burst of energy nevertheless remains finite . implications for vacuum entanglement extraction and for black hole firewalls are discussed .
