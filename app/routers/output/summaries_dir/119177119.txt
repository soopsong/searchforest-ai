in this paper , we consider a two - qubit system undergoing continuous - time measurements . in presence of multiple channels , we provide sufficient conditions on the continuous feedback control law ensuring almost sure exponential convergence to a predetermined bell state . this is obtained by applying stochastic tools , lyapunov methods and geometric control tools . with one channel , we establish asymptotic convergence towards a predetermined bell state . in both cases , we provide explicit expressions of feedback control laws satisfying the above - mentioned conditions . finally , we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through numerical simulations .
