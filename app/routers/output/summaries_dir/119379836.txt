an architecture for a quantum computer is presented in which spins associated with donors in silicon function as qubits . quantum operations on the spins are performed using a combination of voltages applied to gates adjacent to the spins and radio frequency applied magnetic fields resonant with spin transitions . initialization and measurement of electron spins is made by electrostatic probing of a two electron system , whose orbital configuration must depend on the spin states of the electrons because of the pauli principle . specific devices will be discussed which perform all the necessary operations for quantum computing , with an emphasis placed on the qualitative principles underlying their operation . the likely impediments to achieving large - scale quantum computation using this architecture will be addressed : the computer must operate at extremely low temperature , must be fabricated from devices built with near atomic precision , and will require extremely accurate gating operations in order to perform quantum logic . refinements to the computer architecture will be presented which could remedy each of these deficiencies . i will conclude by discussing a specific realization of the computer using si / sige heterostructures into which donors are deposited using a low energy focused ion beam .
