we show a perfect state transfer of an arbitrary unknown two - qubit state can be achieved via a discrete - time quantum walk with various settings of coin flippings , and extend this method to distribution of an arbitrary unknown multi - qubit entangled state between every pair of sites in the multi - dimensional network . furthermore , we study the routing of quantum information on this network in a quantum walk architecture , which can be used as quantum information processors to communicate between separated qubits .
