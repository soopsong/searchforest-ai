optimization of mutual synchronization between a pair of limit - cycle oscillators with weak symmetric coupling is considered in the framework of the phase reduction theory . by generalizing a previous study on the optimization of cross - diffusion coupling matrices between the oscillators , we consider optimization of mutual coupling signals to maximize the linear stability of the synchronized state , which are functionals of the past time sequences of the oscillator states . for the case of linear coupling , optimization of the delay time and linear filitering of coupling signals are considered . for the case of nonlinear coupling , general drive - response coupling is considered , and the optimal response and driving functions are derived . the theoretical results are exemplified by numerical simulations .
