we demonstrate that the framework of bounded quantum reference frames has application to building quantum - public - key cryptographic protocols and proving their security . thus , the framework we introduce can be seen as a public - key analogue of the framework of bartlett et al . ( phys . rev . a 70 , 032307 ) , where a private shared reference frame is shown to have cryptographic application . the protocol we present in this paper is an identification scheme , which , like a digital signature scheme , is a type of authentication scheme . we prove that our protocol is both reusable and secure under the honest - verifier assumption . thus , we also demonstrate that secure reusable quantum - public - key authentication is possible to some extent .
