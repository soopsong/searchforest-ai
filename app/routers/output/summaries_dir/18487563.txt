bohmian mechanics ( bm ) is a popular interpretation of quantum mechanics in which particles have real positions . the velocity of a point x in configuration space is defined as the standard probability current j(x ) divided by the probability density p(x ) . however , this ` ` standard ' ' j is in fact only one of infinitely many that transform correctly and satisfy \dot p + \del . j=0 . in this article i show that there is a unique j that can be determined experimentally as a weak value using techniques that would make sense to a classical physicist . moreover , this operationally defined j equals the standard j , so , assuming \dot x = j / p , the possible bohmian paths can also be determined experimentally from a large enough ensemble . furthermore , this approach to deriving bm singles out x as the hidden variable , because ( for example ) the operationally defined momentum current is in general incompatible with the evolution of the momentum distribution . finally i discuss how , in this setting , the usual quantum probabilities can be derived from a bayesian standpoint , via the principle of indifference .
