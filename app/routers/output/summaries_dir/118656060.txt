cat states of the microwave field stored in high - q resonators show great promise for robust encoding and manipulation of quantum information . here we propose an approach to efficiently prepare such cat states in a kerr - nonlinear resonator by the use of a two - photon drive . we show that this preparation is robust against single - photon loss . we moreover find that it is possible to remove undesirable phase evolution induced by a kerr nonlinearity using a two - photon drive of appropriate amplitude and phase . finally , we present a universal set of quantum logical gates that can be performed on the engineered eigenspace of the two - photon driven kerr - nonlinear resonator .
