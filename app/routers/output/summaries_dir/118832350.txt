we show that a local hamiltonian of spin-3/2 particles with only two - body nearest - neighbor affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki and exchange - type interactions has an unique ground state , which can be used to implement universal quantum computation merely with single - spin measurements . we prove that the hamiltonian is gapped , independent of the system size . our result provides a further step towards utilizing systems with condensed matter - type interactions for measurement - based quantum computation .
