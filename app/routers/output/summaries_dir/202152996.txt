experiments with superconducting circuits require careful calibration of the applied pulses and fields over a large frequency range . this remains an ongoing challenge as commercial semiconductor electronics are not able to probe signals arriving at the chip due to its cryogenic environment . here , we demonstrate how the on - chip amplitude and frequency of a microwave field can be inferred from the ac stark shifts of higher transmon levels . in our time - resolved measurements , we employ a simple quantum sensing protocol , i.e. ramsey fringes , allowing us to detect the amplitude of the systems transfer function over a range of several hundreds of mhz with an energy sensitivity on the order of $ 10^{-4}$. combined with similar measurements for the phase of the transfer function , our sensing method can facilitate the microwave calibration of high fidelity quantum gates necessary for working with superconducting quantum circuits . additionally , the potential to characterize arbitrary microwave fields promotes applications in related areas of research , such as quantum optics or hybrid microwave systems including photonic , mechanical or magnonic subsystems .
