in this work we study the heat transport in an xxz spin-1/2 heisenberg chain with homogeneous magnetic field , incoherently driven out of equilibrium by reservoirs at the boundaries . we focus on the effect of bulk dephasing ( energy - dissipative ) processes in different parameter regimes of the system . the non - equilibrium steady state of the chain is obtained by simulating its evolution under the corresponding lindblad master equation , using the time evolving block decimation method . in the absence of dephasing , the heat transport is ballistic for weak interactions , while being diffusive in the strongly - interacting regime , as evidenced by the heat - current scaling with the system size . when bulk dephasing takes place in the system , diffusive transport is induced in the weakly - interacting regime , with the heat current monotonically decreasing with the dephasing rate . in contrast , in the strongly - interacting regime , the heat current can be significantly enhanced by dephasing for systems of small size .
