regular arrays of electromagnetic resonators , in turn coupled coherently to individual quantum two - level systems , exhibit a quantum phase transition of polaritons from a superfluid phase to a mott - insulating phase . the critical behavior of such a jaynes - cummings lattice thus resembles the physics of the bose - hubbard model . we explore this analogy by elaborating on the mean - field theory of the phase transition , and by presenting several useful mappings which pinpoint both similarities and differences of the two models . we show that a field - theory approach can be applied to prove the existence of multicritical curves analogous to the multicritical points of the bose - hubbard model , and we provide analytical expressions for the position of these curves .
