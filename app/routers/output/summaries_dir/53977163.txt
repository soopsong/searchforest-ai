we consider quantum - classical hybrid machine learning in which large - scale input channels remain classical and small - scale working channels process quantum operations conditioned on classical input data . this does not require the conversion of classical ( big ) data to a quantum superposed state , in contrast to recently developed approaches for quantum machine learning . we performed optical experiments to illustrate a single - bit universal machine , which can be extended to a large - bit circuit for binary classification task . our experimental machine exhibits quantum learning speed - up of approximately 36 % , as compared to the fully classical machine . in addition , it features strong robustness against dephasing noise .
