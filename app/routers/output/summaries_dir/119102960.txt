in this paper , we study the quantum walk on the 2d penrose lattice , which is intermediate between periodic and disordered structure . quantum walk on penrose lattice is less efficient in transport comparing to the regular lattices . by calculating the final remaining probability on the initial nodes and estimating the low bound . our results show that the broken of translational symmetry induces both the localized states and degeneracy of eigenstates at $ e=0 $ , this two differences from regular lattices influence efficiency of quantum walk . also , we observe the transition from inefficient to efficient transport after introducing the near hopping terms , which suggests that we can adjust the"hopping strength"and achieve a"phase transition"progress .
