we examine an unruh - dewitt particle detector coupled to a scalar field in three - dimensional curved spacetime . we first obtain a regulator - free expression for the transition probability in an arbitrary hadamard state , working within first - order perturbation theory and assuming smooth switching , and we show that both the transition probability and the instantaneous transition rate remain well defined in the sharp switching limit . we then analyse a detector coupled to a massless conformally coupled field in the hartle - hawking vacua on the banados - teitelboim - zanelli black hole , under both transparent and reflective boundary conditions at the infinity . a selection of stationary and freely - falling detector trajectories are examined , including the co - rotating trajectories , for which the response is shown to be thermal . analytic results in a number of asymptotic regimes , including those of large and small mass , are complemented by numerical results in the interpolating regimes . the boundary condition at infinity is seen to have a significant effect on the transition rate .
