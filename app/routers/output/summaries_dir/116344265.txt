the concept of entanglement in systems where the particles are indistinguishable has been the subject of much recent interest and controversy . in this paper we study the notion of entanglement of particles introduced by wiseman and vaccaro [ phys . rev . lett . 91 , 097902 ( 2003 ) ] in several specific physical systems , including some that occur in condensed matter physics . the entanglement of particles is relevant when the identical particles are itinerant and so not distinguished by their position as in spin models . we show that entanglement of particles can behave differently to other approaches that have been used previously , such as entanglement of modes ( occupation - number entanglement ) and the entanglement in the two - spin reduced density matrix . we argue that the entanglement of particles is what could actually be measured in most experimental scenarios and thus its physical significance is clear . this suggests entanglement of particles may be useful in connecting theoretical and experimental studies of entanglement in condensed matter systems .
