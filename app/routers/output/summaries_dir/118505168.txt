nonclassical states of macroscopic objects are promising for ultrasensitive metrology as well as testing quantum mechanics . in this work , we investigate dissipative mechanical quantum state engineering in an optically levitated nanodiamond . first , we study single - mode mechanical squeezed states by magnetically coupling the mechanical motion to a dressed three - level system provided by a nitrogen - vacancy center in the nanoparticle . quantum coherence between the dressed levels is created via microwave fields to induce a two - phonon transition , which results in mechanical squeezing . remarkably , we find that in ultrahigh vacuum quantum squeezing is achievable at room temperature with feedback cooling . for moderate vacuum , quantum squeezing is possible with cryogenic temperature . second , we present a setup for two mechanical modes coupled to the dressed three levels , which results in two - mode squeezing analogous to the mechanism of the single - mode case . in contrast to previous works , our study provides a deterministic method for engineering macroscopic squeezed states without the requirement for a cavity .
