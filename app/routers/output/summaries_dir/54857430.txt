virtually all interactions that are relevant for atomic and condensed matter physics are mediated by quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field vacuum . consequently , controlling the vacuum fluctuations can be used to engineer the strength and the range of interactions . recent experiments have used this premise to demonstrate novel quantum phases or entangling gates by embedding electric dipoles in photonic cavities or waveguides , which modify the electromagnetic fluctuations . here , we show theoretically that the enhanced fluctuations in the anti - squeezed quadrature of a squeezed vacuum state allows for engineering interactions between electric dipoles without the need for a photonic structure . thus , the strength and range of the interactions can be engineered in a time - dependent way by changing the spatial profile of the squeezed vacuum in a travelling - wave geometry , which also allows the implementation of chiral dissipative interactions . using experimentally realized squeezing parameters and including realistic losses , we predict single atom cooperativities $ c$ of up to 10 for the squeezed vacuum enhanced interactions .
