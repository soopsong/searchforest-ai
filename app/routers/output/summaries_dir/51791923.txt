we investigate the quantum optical torque on an atom interacting with an inhomogeneous electromagnetic environment described by the most general linear constitutive relations . the atom is modeled as a two - level system prepared in an arbitrary initial energy state . using the heisenberg equation of motion ( hem ) and under the markov approximation , we show that the optical torque has a resonant and non - resonant part , associated respectively with a spontaneous - emission process and casimir - type interactions with the quantum vacuum , which can both be written explicitly in terms of the system green function . our formulation is valid for any inhomogeneous , dissipative , dispersive , nonreciprocal , and bianisotropic structure . we apply this general theory to a scenario in which the atom interacts with a photonic topological material with broken time - reversal symmetry . in this case , the main decay channel of the atom energy is represented by the unidirectional surface waves launched on the topological material - vacuum interface . to provide relevant physical insight into the role of these unidirectional surface waves in the emergence of non - trivial optical torque , we derive closed - form expressions for the induced torque under the quasi - static approximation . finally , we investigate the equilibrium states of the atom polarization , along which the atom spontaneously tends to align due to the action of the torque . our theoretical predictions may be experimentally tested with cold rydberg atoms and superconducting qubits near a photonic topological material . we believe that our general theory may find broad application in the context of nano - mechanical and bio - mechanical systems .
