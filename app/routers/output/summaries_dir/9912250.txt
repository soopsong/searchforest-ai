we propose an implementation of a quantum walk on a circle on an optomechanical system by encoding the walker on the phase space of a radiation field and the coin on a two - level state of a mechanical resonator . the dynamics of the system is obtained by applying suzuki - trotter decomposition . we numerically show that the system displays typical behaviors of quantum walks , namely , the probability distribution evolves ballistically and the standard deviation of the phase distribution is linearly proportional to the number of steps . we also analyze the effects of decoherence by using the phase damping channel on the coin space , showing the possibility to implement the quantum walk with present day technology .
