spectral decomposition of dynamical systems is a popular methodology to investigate the fundamental qualitative and quantitative properties of these systems and their solutions . in this chapter , we consider a class of nonlinear cooperative protocols , which consist of multiple agents that are coupled together via an undirected state - dependent graph . we develop a representation of the system solution by decomposing the nonlinear system utilizing ideas from the koopman operator theory and its spectral analysis . we use recent results on the extensions of the well - known hartman theorem for hyperbolic systems to establish a connection between the original nonlinear dynamics and the linearized dynamics in terms of koopman spectral properties . the expected value of the output energy of the nonlinear protocol , which is related to the notions of coherence and robustness in dynamical networks , is evaluated and characterized in terms of koopman eigenvalues , eigenfunctions , and modes . spectral representation of the performance measure enables us to develop algorithmic methods to assess the performance of this class of nonlinear dynamical networks as a function of their graph topology . finally , we propose a scalable computational method for approximation of the components of the koopman mode decomposition , which is necessary to evaluate the systemic performance measure of the nonlinear dynamic network .
