we introduce the concept of cryptographic reduction , in analogy with a similar concept in computational complexity theory . in this framework , class $ a$ of crypto - protocols reduces to protocol class $ b$ in a scenario $ x$ , if for every instance $ a$ of $ a$ , there is an instance $ b$ of $ b$ and a secure transformation $ x$ that reproduces $ a$ given $ b$ , such that the security of $ b$ guarantees the security of $ a$. here we employ this reductive framework to study the relationship between security in quantum key distribution ( qkd ) and quantum secure direct communication ( qsdc ) . we show that replacing the streaming of independent qubits in a qkd scheme by block encoding and transmission ( permuting the order of particles block by block ) of qubits , we can construct a qsdc scheme . this forms the basis for the \textit{block reduction } from a qsdc class of protocols to a qkd class of protocols , whereby if the latter is secure , then so is the former . conversely , given a secure qsdc protocol , we can of course construct a secure qkd scheme by transmitting a random key as the direct message . then the qkd class of protocols is secure , assuming the security of the qsdc class which it is built from . we refer to this method of deduction of security for this class of qkd protocols , as \textit{key reduction } . finally , we propose an orthogonal - state - based deterministic key distribution ( kd ) protocol which is secure in some local post - quantum theories . its security arises neither from geographic splitting of a code state nor from heisenberg uncertainty , but from post - measurement disturbance .
