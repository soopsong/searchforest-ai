we develop an experimental scheme based on a continuous - wave ( cw ) laser for generating arbitrary superpositions of photon number states . in this experiment , we successfully generate superposition states of zero to three photons , namely advanced versions of superpositions of two and three coherent states . they are fully compatible with developed quantum teleportation and measurement - based quantum operations with cw lasers . due to achieved high detection efficiency , we observe , without any loss correction , multiple areas of negativity of wigner function , which confirm strongly nonclassical nature of the generated states .
