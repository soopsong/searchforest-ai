a microscopic approach to macroeconomic features is intended . a model for macroeconomic behavior under heterogeneous spatial economic conditions is reviewed . a birth – death lattice gas model taking into account the influence of an economic environment on the fitness and concentration evolution of economic entities is numerically and analytically examined . the reaction – diffusion model can also be mapped onto a high - order logistic map . the role of the selection pressure along various dynamics with entity diffusion on a square symmetry lattice has been studied by monte – carlo simulation . the model leads to a sort of phase transition for the fitness gap as a function of the selection pressure and to cycles . the control parameter is a ( scalar ) “ business plan ” . the business plan(s ) allows for spin - offs or merging and enterprise survival evolution law(s ) , whence bifurcations , cycles and chaotic behavior .
