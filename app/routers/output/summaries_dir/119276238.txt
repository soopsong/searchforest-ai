quantum systems are notoriously difficult to simulate with classical means . recently , the idea of using another quantum system - which is experimentally more controllable - as a simulator for the original problem has gained significant momentum . amongst the experimental platforms studied as quantum simulators , superconducting qubits are one of the most promising , due to relative straightforward scalability , easy design , and integration with standard electronics . here i review the recent state - of - the art in the field and the prospects for simulating systems ranging from relativistic quantum fields to quantum many - body systems .
