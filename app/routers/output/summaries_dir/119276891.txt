the case for the utility of kruskal - szekeres coordinates in classroom made by augousti et al . in this journal ( eur . j. phys . 33:1 - -11 , 2012 ) is strengthened by extending their discussion beyond the event horizon of the black hole . observations made by two adventurers following one another into a schwarzschild black hole are examined in terms of these nonsingular coordinates . two scenarios are considered , the first corresponding to one observer following the other closely , the second to a significant distance between the two of them , precluding the existence of a common inertial system . in particular , the concepts of distance and temporal separation near the horizon and the redshift of the first infaller 's image as seen by the second are investigated . the results show that the notion of"touching ghosts"does not correspond to the local physics of two observers falling into a black hole . the story line is interesting enough and the mathematical details are sufficiently simple to use the example in a general relativity course , even at the undergraduate level .
