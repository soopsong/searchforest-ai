we study the time evolution of classical and quantum correlations for hybrid qubit - qutrit systems in independent and common classical dephasing environments . our discussion involves a comparative analysis of the markovian dynamics of negativity , quantum discord , geometric measure of quantum discord and classical correlation . for the case of independent environments , we have demonstrated the phenomenon of sudden transition between classical and quantum decoherence for qubit - qutrit states . in the common environment case , we have shown that dynamics of quantum and geometric discords might be completely independent of each other for a certain time interval , although they tend to be eventually in accord .
