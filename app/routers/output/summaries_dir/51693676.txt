non - gaussian continuous - variable quantum states represent a pivotal resource in many quantum information protocols . production of such states can occur through photonic subtraction process either at the transmitter side prior to sending a state through the channel , or at the receiver side on receipt of a state that has traversed the channel . in the context of quantum protocols implemented over communication channels to and from low - earth - orbit ( leo ) satellites it is unclear what photonic subtraction set - up will provide for the best performance . in this work we show that for a popular version of continuous - variable quantum key distribution between terrestrial stations and leo satellites , photon subtraction at the transmitter side is the preferred set - up . such a result is opposite to that found for fiber - based implementations . our results have implications for all future space - based missions that seek to take advantage of the opportunities offered by non - gaussian quantum states .
