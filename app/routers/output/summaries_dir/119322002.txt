since its introduction by hastings in [ 10 ] , the technique of quasi - adiabatic continuation has become a central tool in the discussion and classification of ground state phases . it connects the ground states of self - adjoint hamiltonians in the same phase by a unitary quasi - local transformation . this paper takes a step towards extending this result to non- self adjoint perturbations , though , for technical reason , we restrict ourselves here to weak perturbations of non - interacting spins . the extension to non - self adjoint perturbation is important for potential applications to glauber dynamics ( and its quantum analogues ) . in contrast to the standard quasi - adiabatic transformation , the transformation constructed here is exponentially local . our scheme is inspired by kam theory , with frustration - free operators playing the role of integrable hamiltonians .
