obtaining the exciton dynamics of large photosynthetic complexes by using mixed quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics ( qm / mm ) is computationally demanding . we propose a machine learning technique , multi - layer perceptrons , as a tool to reduce the time required to compute excited state energies . with this approach we predict time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) excited state energies of bacteriochlorophylls in the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex . additionally we compute spectral densities and exciton populations from the predictions . different methods to determine multi - layer perceptron training sets are introduced , leading to several initial data selections . in addition , we compute spectral densities and exciton populations . once multi - layer perceptrons are trained , predicting excited state energies was found to be significantly faster than the corresponding qm / mm calculations . we showed that multi - layer perceptrons can successfully reproduce the energies of qm / mm calculations to a high degree of accuracy with prediction errors contained within 0.01 ev ( 0.5 % ) . spectral densities and exciton dynamics are also in agreement with the tddft results . the acceleration and accurate prediction of dynamics strongly encourage the combination of machine learning techniques with ab - initio methods .
