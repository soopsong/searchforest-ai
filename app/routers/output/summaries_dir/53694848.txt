artificial neural networks are the heart of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence protocols . historically , the simplest implementation of an artificial neuron traces back to the classical rosenblatt 's ` perceptron ' , but its long term practical applications may be hindered by the fast scaling up of computational complexity , especially relevant for the training of multilayered perceptron networks . here we introduce a quantum information - based algorithm implementing the quantum computer version of a perceptron , which shows exponential advantage in encoding resources over alternative realizations . we experimentally test a few qubits version of this model on an actual small - scale quantum processor , which gives remarkably good answers against the expected results . we show that this quantum model of a perceptron can be used as an elementary nonlinear classifier of simple patterns , as a first step towards practical training of artificial quantum neural networks to be efficiently implemented on near - term quantum processing hardware .
