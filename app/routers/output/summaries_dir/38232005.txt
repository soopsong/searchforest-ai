quantum optics experiments frequently involve interfering single photons and coherent states . in the case of multi - photon experiments this requires that all photons are frequency degenerate . we report a simple and practical approach to generate coherent states that can be readily tuned to any wavelength required , for example by non - degenerate photon pair creation . we demonstrate this by performing a two - photon ( hong - ou - mandel ) interference experiment between a coherent state and a pure heralded single photon source . no spectral filtering is required on either source , the coherent state constrained by the pump and seed lasers and the heralded photon exploits non - local filtering . we expect that such an approach can find a wide range of applications in photonic based quantum information science .
