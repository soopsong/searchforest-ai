quantum coherence as an important quantum resource plays a key role in quantum theory . in this paper , using entropy - based measures , we investigate the relations between quantum correlated coherence , which is the coherence between subsystems [ k. c. tan , h. kwon , c. y. park , and h. jeong , phys . rev . a 94 , 022329 ( 2016 ) ] , and two main kinds of quantum correlations as defined by quantum discord as well as quantum entanglement . in particular , we show that quantum discord and quantum entanglement can be well characterized by quantum correlated coherence . moreover , we prove that the entanglement measure formulated by quantum correlated coherence is lower and upper bounded by the relative entropy of entanglement and the entanglement of formation , respectively , and equal to the relative entropy of entanglement for maximally correlated states .
