we improve the number of t gates needed to perform an n - bit adder from 8n + o(1 ) to 4n + o(1 ) . we do so via a"temporary logical - and"construction which uses four t gates to store the logical - and of two qubits into an ancilla and zero t gates to later erase the ancilla . this construction is equivalent to one by jones , except that our framing makes it clear that the technique is far more widely applicable than previously realized . temporary logical - ands can be applied to integer arithmetic , modular arithmetic , rotation synthesis , the quantum fourier transform , shor 's algorithm , grover oracles , and many other circuits . because t gates dominate the cost of quantum computation based on the surface code , and temporary logical - ands are widely applicable , this represents a significant reduction in projected costs of quantum computation . in addition to our n - bit adder , we present an n - bit controlled adder circuit with t - count of 8n + o(1 ) , a temporary adder that can be computed for the same cost as the normal adder but whose result can be kept until it is later uncomputed without using t gates , and discuss some other constructions whose t - count is improved by the temporary logical - and .
