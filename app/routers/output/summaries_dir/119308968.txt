the entanglement spectrum , i.e. , the full distribution of schmidt eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix , contains more information than the conventional entanglement entropy and has been studied recently in several many - particle systems . we compute the disorder - averaged entanglement spectrum , in the form of the disorder - averaged moments of the reduced density matrix , for a contiguous block of many spins at the random - singlet quantum critical point in one dimension . the result compares well in the scaling limit with numerical studies on the random xx model and is also expected to describe the ( interacting ) random heisenberg model . our numerical studies on the xx case reveal that the dependence of the entanglement entropy and spectrum on the geometry of the hilbert space partition is quite different than for conformally invariant critical points .
