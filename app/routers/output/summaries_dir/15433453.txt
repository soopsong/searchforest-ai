the wkb and instanton answers for the tunnel splitting of the ground state in a symmetric double well potential are both reduced to an expression involving only the functionals of the potential , without the need for solving any auxilliary problems . this formula is applied to simple model problems . the prefactor for the splitting in the text book by landau and lifshitz is amended so as to apply to the ground and low lying excited states .
