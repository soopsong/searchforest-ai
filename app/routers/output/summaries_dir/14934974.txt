in this paper , we present a collection of results on the observability of quantum mechanical systems , in the case the output is the result of a discrete nonselective measurement . nt . by defining an effective observable , we extend previous results , on the lie algebraic characterization of observable systems , to general measurements . further results include the characterization of a ` best probe ' ( i.e. a minimally disturbing probe ) in indirect measurement and a study of the relation between disturbance and observability in this case . we also discuss how the observability properties of a quantum system relate to the problem of state reconstruction . extensions of the formalism to the case of selective measurements are also given .
