prospects for reaching persistent entanglement between two spatially separated atomic bose - einstein condensates are outlined . the system set - up comprises of two condensates loaded in an optical lattice , which , in return , is confined within a high - q optical resonator . the system is driven by an external laser that illuminates the atoms such that photons can scatter into the cavity . in the superradiant phase a cavity field is established and we show that the emerging cavity mediated interactions between the two condensates is capable of entangling them despite photon losses . this macroscopic atomic entanglement is sustained throughout the time - evolution apart from occasions of sudden deaths / births . using an auxiliary photon mode and coupling it to a collective quadrature of the two condensates we demonstrate that the auxiliary mode 's squeezing is proportional to the atomic entanglement and as such it can serve as a probe field of the macroscopic entanglement .
