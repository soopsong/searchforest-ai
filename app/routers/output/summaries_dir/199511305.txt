it is now experimentally possible to entangle thousands of qubits , and efficiently measure each qubit in parallel in a distinct basis . to fully characterize an unknown entangled state of $ n$ qubits , one requires an exponential number of measurements in $ n$ , which is experimentally unfeasible even for modest system sizes . by leveraging ( i ) that single - qubit measurements can be made in parallel , and ( ii ) the theory of perfect hash families , we show that all $ k$-qubit reduced density matrices of an $ n$ qubit state can be determined with at most $ e^{\mathcal{o}(k ) } \log^2(n)$ rounds of parallel measurements . we provide concrete measurement protocols which realize this bound . as an example , we argue that with current experiments , the entanglement between every pair of qubits in a system of 1000 qubits could be measured and completely characterized in a few days . this corresponds to completely characterizing entanglement of nearly half a million pairs of qubits .
