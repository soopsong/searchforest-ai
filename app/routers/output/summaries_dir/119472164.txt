we characterize the class of all physical operations that transform gaussian states to gaussian states . we show that this class coincides with that of all operations which can be performed on gaussian states using linear optical elements and homodyne measurements . for bipartite systems we characterize the processes which can be implemented by local operations and classical communication , as well as those that can be implemented using positive partial transpose preserving maps . as an application , we show that gaussian states can not be distilled by local gaussian operations and classical communication . we also define and characterize positive ( but not completely positive ) gaussian maps .
