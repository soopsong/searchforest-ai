a mixed quantum state shared between two parties is said to be distillable if , by means of a protocol involving only local quantum operations and classical communication , the two parties can transform some number of copies of that state into a single shared pair of qubits having high fidelity with a maximally entangled state state . in this paper it is proved that there exist states that are distillable , but for which an arbitrarily large number of copies is required before any distillation procedure can produce a shared pair of qubits with even a small amount of entanglement . specifically , for every positive integer n there exists a state that is distillable , but given n or fewer copies of that state every distillation procedure outputting a single shared pair of qubits will output those qubits in a separable state . essentially all previous examples of states proved to be distillable were such that some distillation procedure could output an entangled pair of qubits given a single copy of the state in question .
