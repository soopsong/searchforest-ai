probing the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of quantum matter has gained renewed interest owing to immense experimental progress in artifcial quantum systems . dynamical quantum measures such as the growth of entanglement entropy ( ee ) and out - of - time ordered correlators ( otocs ) have been shown , theoretically , to provide great insight by exposing subtle quantum features invisible to traditional measures such as mass transport . however , measuring them in experiments requires either identical copies of the system , an ancilla qubit coupled to the whole system , or many measurements on a single copy , thereby making scalability extremely complex and hence , severely limiting their potential . here , we introduce an alternate quantity $ -$ the out - of - time - ordered measurement ( otom ) $ -$ which involves measuring a single observable on a single copy of the system , while retaining the distinctive features of the otocs . we show , theoretically , that otoms are closely related to otocs in a doubled system with the same quantum statistical properties as the original system . using exact diagonalization , we numerically simulate classical mass transport , as well as quantum dynamics through computations of the otoc , the otom , and the ee in quantum spin chain models in various interesting regimes ( including chaotic and many - body localized systems ) . our results demonstrate that an otom can successfully reveal subtle aspects of quantum dynamics hidden to classical measures , and crucially , provide experimental access to them .
