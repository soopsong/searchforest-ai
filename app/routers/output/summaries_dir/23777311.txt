the fundamentals of a quantum heat engine are derived from first principles . the study is based on the equation of motion of a minimum set of operators which is then used to define the state of the system . the relation between the quantum framework and thermodynamical observables is examined . a four stroke heat engine model with a coupled two - level - system as a working fluid is used to explore the fundamental relations . in the model used , the internal hamiltonian does not commute with the external control field which defines the two adiabatic branches . heat is transferred to the working fluid by coupling to hot and cold reservoirs under constant field values . explicit quantum equation of motion for the relevant observables are derived on all branches . the dynamics on the heat transfer constant field branches is solved in closed form . on the adiabats , a general numerical solution is used and compared with a particular analytic solution . these solutions are combined to construct the cycle of operation . the engine is then analyzed in terms of frequency - entropy and entropy - temperature graphs . the irreversible nature of the engine is the result of finite heat transfer rates and friction - like behavior due to noncommutability of the internal and external hamiltonian .
