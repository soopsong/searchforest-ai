we present two efficient schemes for the deterministic generation and the complete nondestructive analysis of hyperentangled bell states in both the polarization and spatial - mode degrees of freedom ( dofs ) of two - photon systems , assisted by the nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers in diamonds coupled to microtoroidal resonators as a result of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . with the input - output process of photons , two - photon polarization - spatial hyperentangled bell states can be generated in a deterministic way and their complete nondestructive analysis can be achieved . these schemes can be generalized to generate and analyze hyperentangled greenberger - horne - zeilinger states of multi - photon systems as well . compared with previous works , these two schemes relax the difficulty of their implementation in experiment as it is not difficult to obtain the $ \pi$ phase shift in single - sided nv - cavity systems . moreover , our schemes do not require that the transmission for the uncoupled cavity is balanceable with the reflectance for the coupled cavity . our calculations show that these schemes can reach a high fidelity and efficiency with current technology , which may be a benefit to long - distance high - capacity quantum communication with two dofs of photon systems .
