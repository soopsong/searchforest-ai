many synthesis approaches for reversible and quantum logic have been proposed so far . however , most of them generate circuits with respect to simple metrics , i.e. gate count or quantum cost . on the other hand , to physically realize reversible and quantum hardware , additional constraints exist . in this paper , we describe cost metrics beyond gate count and quantum cost that should be considered while synthesizing reversible and quantum logic for the respective target technologies . we show that the evaluation of a synthesis approach may differ if additional costs are applied . in addition , a new cost metric , namely nearest neighbor cost ( nnc ) which is imposed by realistic physical quantum architectures , is considered in detail . we discuss how existing synthesis flows can be extended to generate optimal circuits with respect to nnc while still keeping the quantum cost small .
