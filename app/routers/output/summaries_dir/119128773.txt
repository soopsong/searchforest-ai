the behavior of an electron in an external uniform electromagnetic background coupled to a harmonic potential , with noncommuting space coordinates , is considered in this work . the thermodynamics of the system is studied . matrix vector coherent states ( mvcs ) as well as quaternionic vector coherent states ( qvcs ) , satisfying required properties , are also constructed and discussed .
