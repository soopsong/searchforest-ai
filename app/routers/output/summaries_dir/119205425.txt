in typical discrete - time quantum walk algorithms , one measures the position of the walker while ignoring its internal spin / coin state . rather than neglecting the information in this internal state , we show that additionally measuring it doubles the success probability of many quantum spatial search algorithms . for example , this allows grover 's unstructured search problem to be solved with certainty , rather than with probability 1/2 if only the walker 's position is measured , so the additional measurement yields a search algorithm that is twice as fast as without it , on average . thus the internal state of discrete - time quantum walks holds valuable information that can be utilized to improve algorithms . furthermore , we determine conditions for which spatial search problems on regular graphs are amenable to this doubling of the success probability , and this involves diagrammatically analyzing search using degenerate perturbation theory and deriving a useful formula for how the quantum walk acts in its reduced subspace .
