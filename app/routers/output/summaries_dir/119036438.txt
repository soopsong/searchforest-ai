we study the ground - state entanglement hamiltonian for an interval of $ n$ sites in a free - fermion chain with arbitrary filling . by relating it to a commuting operator , we find explicit expressions for its matrix elements in the large-$n$ limit . the results agree with numerical calculations and show that deviations from the conformal prediction persist even for large systems .
