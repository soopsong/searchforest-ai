we study hybrid atom - molecule quantum walks in one - dimensional optical lattices with two interacting bosonic atoms which may be converted into a molecule . the hybrid atom - molecule energy bands include a continuum band and two isolated bands , which respectively correspond to scattering states and dressed bound states ( dbs 's ) . because of the atom - molecule coupling , the dbs 's may appear even in the absence of atom - atom interaction . from an initial state of two atoms occupying the same site , in addition to independent quantum walks which correspond to scattering states , correlated quantum walks appear as a signature of dbs 's . even if the atom - atom interaction and the atom - molecule coupling are much stronger than the tunneling strengths , independent quantum walks may still appear under certain resonant conditions . the correlated quantum walks show two light - cones with different propagation velocities , which can be analytically explained by the effective tunneling strengths of the two different dbs 's . furthermore , the effective nearest - neighbor tunneling of dbs 's can be suppressed to zero , which can be explained by the destructive interference between the atomic pair and the molecule .
