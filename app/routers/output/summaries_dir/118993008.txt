since unconditionally secure quantum two - party computations are known to be impossible , most existing quantum private comparison ( qpc ) protocols adopted a third party . recently , we proposed a qpc protocol which involves two parties only , and showed that although it is not unconditionally secure , it only leaks an extremely small amount of information to the other party . here we further propose the device - independent version of the protocol , so that it can be more convenient and dependable in practical applications .
