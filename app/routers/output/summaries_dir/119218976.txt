we study the time evolution of continuous - time quantum walks on randomly changing graphs . at certain moments edges of the graph appear or disappear with a given probability . we focus on the case when the time interval between subsequent changes of the graph tends to zero . we derive explicit formulae for the general evolution in this limit . we find that the percolation in this limit causes an effective time rescaling . independently of the graph and the initial state of the walk , the time is rescaled by the probability of keeping and edge . both the individual trajectories for a single system and average properties with a superoperator formalism are discussed . we give an analytical proof for our theorem and we also present results from numerical simulations of the phenomena for different graphs .
