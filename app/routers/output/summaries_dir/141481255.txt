quantum measurement is a fundamental cornerstone of experimental quantum computations . the main issues in current quantum measurement strategies are the high number of measurement rounds to determine a global optimal measurement output and the low success probability of finding a global optimal measurement output . each measurement round requires preparing the quantum system and applying quantum operations and measurements with high - precision control in the physical layer . these issues result in extremely high - cost measurements with a low probability of success at the end of the measurement rounds . here , we define a novel measurement for quantum computations called dense quantum measurement . the dense measurement strategy aims at fixing the main drawbacks of standard quantum measurements by achieving a significant reduction in the number of necessary measurement rounds and by radically improving the success probabilities of finding global optimal outputs . we provide application scenarios for quantum circuits with arbitrary unitary sequences , and prove that dense measurement theory provides an experimentally implementable solution for gate - model quantum computer architectures .
