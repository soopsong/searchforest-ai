the efficiency of optical trapping of ultracold atoms depend on the atomic dynamic dipole polarizability governing the atom - field interaction . in this article , we have calculated the real and imaginary parts of the dynamic dipole polarizability of dysprosium in the ground and first excited level . due to the high electronic angular momentum of those two states , the polarizabilities possess scalar , vector and tensor contributions that we have computed , on a wide range of trapping wavelengths , using the sum - over - state formula . using the same formalism , we have also calculated the $ c_6 $ coefficients characterizing the van der waals interaction between two dysprosium atoms in the two lowest levels . we have computed the energies of excited states and the transition probabilities appearing in the sums , using a combination of \textit{ab initio } and least - square - fitting techniques provided by the cowan codes and extended in our group . regarding the real part of the polarizability , for field frequencies far from atomic resonances , the vector and tensor contributions are two - order - of - magnitude smaller than the scalar contribution , whereas for the imaginary part , the vector and tensor contributions represent a noticeable fraction of the scalar contribution . this offers the possibility to control the decoherence and trap losses due to spontaneous emission .
