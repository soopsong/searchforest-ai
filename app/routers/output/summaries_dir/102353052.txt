in this work , we consider the phase - space picture of quantum mechanics . we then introduce non - negative wigner - like ( operational ) distributions \widetilde{\mathcal w}_{rho;alpha}(x , p ) corresponding to the density operator \hat{rho } and being proportional to { w_{rho^(alpha/2)}(x , p)}^2 , where w_{rho}(x , p ) denotes the usual wigner function . in doing so , we utilize the formal symmetry between the purity measure tr(rho^2 ) and its wigner representation ( 2 pi hbar ) \int dx dp { w_{rho}(x , p)}^2 and then consider , as a generalization , such symmetry between the fractional moment tr(\hat{rho}^{alpha } ) and its wigner representation ( 2 pi hbar ) \int dx dp { w_{rho^{alpha/2}}(x , p)}^2 . next , we create a framework that enables explicit evaluation of the renyi - wigner entropies for the classical - like distributions \widetilde{\mathcal w}_{rho;alpha}(x , p ) . consequently , a better understanding of some non - gaussian features of a given state rho will be given , by comparison with the gaussian state rho_g defined in terms of its wigner function w_{rho_g}(x , p ) and essentially determined by its purity measure t(rho_g)^2 alone . to illustrate the validity of our framework , we evaluate the distributions \widetilde{\mathcal w}_{beta;alpha}(x , p ) corresponding to the ( non - gaussian ) thermal state rho_{\beta } of a single particle confined by a one - dimensional infinite potential well with either the dirichlet or neumann boundary condition and then analyze the resulting renyi entropies . our phase - space approach will also contribute to a deeper understanding of non - gaussian states and their properties either in the semiclassical limit ( hbar \to 0 ) or in the high - temperature limit ( beta \to 0 ) , as well as enabling us to systematically discuss the quantal - classical second law of thermodynamics on the single footing .
