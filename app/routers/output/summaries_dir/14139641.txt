the central issue in this article is to transmit a quantum state in such a way that after some decoherence occurs , most of the information can be restored by a suitable decoding operation . for this purpose , we incorporate redundancy by mapping a given initial quantum state to a messenger state on a larger - dimensional hilbert space via a $ c^*$-algebra embedding . our noise model for the transmission is a phase damping channel which admits a noiseless or decoherence - free subspace or subsystem . more precisely , the transmission channel is obtained from convex combinations of a set of lowest rank yes / no measurements that leave a component of the messenger state unchanged . the objective of our encoding is to distribute quantum information optimally across the noise - susceptible component of the transmission when the noiseless component is not large enough to contain all the quantum information to be transmitted . we derive simple geometric conditions for optimal encoding and construct examples .
