we investigate single photon scattering properties in one - dimensional waveguide coupled to quantum emitter 's chain with dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) . the photon transport is extremely sensitive to the location of the evanescently coupled emitters . the analytical expressions of reflection and transmission amplitudes for the chain containing two emitters with ddi are deduced by using real - space hamiltonian . two cases , where the two emitters symmetrically and asymmetrically couple to the waveguide , are discussed in detail . it shows that the reflection and transmission typical spectra split into two peaks due to the ddi . the fano minimum in the spectra can also be used to estimate the strength of the ddi . furthermore , the ddi makes spectra strongly asymmetric and create a transmission window in the region where there was zero transmission . the scattering spectra for the chain consisting of multi - emitters are also given . our key finding is that ddi can broaden the frequency band width for high reflection when the chain consists of many emitters .
