in this paper we will present a quantization method for spp ( surface plasmon polariton ) based on green 's tensor method , which is applied usually for quantization of em - field in various dielectric media . this method will be applied for a semi - infinite structure , which contains metal and dielectric regions with one interface . moreover , by introducing the quantized spp , we will investigate the spp propagation in the attenuating and amplifying systems . we will also consider two modes of spp , i.e. , coherent and squeezed states , and finally compare the propagation of these modes in the amplifying media .
