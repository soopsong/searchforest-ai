the assumption that physical systems relax to a stationary state in the long - time limit underpins statistical physics and much of our intuitive understanding of scientific phenomena . for isolated systems this follows from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis . when an environment is present the expectation is that all of phase space is explored , eventually leading to stationarity . notable exceptions are decoherence - free subspaces that have important implications for quantum technologies . these have been studied for systems with a few degrees of freedom only . here we identify simple and generic conditions for dissipation to prevent a quantum many - body system from ever reaching a stationary state . we go beyond dissipative quantum state engineering approaches towards controllable long - time non - stationary dynamics typically associated with macroscopic complex systems . this coherent and oscillatory evolution constitutes a dissipative version of a quantum time - crystal . we discuss the possibility of engineering such complex dynamics with fermionic ultracold atoms in optical lattices .
