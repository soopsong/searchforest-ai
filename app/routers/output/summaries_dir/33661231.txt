we propose an efficient optical electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) cooling scheme for a cantilever with a nitrogen - vacancy center attached in a non - uniform magnetic field using dynamical zeeman effect . in our scheme , the zeeman effect combined with the quantum interference effect enhances the desired cooling transition and suppresses the undesired heating transitions . as a result , the cantilever can be cooled down to nearly the vibrational ground state under realistic experimental conditions within a short time . this efficient optical eit cooling scheme can be reduced to the typical eit cooling scheme under special conditions .
