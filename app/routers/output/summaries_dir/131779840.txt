we improve the flexibility in designing access structures of quantum stabilizer - based secret sharing schemes for classical secrets , by introducing message randomization in their encoding procedures . we generalize the gilbert - varshamov bound for deterministic encoding to randomized encoding of classical secrets . we also provide an explicit example of a ramp secret sharing scheme with which multiple symbols in its classical secret are revealed to an intermediate set , and justify the necessity of incorporating strong security criterion of conventional secret sharing . finally , we propose an explicit construction of strongly secure ramp secret sharing scheme by quantum stabilizers , which can support twice as large classical secrets as the mceliece - sarwate strongly secure ramp secret sharing scheme of the same share size and the access structure .
