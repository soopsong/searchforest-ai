we show that inseparability of quantum states can be partially broadcasted ( copied , cloned ) with the help of local operations , i.e. distant parties sharing an entangled pair of spin 1/2 states can generate two pairs of partially nonlocally entangled states using only local operations . this procedure can be viewed as an inversion of quantum purification procedures .
