entanglement of pure states of bipartite quantum systems has been shown to have a unique measure in terms of the von neumann entropy of the reduced states of either of its subsystems . the measure is established under entanglement manipulation of an asymptotically large number of copies of the states . in this paper , different asymptotic measures of entanglement assigned to arbitrary sequences of bipartite pure states are shown to coincide only when the sequence is information stable , in terms of the quantum spectral information rates of the sequence of subsystem states . additional bounds on the optimal rates of entanglement manipulation protocols in quantum information are also presented , including bounds given by generalizations of the coherent information and the relative entropy of entanglement .
