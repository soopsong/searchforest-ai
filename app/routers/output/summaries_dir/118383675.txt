we demonstrate a fiber - based source of polarization - entangled photon pairs at visible wavelengths suitable for integration with local quantum processing schemes . the photons are created through birefringent phase - matching in spontaneous four - wave mixing inside a sagnac interferometer . we address entanglement degradation due to temporal distinguishability of the photons to enable the generation of a spectrally unfiltered polarization - entangled photon - pair state with $ 95.86\pm0.10%$ fidelity to a maximally entangled bell state , evaluated with a tomographic state reconstruction without applying any corrections or background subtractions . owing to the large birefringence of the fiber , photons are created far detuned from the pump , where raman contamination is negligible . this source 's spatial mode and ability to produce spectrally uncorrelated photons make it suitable for implementing quantum information protocols over free - space and fiber - based networks .
