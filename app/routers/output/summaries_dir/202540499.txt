optomechanical systems attract a lot of attention because they provide a novel platform for quantum measurements , transduction , hybrid systems , and fundamental studies of quantum physics . their classical nonlinear dynamics is surprisingly rich and so far remains underexplored . works devoted to this subject have typically focussed on dissipation constants which are substantially larger than those encountered in current experiments , such that the nonlinear dynamics of weakly dissipative optomechanical systems is almost uncharted waters . in this work , we fill this gap and investigate the regular and chaotic dynamics in this important regime . to analyze the dynamical attractors , we have extended the"generalized alignment index"method to dissipative systems . we show that , even when chaotic motion is absent , the dynamics in the weakly dissipative regime is extremely sensitive to initial conditions . we argue that reducing dissipation allows chaotic dynamics to appear at a substantially smaller driving strength and enables various routes to chaos . we identify three generic features in weakly dissipative classical optomechanical nonlinear dynamics : the neimark - sacker bifurcation between limit cycles and limit tori ( leading to a comb of sidebands in the spectrum ) , the quasiperiodic route to chaos , and the existence of transient chaos .
