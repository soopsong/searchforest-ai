in a recent paper , tilma , everitt { \it et al . } derived a generalized wigner function that can characterize both the discrete and continuous variable states , i.e. , hybrid states . as such , one can expect that the negativity of the generalized wigner function applied to the hybrid states can reveal their nonclassicality , in analogy with the well - known wigner function defined for the continuous variable states . in this work , we demonstrate that , indeed , the negativity volume of the generalized wigner function of the hybrid bipartite states can be used as an entanglement witness for such states , provided that it exceeds a certain critical value . in particular , we study hybrid bipartite qubit - bosonic states and provide a qubit - schr\"{o}dinger cat state as an example . since the detection of the generalized wigner function of hybrid bipartite states in phase space can be experimentally simpler than the tomographic reconstruction of the corresponding density matrix , our results , therefore , present a convenient tool in the entanglement identification of such states .
