the codeword stabilized ( cws ) quantum codes formalism presents a unifying approach to both additive and nonadditive quantum error - correcting codes ( arxiv:0708.1021 [ quant - ph ] ) , but only for binary states . here we generalize the cws framework to the nonbinary case ( of both prime and nonprime dimension ) and map the search for nonbinary quantum codes to a corresponding search problem for classical nonbinary codes with specific error patterns . we show that while the additivity properties of nonbinary cws codes are similar to the binary case , the structural properties of the nonbinary codes differ substantially from the binary case , even for prime dimensions . in particular , we identify specific structure patterns of stabilizer groups , based on which efficient constructions might be possible for codes that encode more dimensions than any stabilizer codes of the same length and distance ; similar methods can not be applied in the binary case . understanding of these structural properties can help prune the search space and facilitate the identification of good nonbinary cws codes .
