an emerging and challenging area in mathematical control theory called ensemble control encompasses a class of problems that involves the guidance of an uncountably infinite collection of structurally identical dynamical systems , which are indexed by a parameter set , by applying the same open - loop control . the subject originates from the study of complex spin dynamics in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy and imaging ( mri ) . a fundamental question concerns ensemble controllability , which determines the existence of controls that transfer the system between desired initial and target states . for ensembles of finite - dimensional time - varying linear systems , the necessary and sufficient controllability conditions and analytical optimal control laws have been shown to depend on the singular system of the operator characterizing the system dynamics . because analytical solutions are available only in the simplest cases , there is a need to develop numerical methods for synthesizing these controls . we introduce a direct , accurate , and computationally efficient algorithm based on the singular value decomposition ( svd ) that approximates ensemble controls of minimum norm for such systems . this method enables the application of ensemble control to engineering problems involving complex , time - varying , and high - dimensional linear dynamic systems .
