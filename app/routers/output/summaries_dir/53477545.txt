when quantum information is encoded in optical polarization , practical protocols must contend with the fact that preparation and measurement reference frames may be misaligned , owing to physical orientations and birefringence effects . for long - distance transmissions , a common solution involves multiplexing strong classical reference signals , providing a basis for correction . here we numerically investigate the performance of a polarization - frame alignment protocol utilizing single - photon - level signals and measurements , in the context of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) over channels with detector noise and imperfect sources . to the extent possible , the same states and measurement bases are used as for the qkd protocol we intend to support . our results show that a small fraction of resources from the overall signal --- a few hundred photon detections , in total --- are required for good performance , restoring the state to better than 99 % of its original quality , and we illustrate the protocol 's successful operation and adaptability through experimental demonstrations in which it was used in the laboratory and the field .
