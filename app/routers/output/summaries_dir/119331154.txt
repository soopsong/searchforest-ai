the ability to amplify light within silicon waveguides is central to the development of high - performance silicon photonic device technologies . to this end , the large optical nonlinearities made possible through stimulated brillouin scattering offer a promising avenue for power - efficient all - silicon amplifiers , with recent demonstrations producing several db of net amplification . however , scaling the degree of amplification to technologically compelling levels ( > 10 db ) , necessary for everything from filtering to small signal detection , remains an important goal . here , we significantly enhance the brillouin amplification process by harnessing an inter - modal brillouin interaction within a multi - spatial - mode silicon racetrack resonator . using this approach , we demonstrate more than 20 db of net brillouin amplification in silicon , advancing state - of - the - art performance by a factor of 30 . this degree of amplification is achieved with modest ( ~15 mw ) continuous - wave pump powers and produces low out - of - band noise . moreover , we show that this same system behaves as a unidirectional amplifier , providing more than 28 db of optical nonreciprocity without insertion loss in an all - silicon platform . building on these results , this device concept opens the door to new types of all - silicon injection - locked brillouin lasers , high - performance photonic filters , and waveguide - compatible distributed optomechanical phenomena .
