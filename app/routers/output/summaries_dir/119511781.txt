we describe how to use the fidelity decay as a tool to characterize the errors affecting a quantum information processor through a noise generator $ g_{\tau}$. for weak noise , the initial decay rate of the fidelity proves to be a simple way to measure the magnitude of the different terms in $ g_{\tau}$. when the generator has only terms associated with few - body couplings , our proposal is scalable . we present the explicit protocol for estimating the magnitude of the noise generators when the noise consists of only one and two - body terms , and describe a method for measuring the parameters of more general noise models . the protocol focuses on obtaining the magnitude with which these terms affect the system during a time step of length $ \tau$ ; measurement of this information has critical implications for assesing the scalability of fault - tolerant quantum computation in any physical setup .
