i discuss how to perform fault - tolerant quantum computation with concatenated codes using local gates in small numbers of dimensions . i show that a threshold result still exists in three , two , or one dimensions when next - to - nearest - neighbor gates are available , and present explicit constructions . in two or three dimensions , i also show how nearest - neighbor gates can give a threshold result . in all cases , i simply demonstrate that a threshold exists , and do not attempt to optimize the error correction circuit or determine the exact value of the threshold . the additional overhead due to the fault - tolerance in both space and time is polylogarithmic in the error rate per logical gate .
