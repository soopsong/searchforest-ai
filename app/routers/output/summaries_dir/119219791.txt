we analyze the coupling of atoms or atom - like emitters to nanophotonic waveguides in the presence of propagating acoustic waves . specifically , we show that strong index modulations induced by such waves can drastically modify the effective photonic density of states and thereby influence the strength , the directionality , as well as the overall characteristics of photon emission and absorption processes . these effects enable a complete dynamical control of light - matter interactions in waveguide structures , which even in a two dimensional system can be used to efficiently exchange individual photons along selected directions and with a very high fidelity . such a quantum acousto - optical control provides a versatile tool for various quantum networking applications ranging from the distribution of entanglement via directional emitter - emitter interactions to the routing of individual photonic quantum states via acoustic conveyor belts .
