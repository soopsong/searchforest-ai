we try to minimize the number of qubits needed to factor an integer of n bits using shor 's algorithm on a quantum computer . we introduce a circuit which uses 2n+3 qubits and o(n^3 lg(n ) ) elementary quantum gates in a depth of o(n^3 ) to implement the factorization algorithm . the circuit is computable in polynomial time on a classical computer and is completely general as it does not rely on any property of the number to be factored . keywords : factorization , quantum circuits , modular arithmetics
