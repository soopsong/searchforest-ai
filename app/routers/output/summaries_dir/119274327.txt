we argue that the semiclassical analysis of the black hole information paradox is incomplete and has to be completed by an explicit entanglement of matter and quantum gravity degrees of freedom . we study in detail the evaporation process from beginning to end in the light of our extension and show that a pure initial state remains pure over the full evaporation process , including the final state which remains after the black hole has completely evaporated .
