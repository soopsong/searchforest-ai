in this paper , we will try to present a general formalism for the construction of { \it deformed photon - added nonlinear coherent states } ( dpancss ) $ |\alpha , f , m>$ , which in special case lead to the well - known photon - added coherent state ( pacs ) $ |\alpha , m>$. some algebraic structures of the introduced dpancss are studied and particularly the resolution of the identity , as the most important property of generalized coherent states , is investigated . meanwhile , it will be demonstrated that , the introduced states can also be classified in the $ f$-deformed coherent states , with a special nonlinearity function . next , we will show that , these states can be produced through a simple theoretical scheme . a discussion on the dpancss with negative values of $ m$ , i.e. , $ |\alpha , f , -m>$ , is then presented . our approach , has the potentiality to be used for the construction of a variety of new classes of dpancss , corresponding to any nonlinear oscillator with known nonlinearity function , as well as arbitrary solvable quantum system with known discrete , nondegenerate spectrum . finally , after applying the formalism to a particular physical system known as p\"oschl - teller ( p - t ) potential and the nonlinear coherent states corresponding to a specific nonlinearity function $ f(n)=\sqrt n$ , some of the nonclassical properties such as mandel parameter , second order correlation function , in addition to first and second - order squeezing of the corresponding states will be investigated , numerically .
