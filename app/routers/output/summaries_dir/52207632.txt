einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) steering allows alice to remotely prepare a state in some specific bases for bob through her choice of measurements . the temporal analogue of epr steering , temporal steering , also reveals the steerability of a single system between different times . focusing on a four - dimensional system , here we investigate the dynamics of the temporal steering measures , the temporal steering robustness , using 5 mutually unbiased bases . as an example of an application , we use these measures to examine the temporal correlations in a radical pair model of magnetoreception . we find that , due to interactions with a static nuclear spin , the radical pair model exhibits strong non - markovianity .
