density matrices of graphs are combinatorial laplacians normalized to have trace one ( braunstein \emph{et al . } \emph{phys . rev . a , } \textbf{73}:1 , 012320 ( 2006 ) ) . if the vertices of a graph are arranged as an array , then its density matrix carries a block structure with respect to which properties such as separability can be considered . we prove that the so - called degree - criterion , which was conjectured to be necessary and sufficient for separability of density matrices of graphs , is equivalent to the ppt - criterion . as such it is not sufficient for testing the separability of density matrices of graphs ( we provide an explicit example ) . nonetheless , we prove the sufficiency when one of the array dimensions has length two ( for an alternative proof see wu , \emph{phys . lett . a}\textbf{351 } ( 2006 ) , no . 1 - 2 , 18 - -22 ) . finally we derive a rational upper bound on the concurrence of density matrices of graphs and show that this bound is exact for graphs on four vertices .
