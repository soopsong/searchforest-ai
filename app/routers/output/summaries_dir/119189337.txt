we compute the bulk entanglement entropy of a massive scalar field in a poincare ads with the dirichlet and neumann boundary condition when we trace out a half space . moreover , by taking into account the quantum back reaction to the minimal surface area , we calculate how much the entanglement entropy changes under a double - trace deformation of a holographic cft . in the ads3 / cft2 setup , our result agrees with the known result in 2d cfts . in higher dimensions , our results offer holographic predictions .
