we propose a hybrid system composed of a majorana qubit and a nanomechanical resonator , implemented by a spin - orbit - coupled superconducting nanowire , using a set of static and oscillating ferromagnetic gates . the ferromagnetic gates induce majorana bound states in the nanowire , which hybridize and constitute a majorana qubit . due to the oscillation of one of these gates , the majorana qubit can be coherently rotated . by tuning the gate voltage to modulate the local spin - orbit coupling , it is possible to reach the resonance of the qubit - oscillator system for relatively strong couplings .
