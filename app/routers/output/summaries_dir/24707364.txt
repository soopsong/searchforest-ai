we examine in details the connections between topological and entanglement properties of short - range resonating valence bond ( rvb ) wave functions using projected entangled pair states ( peps ) on kagome and square lattices on ( quasi-)infinite cylinders with generalized boundary conditions ( and perimeters with up to 20 lattice spacings ) . making use of disconnected topological sectors in the space of dimer lattice coverings , we explicitly derive ( orthogonal)"minimally entangled"peps rvb states . for the kagome lattice , we obtain , using the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet as a reference model , the finite size scaling of the energy separations between these states . in particular , we extract two separate ( vanishing ) energy scales corresponding ( i ) to insert a vison line between the two ends of the cylinder and ( ii ) to pull out and freeze a spin at either end . we also investigate the relations between bulk and boundary properties and show that , for a bipartition of the cylinder , the boundary hamiltonian defined on the edge can be written as a product of a highly non - local projector with an emergent ( local ) su(2)-invariant one - dimensional ( superfluid ) t -- j hamiltonian , which arises due to the symmetry properties of the auxiliary spins at the edge . this multiplicative structure , a consequence of the disconnected topological sectors in the space of dimer lattice coverings , is characteristic of the topological nature of the states . for minimally entangled rvb states , it is shown that the entanglement spectrum , which reflects the properties of the edge modes , is a subset ( half for kagome rvb ) of the spectrum of the local hamiltonian , providing e.g. a simple argument on the origin of the topological entanglement entropy s0=-ln 2 of z2 spin liquids . we propose to use these features to probe topological phases in microscopic hamiltonians and some results are compared to existing dmrg data .
