we study the non - equilibrium behavior of optically driven dissipative coupled resonator arrays . assuming each resonator is coupled with a two - level system via a jaynes - cummings interaction , we calculate the many - body steady state behavior of the system under coherent pumping and dissipation . we propose and analyze the many - body phases using experimentally accessible quantities such as the total excitation number , the emitted photon spectra and photon coherence functions for different parameter regimes . in parallel , we also compare and contrast the expected behavior of this system assuming the local nonlinearity in the cavities is generated by a generic kerr effect rather than a jaynes - cummings interaction . we find that the behavior of the experimentally accessible observables produced by the two models differs for realistic regimes of interactions even when the corresponding nonlinearities are of similar strength . we analyze in detail the extra features available in the jaynes - cummings - hubbard ( jch ) model originating from the mixed nature of the excitations and investigate the regimes where the kerr approximation would faithfully match the jch physics . we find that the latter is true for values of the light - matter coupling and losses beyond the reach of current technology . throughout the study we operate in the weak pumping , fully quantum mechanical regime where approaches such as mean field theory fail , and instead use a combination of quantum trajectories and the time evolving block decimation algorithm to compute the relevant steady state observables . in our study we have assumed small to medium size arrays ( from 3 up to 16 sites ) and values of the ratio of coupling to dissipation rate $ g/\gamma \sim 20 $ which makes our results implementable with current designs in circuit qed and with near future photonic crystal set ups .
