optimal control techniques are applied for the decomposition of unitary quantum operations into a sequence of single - qubit gates and entangling operations . to this end , we modify a gradient - ascent algorithm developed for systems of coupled nuclear spins in molecules to make it suitable for trapped ion quantum computing . we decompose unitary operations into entangling gates that are based on a nonlinear collective spin operator and complemented by global spinflip and local light shift gates . among others , we provide explicit decompositions of controlled - not and toffoli gates , and a simple quantum error correction protocol .
