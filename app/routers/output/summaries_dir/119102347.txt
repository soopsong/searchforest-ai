the quantum state of a $ d$-dimensional system can be represented by the $ d^2 $ probabilities corresponding to a sic - povm , and then this distribution of probability can be represented by a vector of $ \r^{d^2 - 1}$ in a simplex , we will call this set of vectors $ \mathcal{q}$. other way of represent a $ d$-dimensional system is by the corresponding bloch vector also in $ \r^{d^2 - 1}$ , we will call this set of vectors $ \mathcal{b}$. in this paper it is proved that with the adequate scaling $ \mathcal{b}=\mathcal{q}$. also we indicate some features of the shape of $ \mathcal{q}$.
