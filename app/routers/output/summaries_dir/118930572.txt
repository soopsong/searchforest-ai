many quantum algorithms can be represented in a form of a classical circuit positioned between quantum fourier transformations . motivated by the search for new quantum algorithms , we turn to circuits where the latter transformation is replaced by the $ \textsf{su}(2)$ quantum schur transform -- a global transformation which maps the computational basis to a basis defined by angular momenta . we show that the output distributions of these circuits can be approximately classically sampled in polynomial time if they are sufficiently close to being sparse , thus isolating a regime in which these quantum $ \textsf{su}(2)$ schur circuits could lead to algorithms with exponential computational advantage . our work is primarily motivated by a conjecture that underpinned the hardness of permutational quantum computing , a restricted quantum computational model that has the above circuit structure in one of its computationally interesting regimes . the conjecture stated that approximating transition amplitudes of permutational quantum computing model to inverse polynomial precision on a classical computer is computationally hard . we disprove the extended version of this conjecture -- even in the case when the hardness of approximation originated from a difficulty of finding the large elements in the output probability distributions . finally , we present some evidence that output of the above permutational quantum computing circuits could be efficiently approximately sampled from on a classical computer .
