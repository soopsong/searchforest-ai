the motzkin and fredkin quantum spin chains are described by frustration - free hamiltonians recently introduced and studied because of their anomalous behaviors in the correlation functions and in the entanglement properties . in this paper we analyze their quantum dynamical properties , focusing in particular on the time evolution of the excitations driven by a quantum quench , looking at the correlations functions of spin operators defined along different directions , and discussing the results in relation with the cluster decomposition property .
