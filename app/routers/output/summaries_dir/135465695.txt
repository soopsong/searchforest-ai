in this paper , we study extended linear regression approaches for quantum state tomography based on regularization techniques . for unknown quantum states represented by density matrices , performing measurements under certain basis yields random outcomes , from which a classical linear regression model can be established . first of all , for complete or over - complete measurement bases , we show that the empirical data can be utilized for the construction of a weighted least squares estimate ( lse ) for quantum tomography . taking into consideration the trace - one condition , a constrained weighted lse can be explicitly computed , being the optimal unbiased estimation among all linear estimators . next , for general measurement bases , we show that $ \ell_2$-regularization with proper regularization gain provides even lower mean - square error under a cost in bias . the regularization parameter is tuned by two estimators in terms of a risk characterization . finally , a concise and unified formula is established for the regularization parameter with complete measurement basis under an equivalent regression model , which proves that the proposed tuning estimators are asymptotically optimal as the number of samples grows to infinity under the risk metric . additionally , numerical examples are provided to validate the established results .
