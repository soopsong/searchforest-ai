we consider generic $ m\times n$-mode bipartitions of continuous variable systems , and study the associated bisymmetric multimode gaussian states . they are defined as $ ( m+n)$-mode gaussian states invariant under local mode permutations on the $ m$-mode and $ n$-mode subsystems . we prove that such states are equivalent , under local unitary transformations , to the tensor product of a two - mode state and of $ m+n-2 $ uncorrelated single - mode states . the entanglement between the $ m$-mode and the $ n$-mode blocks can then be completely concentrated on a single pair of modes by means of local unitary operations alone . this result allows to prove that the ppt ( positivity of the partial transpose ) condition is necessary and sufficient for the separability of $ ( m + n)$-mode bisymmetric gaussian states . we determine exactly their negativity and identify a subset of bisymmetric states whose multimode entanglement of formation can be computed analytically . we consider explicit examples of pure and mixed bisymmetric states and study their entanglement scaling with the number of modes .
