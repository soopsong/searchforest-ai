calculating the physical properties of quantum thermal states is a difficult problem for classical computers , rendering it intractable for most quantum many - body systems . a quantum computer , by contrast , would make many of these calculations feasible in principle , but it is still non - trivial to prepare a given thermal state or sample from it . it is also not known how to prepare special simple purifications of thermal states known as thermofield doubles , which play an important role in quantum many - body physics and quantum gravity . to address this problem , we propose a variational scheme to prepare approximate thermal states on a quantum computer by applying a series of two - qubit gates to a product mixed state . we apply our method to a non - integrable region of the mixed field ising chain and the sachdev - ye - kitaev model . we also demonstrate how our method can be easily extended to large systems governed by local hamiltonians and the preparation of thermofield double states . by comparing our results with exact solutions , we find that our construction enables the efficient preparation of approximate thermal states on quantum devices . our results can be interpreted as implying that the details of the many - body energy spectrum are not needed to capture simple thermal observables .
