the fairness of a secure multi - party quantum key agreement ( mqka ) protocol requires that all involved parties are entirely peer entities and can equally influence the outcome of the protocol to establish a shared key wherein no one can decide the shared key alone . however , it is found that parts of the existing mqka protocols are sensitive to collusion attacks , i.e. , some of the dishonest participants can collaborate to predetermine the final key without being detected . in this paper , a multi - party qka protocol resisting collusion attacks is proposed . different from previous qka protocol resisting $ n-1 $ coconspirators or resisting $ 1 $ coconspirators , we investigate the general circle - type mqka protocol which can be secure against $ t$ dishonest participants ' cooperation . here , $ t < n$. we hope the results of the presented paper will be helpful for further research on fair mqka protocols .
