we study an optomechanical system in which a microwave field and an optical field are coupled to a common mechanical resonator . we explore methods that use these mechanical resonators to store quantum mechanical states and to transduce states between the electromagnetic resonators from the perspective of the effect of mechanical decoherence . besides being of fundamental interest , this coherent quantum state transfer could have important practical implications in the field of quantum information science , as it potentially allows one to overcome intrinsic limitations of both microwave and optical platforms . we discuss several state transfer protocols and study their transfer fidelity using a fully quantum mechanical model that utilizes quantum state - diffusion techniques . this work demonstrates that mechanical decoherence should not be an insurmountable obstacle in realizing high fidelity storage and transduction .
