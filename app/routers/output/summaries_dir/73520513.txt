in this paperwe propose two theoretical schemes for implementation of quantum phase gates by engineering the phase - sensitive dark state of two atoms subjected to rydberg - rydberg interaction . combining the conventional adiabatic techniques and currently developed approaches of phase control , a feasible proposal for implementation of a geometric phase gate is presented , where the conditional phase shift ( berry phase ) is achieved by adiabatically and cyclically changing the parameters of the driving fields . here we find that the geometric phase acquired is related to the way how the relative phase is modulated . in the second scheme , the system hamiltonian is adiabatically changed in a noncyclic manner , so that the acquired conditional phase is not a berry phase . a detailed analysis of the experimental feasibility and the effect of decoherence is also given . the proposed schemes provide new perspectives for adiabatic manipulation of interacting rydberg systems with tailored phase modulation .
