we present a protocol to store a polynomial number of arbitrary bit strings , encoded as spin configurations , in the approximately degenerate low - energy manifold of an all - to - all connected ising spin glass . the iterative protocol is inspired by machine learning techniques utilizing $ k$-local hopfield networks trained with $ k$-local hebbian learning and unlearning . the trained hamiltonian is the basis of a quantum state - preparation scheme to create quantum many - body superpositions with tunable squared amplitudes using resources available in near term experiments . we find that the number of configurations that can be stored in the ground states and thus turned into superposition scales with the $ k$-locality of the ising interaction .
