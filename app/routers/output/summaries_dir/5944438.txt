this paper investigates transient performance of inverter - based microgrids in terms of the resistive power losses incurred in regulating frequency under persistent stochastic disturbances . we model the inverters as second - order oscillators and compare two algorithms for frequency regulation : the standard frequency droop controller and a distributed proportional - integral ( pi ) controller . the transient power losses can be quantified using an input - output h2 norm . we show that the distributed pi - controller , which has previously been proposed for secondary frequency control ( the elimination of static errors ) , also has the potential to significantly improve performance by reducing transient power losses . this loss reduction is shown to be larger in a loosely interconnected network than in a highly interconnected one , whereas losses do not depend on connectivity if standard droop control is employed . moreover , our results indicate that there is an optimal tuning of the distributed pi - controller for loss reduction . overall , our results provide an additional argument in favor of distributed algorithms for secondary frequency control in microgrids .
