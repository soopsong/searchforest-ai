robust control design for quantum unitary transformations has been recognized as a fundamental and challenging task in the development of quantum information processing due to unavoidable decoherence or operational errors in the experimental implementation of quantum operations . in this paper , we extend the systematic methodology of sampling - based learning control ( slc ) approach with a gradient flow algorithm for the design of robust quantum unitary transformations . the slc approach first uses a"training"process to find an optimal control strategy robust against certain ranges of uncertainties . then a number of randomly selected samples are tested and the performance is evaluated according to their average fidelity . the approach is applied to three typical examples of robust quantum transformation problems including robust quantum transformations in a three - level quantum system , in a superconducting quantum circuit , and in a spin chain system . numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the slc approach and show its potential applications in various implementation of quantum unitary transformations .
