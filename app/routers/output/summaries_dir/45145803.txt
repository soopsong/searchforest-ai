in this article , we report the recent progress on decoherence dynamics of electrons in quantum dot quantum computing systems using the exact master equation we derived recently based on the feynman - vernon influence functional approach . the exact master equation is valid for general nanostructure systems coupled to multi - reservoirs with arbitrary spectral densities , temperatures and biases . we take the double quantum dot charge qubit system as a specific example , and discuss in details the decoherence dynamics of the charge qubit under coherence controls . the decoherence dynamics risen from the entanglement between the system and the environment is mainly non - markovian . we further discuss the decoherence of the double - dot charge qubit induced by quantum point contact ( qpc ) measurement where the master equation is re - derived using the keldysh non - equilibrium green function technique due to the non - linear coupling between the charge qubit and the qpc . the non - markovian decoherence dynamics in the measurement processes is extensively discussed as well .
