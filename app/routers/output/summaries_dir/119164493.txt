we compute the ground state correlation functions of an exactly solvable chain of integer spins , recently introduced in [ r. movassagh and p. w. shor , arxiv:1408.1657 ] , whose ground - state can be expressed in terms of a uniform superposition of all colored motzkin paths . our analytical results show that for spin s$\ge$2 there is a violation of the cluster decomposition property . this has to be contrasted with s=1 , where the cluster property holds . correspondingly , for s=1 one gets a light - cone profile in the propagation of excitations after a local quench , while the cone is absent for s=2 , as shown by time dependent density - matrix - renormalization - group . moreover , we introduce an original solvable model of half - integer spins which we refer to as fredkin spin chain , whose ground - state can be expressed in terms of superposition of all dyck paths . for this model we exactly calculate the magnetization and correlation functions , finding that for s=1/2 , a cone - like propagation occurs while for higher spins , s$\ge$3/2 , the colors prevent any cone formation and clustering is violated , together with square root deviation from the area law for the entanglement entropy .
