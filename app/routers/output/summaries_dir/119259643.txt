we propose two optimal entanglement concentration protocols ( ecps ) for arbitrary single - photon multi - mode w state and multi - photon polarization w state , respectively . in both ecps , we only require one pair of partially entangled w state , and do not consume any auxiliary photon . both ecps are based on the linear optics which can be easily realized . on the other hand , the concentrated maximally entangled states can be remained , which are quite different from the previous ecps . moreover , for the concentration of the arbitrary single - photon n - mode w state or n - mode polarization w state , the total success probability is equal to nth the modulus square of the schmidt coefficient of the smallest magnitude . it makes both ecps optimal than all the previous ecps . our ecps may be useful in current quantum communication fields .
