we investigate classical and quantum correlations of a quantum field in the inflationary universe using a particle detector model . by considering the entanglement and correlations between two comoving detectors interacting with a scalar field , we find that the entanglement between the detectors becomes zero after their physical separation exceeds the hubble horizon . furthermore , the quantum discord , which is defined as the quantum part of total correlation , approaches zero on super horizon scale . these behaviors support appearance of classical nature of the quantum fluctuation generated during the inflationary era .
