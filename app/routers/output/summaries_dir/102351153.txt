this paper extends the karhunen - loeve representation from classical gaussian random processes to quantum wiener processes which model external bosonic fields for open quantum systems . the resulting expansion of the quantum wiener process in the vacuum state is organised as a series of sinusoidal functions on a bounded time interval with statistically independent coefficients consisting of noncommuting position and momentum operators in a gaussian quantum state . a similar representation is obtained for the solution of a linear quantum stochastic differential equation which governs the system variables of an open quantum harmonic oscillator . this expansion is applied to computing a quadratic - exponential functional arising as a performance criterion in the framework of risk - sensitive control for this class of open quantum systems .
