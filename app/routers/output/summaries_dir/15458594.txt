in this paper we present a simulation environment enhanced with parallel processing which can be used on personal computers , based on a high - level user interface developed on mathematica\copyright which is connected to c++ code in order to make our platform capable of communicating with a graphics processing unit . we introduce the reader to the behavior of our proposal by simulating a quantum adiabatic algorithm designed for solving hard instances of the 3-sat problem . we show that our simulator is capable of significantly increasing the number of qubits that can be simulated using classical hardware . finally , we present a review of currently available classical simulators of quantum systems together with some justifications , based on our willingness to further understand processing properties of nature , for devoting resources to building more powerful simulators .
