we describe an experimental protocol to characterize magnetic field dependent microwave losses in superconducting niobium microstrip resonators . our approach provides a unified view that covers two well - known magnetic field dependent loss mechanisms : quasiparticle generation and vortex motion . we find that quasiparticle generation is the dominant loss mechanism for parallel magnetic fields . for perpendicular fields , the dominant loss mechanism is vortex motion or switches from quasiparticle generation to vortex motion , depending on cooling procedures . in particular , we introduce a plot of the quality factor versus the resonance frequency as a general method for identifying the dominant loss mechanism . we calculate the expected resonance frequency and the quality factor as a function of the magnetic field by modeling the complex resistivity . key parameters characterizing microwave loss are estimated from comparisons of the observed and expected resonator properties . based on these key parameters , we find a niobium resonator whose thickness is similar to its penetration depth is the best choice for x - band electron spin resonance applications . finally , we detect partial release of the meissner current at the vortex penetration field , suggesting that the interaction between vortices and the meissner current near the edges is essential to understand the magnetic field dependence of the resonator properties .
