we analyze two two - mode continuous variable separable states with the same marginal states . we adopt the definition of classicality in the form of well - defined positive wigner function describing the state and find that although the states possess positive local wigner functions , they exhibit negative wigner functions for the global states . using the negativity of wigner function as an indicator of nonclassicality , we show that despite these states possess different negativities of the wigner function , they do not reveal this difference as phase space nonclassicalities such as negativity of the mandel $ q$ parameter or quadrature squeezing . we then concentrate on quantum correlation of these states and show that quantum discord and local quantum uncertainty , as two well - defined measures of quantum correlation , manifest the difference between negativity of the wigner functions . the non - gaussianity of these states is also examined and show that the difference in behavior of their non - gaussianity is the same as the difference between negativity of their wigner functions . we also investigate the influence of correlation rank criterion and find that when the states can be produced locally from classical states , the wigner functions can not reveal their quantum correlations .
