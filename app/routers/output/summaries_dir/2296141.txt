the ability to generate entangled photon - pairs over a broad wavelength range opens the door to the simultaneous distribution of entanglement to multiple users in a network by using centralized sources and flexible wavelength - division multiplexing schemes . here we show the design of a metropolitan optical network consisting of tree - type access networks whereby entangled photon - pairs are distributed to any pair of users , independent of their location . the network is constructed employing commercial off - the - shelf components and uses the existing infrastructure , which allows for moderate deployment costs . we further develop a channel plan and a network - architecture design to provide a direct optical path between any pair of users , thus allowing classical and one - way quantum communication as well as entanglement distribution . this allows the simultaneous operation of multiple quantum information technologies . finally , we present a more flexible backbone architecture that pushes away the load limitations of the original network design by extending its reach , number of users and capabilities .
