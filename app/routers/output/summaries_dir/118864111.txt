we introduce an arbitrary number of accessible modes when analyzing bipartite entanglement degradation due to unruh effect between two partners alice and rob . under the single mode approximation ( sma ) a fermion field only had a few accessible levels due to pauli exclusion principle , conversely to bosonic fields which had an infinite number of excitable levels . this was argued to justify entanglement survival in the fermionic case in the sma infinite acceleration limit . here we relax sma . hence , an infinite number of modes are excited as the observer rob accelerates , even for a fermion field . we will prove that , despite this analogy with the bosonic case , entanglement loss is limited . we will show that this comes from fermionic statistics through the characteristic structure it imposes on the infinite dimensional density matrix for rob . surprisingly , the surviving entanglement is independent of the specific maximally entangled state chosen , the kind of fermionic field analyzed , and the number of accessible modes considered . we shall discuss whether this surviving entanglement goes beyond the purely statistical correlations , giving insight concerning the black hole information paradox .
