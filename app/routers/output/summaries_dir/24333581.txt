we study a quantum heat engine at strong coupling between the system and the thermal reservoirs . exploiting a collective coordinate mapping , we incorporate system - reservoir correlations into a consistent thermodynamic analysis , thus circumventing the usual restriction to weak coupling and vanishing correlations . we apply our formalism to the example of a quantum otto cycle , demonstrating that the performance of the engine is diminished in the strong coupling regime with respect to its weakly coupled counterpart , producing a reduced net work output and operating at a lower energy conversion efficiency . we identify costs imposed by sudden decoupling of the system and reservoirs around the cycle as being primarily responsible for the diminished performance , and define an alternative operational procedure which can partially recover the work output and efficiency . more generally , the collective coordinate mapping holds considerable promise for wider studies of thermodynamic systems beyond weak reservoir coupling .
