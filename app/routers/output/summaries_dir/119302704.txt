motivated by the desire to better understand the class of quantum operations on bipartite systems that preserve positivity of partial transpose ( ppt operations ) and its relation to the class locc ( local operations and classical communication ) , we present some results on deterministic bipartite pure state transformations by ppt operations . restricting our attention to the case where we start with a rank k maximally entangled state , we give a necessary condition for transforming it into a given pure state , which we show is also sufficient when k is two and the final state has schmidt rank three . we show that it is sufficient for all k and all final states provided a conjecture about a certain family of semidefinite programs is true . we also demonstrate that the phenomenon of catalysis can occur under ppt operations and that , unlike locc catalysis , a maximally entangled state can be a catalyst . finally , we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the possibility of transforming a rank k maximally entangled state to an arbitrary pure state by ppt operations assisted by some maximally entangled catalyst .
