we investigate coherent perfect absorption ( cpa ) in quantum optics , in particular when pairs of squeezed coherent states of light are superposed on an absorbing beam splitter . first , by employing quantum optical input - output relations , we derive the absorption coefficients for quantum coherence and for intensity , and reveal how these will differ for squeezed states . secondly , we present the remarkable properties of a cpa - gate : two identical but otherwise arbitrary incoming squeezed coherent states can be completely stripped off their coherence , producing a pure entangled squeezed vacuum state that with its finite intensity escapes from an otherwise perfect absorber . importantly , this output state of light is not entangled with the absorbing beam splitter by which it was produced . its loss - enabled functionality makes the cpa gate an interesting new tool for continuous - variable quantum state preparation .
