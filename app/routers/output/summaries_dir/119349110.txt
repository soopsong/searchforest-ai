various lower- and higher - order nonclassical properties have been studied for two physical systems- ( i ) an optomechanical system composed of a fabry - perot cavity with one nonlinearly oscillating mirror and ( ii ) an optomechanical - like system formed using a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) trapped inside an optical cavity . the investigation is performed using a perturbation method that leads to closed form analytic expressions for the time evolution of the relevant bosonic operators . in the first system , it is observed that the radiation pressure coupling leads to the emergence of lower- and higher - order squeezing , antibunching , entanglement and intermodal squeezing . the effects of the coherent interaction of a nonlinear oscillating mirror with the cavity mode are studied , and it is observed that the optomechanical system studied here becomes more nonclassical ( entangled ) when the coupling strength is increased . it is also observed that the possibility of observing entanglement depends on the phase of the movable mirror . the hamiltonian of the trapped bec system is obtained as a special case of the hamiltonian of the first system , and the existence of various nonclassicality in the trapped bec system has been established , and variations of those with various physical parameters have been reported with an aim to understand the underlying physical process that leads to and controls the nonclassicality .
