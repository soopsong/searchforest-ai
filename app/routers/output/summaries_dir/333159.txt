we show theoretically that networks of membrane memcapacitive systems -- capacitors with memory made out of membrane materials -- can be used to perform a complete set of logic gates in a massively parallel way by simply changing the external input amplitudes , but not the topology of the network . this polymorphism is an important characteristic of memcomputing ( computing with memories ) that closely reproduces one of the main features of the brain . a practical realization of these membrane memcapacitive systems , using , e.g. , graphene or other 2d materials , would be a step forward towards a solid - state realization of memcomputing with passive devices .
