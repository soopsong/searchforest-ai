we introduce a simulator for a quantum internet with the specific goal to support software development . a quantum internet consists of local quantum processors , which are interconnected by quantum communication channels that enable the transmission of qubits between the different processors . while many simulators exist for local quantum processors , there is presently no simulator for a quantum internet tailored towards software development . quantum internet protocols require both classical as well as quantum information to be exchanged between the network nodes , next to the execution of gates and measurements on a local quantum processor . this requires quantum internet software to integrate classical communication programming practises with novel quantum ones . simulaqron is built to enable application development and explore software engineering practises for a quantum internet . simulaqron can be run on one or more classical computers to simulate local quantum processors , which are transparently connected in the background to enable the transmission of qubits or the generation of entanglement between remote processors . application software can access the simulated local quantum processors to execute local quantum instructions and measurements , but also to transmit qubits to remote nodes in the network . simulaqron features a modular design that performs a distributed simulation based on any existing simulation of a quantum computer capable of integrating with python . programming libraries for python and c are provided to facilitate application development .
