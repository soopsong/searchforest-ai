we consider the entanglement dynamics between two unruh - dewitt detectors at rest separated at a distance $ d$. this simple model when analyzed properly in quantum field theory shows many interesting facets and helps to dispel some misunderstandings of entanglement dynamics . we find that there is spatial dependence of quantum entanglement in the stable regime due to the phase difference of vacuum fluctuations the two detectors experience , together with the interference of the mutual influences from the backreaction of one detector on the other . when two initially entangled detectors are still outside each other 's light cone , the entanglement oscillates in time with an amplitude dependent on spatial separation $ d$. when the two detectors begin to have causal contact , an interference pattern of the relative degree of entanglement ( compared to those at spatial infinity ) develops a parametric dependence on $ d$. the detectors separated at those $ d$ with a stronger relative degree of entanglement enjoy longer disentanglement times . in the cases with weak coupling and large separation , the detectors always disentangle at late times . for sufficiently small $ d$ , the two detectors can have residual entanglement even if they initially were in a separable state , while for $ d$ a little larger , there could be transient entanglement created by mutual influences . however , we see no evidence of entanglement creation outside the light cone for initially separable states .
