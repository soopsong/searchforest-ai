harmonic oscillator coherent states are well known to be the analogue of classical states . on the other hand , nonlinear and generalised coherent states may possess nonclassical properties . in this article , we study the nonclassical behaviour of nonlinear coherent states for generalised classes of models corresponding to the generalised ladder operators . a comparative analysis among them indicates that the models with quadratic spectrum are more nonclassical than the others . our central result is further underpinned by the comparison of the degree of nonclassicality of squeezed states of the corresponding models .
