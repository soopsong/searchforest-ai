although quantum control typically relies on greedy ( local ) optimization , traps ( irregular critical points ) in the control landscape can make optimization hard by foiling local search strategies . we demonstrate the failure of greedy algorithms to realize two fast quantum computing gates : a qutrit phase gate and a controlled - not gate . then we show that our evolutionary algorithm circumvents the trap to deliver effective quantum control in both instances . even when greedy algorithms succeed , our evolutionary algorithm delivers a superior control procedure because less time resolution is required for the control sequence .
