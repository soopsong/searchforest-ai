the interaction of quantum emitters with one - dimensional photon - like reservoirs induces strong and long - range dissipative couplings that give rise to the emergence of so - called decoherence free subspaces ( dfs ) which are decoupled from dissipation . when introducing weak perturbations on the emitters , e.g. , driving , the strong collective dissipation enforces an effective coherent evolution within the dfs . in this work , we show explicitly how by introducing single - site resolved drivings , we can use the effective dynamics within the dfs to design a universal set of one and two - qubit gates within the dfs of two - level atom - like systems . using liouvillian perturbation theory we calculate the scaling with the relevant figures of merit of the systems , such as the purcell factor and imperfect control of the drivings . finally , we compare our results with previous proposals using atomic $ \lambda$ systems in leaky cavities .
