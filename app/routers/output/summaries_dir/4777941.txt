understanding the dynamics of higher - dimensional quantum systems embedded in a complex environment remains a significant theoretical challenge . while several approaches yielding numerically converged solutions exist , these are computationally expensive and often provide only limited physical insight . here we address the question when more intuitive and simpler to compute weak - coupling approaches still provide adequate accuracy . we develop a simple analytical criterion and verify its validity for the case of the much - studied fmo dynamics as well as the canonical spin - boson model .
