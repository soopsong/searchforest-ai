we propose the realization of photonic circuits whose dynamics is governed by advanced - retarded differential equations . beyond their mathematical interest , these photonic configurations enable the implementation of quantum feedback and feedforward without requiring any intermediate measurement . we show how this protocol can be applied to implement interesting delay effects in the quantum regime , as well as in the classical limit . our results elucidate the potential of the protocol as a promising route towards integrated quantum control systems on a chip .
