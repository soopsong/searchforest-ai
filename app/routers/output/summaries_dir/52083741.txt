we investigate the behavior of qubits consisting of three electron spins in double and triple quantum dots subject to external electric fields . our model includes two independent bias parameters , $ \varepsilon$ and $ \varepsilon_{m}$ , which both couple to external electromagnetic fields and can be controlled by gate voltages applied to the quantum dot structures . by varying these parameters one can switch the qubit type by shifting the energies in the single quantum dots thus changing the electron occupancy in each dot . starting from the asymmetric resonant ( arx ) exchange qubit with a ( 2,0,1 ) and ( 1,0,2 ) charge admixture one can smoothly cross over to the resonant exchange ( rx ) qubit with a detuned ( 1,1,1 ) charge configuration , and to the exchange - only ( eo ) qubit with the same charge configuration but equal energy levels down to the hybrid qubits with ( 1,2,0 ) and ( 0,2,1 ) charge configurations . here , ( $ l , m , n$ ) describes a configuration with $ l$ electrons in the left dot , $ m$ electrons in the center dot , and $ n$ electrons in the right dot . we first focus on random electromagnetic field fluctuations , i.e . ,"charge noise " , at each quantum dot resulting in dephasing of the qubit and provide a complete map of the resulting dephasing time as a function of the bias parameters . we pay special attention to the so - called sweet spots and double sweet spots of the system which are least susceptible to noise . in the second part we investigate the coupling of the qubit system to the coherent quantized electromagnetic field in a superconducting strip - line cavity and also provide a complete map of the coupling strength as a function of the bias parameters . we analyze the asymmetric qubit - cavity coupling via $ \varepsilon$ and the symmetric coupling via $ \varepsilon_{m}$.
