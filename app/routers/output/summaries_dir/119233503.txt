microwave photons have become very important qubits in quantum communication as the first quantum satellite has been launched successfully . therefore , it is a necessary and meaningful task for ensuring the high security and efficiency of microwave - based quantum communication in practice . here , we present an original polarization entanglement purification protocol for nonlocal microwave photons based on the cross - kerr effect in circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . our protocol can solve the problem that the purity of maximally entangled states used for constructing quantum channels will decrease due to decoherence from environment noise . this task is accomplished by means of the polarization parity - check quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) detector , the bit - flipping operation , and the linear microwave elements . the qnd detector is composed of several cross - kerr effect systems which can be realized by coupling two superconducting transmission line resonators to a superconducting molecule with the n - type level structure . we give the applicable experimental parameters of qnd measurement system in circuit qed and analyze the fidelities . our protocol has good applications in long - distance quantum communication assisted by microwave photons in the future , such as satellite quantum communication .
