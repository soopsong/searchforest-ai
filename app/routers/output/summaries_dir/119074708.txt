we study the time evolution of bosonic systems where multiple driven bosonic modes of light interact with multiple mechanical resonators through arbitrary , time - dependent , optomechanical - like interactions . we find the analytical expression for the full time evolution of the system and compute the expectation value of relevant quantities of interest . among the most interesting ones , we are able to compute the first - order quantum bipartite coherence between pairs of subsystems , and the analytical expression for the mixedness induced by the nonlinear interaction in the reduced state of the mechanical oscillators . finally , we also compare our results with a linearised version of the system , and we find a regime where there are qualitative and quantitative differences in the behavior of some measurable quantities . our results can therefore be used to describe the full time - evolution of the system , to characterise its nonlinear character and explore the validity of the linearisation approach .
