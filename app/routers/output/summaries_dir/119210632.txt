an effective field theory for infalling observers in the vicinity of a quasi - static black hole is given in terms of a freely falling lattice discretization . the lattice model successfully reproduces the thermal spectrum of outgoing hawking radiation , as was shown by corley and jacobson , but can also be used to model observations made by a typical low - energy observer who enters the black hole in free fall at a prescribed time . the explicit short distance cutoff ensures that , from the viewpoint of the infalling observer , any quantum information that entered the black hole more than a scrambling time earlier has been erased by the black hole singularity . this property , combined with the requirement that outside observers need at least of order the scrambling time to extract quantum information from the black hole , ensures that a typical infalling observer does not encounter drama upon crossing the black hole horizon in a theory where black hole information is preserved for asymptotic observers .
