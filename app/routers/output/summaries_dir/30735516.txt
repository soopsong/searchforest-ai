we propose an implementation of a quantum computer to solve deutsch 's problem , which requires exponential time on a classical computer but only linear time with quantum parallelism . by using a dual - rail qubit representation as a simple form of error correction , our machine can tolerate some amount of decoherence and still give the correct result with high probability . the design which we employ also demonstrates a signature for quantum parallelism which unambiguously delineates the desired quantum behavior from the merely classical . the experimental demonstration of our proposal using quantum optical components calls for the development of several key technologies common to single photonics .
