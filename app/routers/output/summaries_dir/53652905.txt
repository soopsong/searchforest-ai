in the majorana or stellar representation of quantum states , an arbitrary ( pure ) state of a spin-1 system is represented by a pair of points on the unit sphere or , equivalently , by a pair of unit vectors . this paper presents an expression for the squared modulus of the inner product of two spin-1 states in terms of their majorana vectors and uses it to give a geometrical construction of the mubs and sic - povms of a spin-1 system . the results are not new and duplicate those obtained earlier by other methods , but the majorana approach nevertheless illuminates them from an unusual point of view . in particular , it reveals the mubs and sics as symmetrical collections of vectors in ordinary three - dimensional space , rather than as rays in a projective hilbert space . while it does not appear feasible to extend this treatment to higher spin systems , the spin-1 case exhibits sufficient subtlety and complexity to be worth spelling out for its pedagogical and historical interest .
