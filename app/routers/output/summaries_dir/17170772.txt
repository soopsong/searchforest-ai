the purpose of this paper is to present a theoretic and numerical study of utilizing squeezing and phase shift in coherent feedback control of linear quantum optical systems . a quadrature representation with built - in phase shifters is proposed for such systems . fundamental structural characterizations of linear quantum optical systems are derived in terms of the new quadrature representation . these results reveal considerable insights of issue of physical realizability of such quantum systems . the problem of coherent quantum lqg feedback control studied in [ 35,50 ] is re - investigated in depth . firstly , the optimization methods in [ 35,50 ] are extended to a multi - step optimization algorithm which utilizes ideal squeezers . secondly , a two - stage optimization approach is proposed on the basis of controller parametrization . numerical studies show that closed - loop systems designed via the second approach may offer lqg control performance even better than that when the closed - loop systems are in the vacuum state . when ideal squeezers in a close - loop system are replaced by ( more realistic ) degenerate parametric amplifiers , a sufficient condition is derived for the asymptotic stability of the resultant new closed - loop system ; the issue of performance convergence is also discussed in the lqg control setting .
