in the context of the 2-dimensional ( 2d ) polarization states of light , the degree of polarization p2 is equal to the maximum value of the degree of coherence over all possible bases . therefore , p2 can be referred to as the intrinsic degree of coherence of a 2d state . in addition to ( i ) the maximum degree of coherence interpretation , p2 also has the following interpretations : ( ii ) it is the frobenius distance between the state and the maximally incoherent identity state , ( iii ) it is the norm of the bloch - vector representing the state , ( iv ) it is the distance to the center - of - mass in a configuration of point masses with magnitudes equal to the eigenvalues of the state , ( v ) it is the visibility in a polarization interference experiment , and ( vi ) it is the weightage of the pure part of the state . among these six interpretations of p2 , the bloch vector norm , frobenius distance , and center of mass interpretations have previously been generalized to derive an analogous basis - independent measure pn for n - dimensional ( nd ) states . in this article , by extending the concepts of visibility , degree of coherence , and weightage of pure part to nd spaces , we show that these three remaining interpretations of p2 also generalize to the same quantity pn , establishing pn as the intrinsic degree of coherence of nd states . we then extend pn to the n ->infinity limit to quantify the intrinsic degree of coherence p_infinity of infinite - dimensional states in the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , photon number , and position - momentum degrees of freedom .
