despite the tremendous progress of quantum cryptography , efficient quantum communication over long distances ( > 1000 km ) remains an outstanding challenge due to fiber attenuation and operation errors accumulated over the entire communication distance . quantum repeaters , as a promising approach , can overcome both photon loss and operation errors , and hence significantly speedup the communication rate . depending on the methods used to correct loss and operation errors , all the proposed qr schemes can be classified into three categories ( generations ) . here we present the first systematic comparison of three generations of quantum repeaters by evaluating the cost of both temporal and physical resources , and identify the optimized quantum repeater architecture for a given set of experimental parameters . our work provides a roadmap for the experimental realizations of highly efficient quantum networks over transcontinental distances .
