this paper is concerned with open quantum systems whose dynamic variables satisfy canonical commutation relations and are governed by quantum stochastic differential equations . the latter are driven by quantum wiener processes which represent external boson fields . the system - field coupling operators are linear functions of the system variables . the hamiltonian consists of a nominal quadratic function of the system variables and an uncertain perturbation which is represented in a weyl quantization form . assuming that the nominal linear quantum system is stable , we develop sufficient conditions on the perturbation of the hamiltonian which guarantee robust mean square stability of the perturbed system . examples are given to illustrate these results for a class of hamiltonian perturbations in the form of trigonometric polynomials of the system variables .
