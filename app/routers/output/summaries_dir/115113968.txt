owing to its peculiar energy dispersion , the quantum capacitance property of graphene can be exploited in a two - dimensional layered capacitor configuration . using graphene and boron nitride respectively as the electrodes and the insulating dielectric , a strongly nonlinear behavior at zero bias and small voltages is obtained . when the temperature is sufficiently low , the strong nonlinear interaction emerging from the quantum capacitance exhibits a diverse range of phenomena . the proposed structure could take over the functionalities of nonlinear elements in many cryogenic quantum systems , and in particular , quantum electro - optics . it is shown that ultrastrong coupling is easily reached with small number of pump photons at temperatures around 1k and capacitor areas of the order of $ 1\mu{\textrm{m}}^2$. a measure of anharmonicity is defined and as potential applications , a qubit design as well as schemes for non - reciprocal devices such as an electromagnetic frequency circulator are discussed .
