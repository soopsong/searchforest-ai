distributed quantum computation requires quantum operations that act over a distance on error - correction encoded states of logical qubits , such as the transfer of qubits via teleportation . we evaluate the performance of several quantum error correction codes , and find that teleportation failure rates of one percent or more are tolerable when two levels of the [ [ 23,1,7 ] ] code are used . we present an analysis of performing quantum error correction ( qec ) on qec - encoded states that span two quantum computers , including the creation of distributed logical zeroes . the transfer of the individual qubits of a logical state may be multiplexed in time or space , moving serially across a single link , or in parallel across multiple links . we show that the performance and reliability penalty for using serial links is small for a broad range of physical parameters , making serial links preferable for a large , distributed quantum multicomputer when engineering difficulties are considered . such a multicomputer will be able to factor a 1,024-bit number using shor 's algorithm with a high probability of success .
