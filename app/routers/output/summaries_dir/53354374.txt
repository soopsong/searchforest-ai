ultracold molecules have experienced increasing attention in recent years . compared to ultracold atoms , they possess several unique properties that make them perfect candidates for the implementation of new quantum - technological applications in several fields , from quantum simulation to quantum sensing and metrology . in particular , ultracold molecules of two - electron atoms ( such as strontium or ytterbium ) also inherit the peculiar properties of these atomic species , above all the possibility to access metastable electronic states via direct excitation on optical clock transitions with ultimate sensitivity and accuracy . in this paper we report on the production and coherent manipulation of molecular bound states of two fermionic $ ^{173}$yb atoms in different electronic ( orbital ) states $ ^1$s$_0 $ and $ ^3$p$_0 $ in proximity of a scattering resonance involving atoms in different spin and electronic states , called orbital feshbach resonance . we demonstrate that orbital molecules can be coherently photoassociated starting from a gas of ground - state atoms in a three - dimensional optical lattices by observing several photoassociation and photodissociation cycles . we also show the possibility to coherently control the molecular internal state by using raman - assisted transfer to swap the nuclear spin of one of the atoms forming the molecule , thus demonstrating a powerful manipulation and detection tool of these molecular bound states . finally , by exploiting this peculiar detection technique we provide first information on the lifetime of the molecular states in a many - body setting , paving the way towards future investigations of strongly interacting fermi gases in a still unexplored regime .
