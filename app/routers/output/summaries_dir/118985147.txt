with a two step optimization method of entanglement witness , we analytically propose a set of necessary and sufficient entanglement criteria for four qubit symmetric greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) diagonal states . the criterion set contains four criteria . two of them are linear with density matrix elements . the other two criteria are nonlinear with density matrix elements . the criterion set has a nest structure . a proper subset of the criteria is necessary and sufficient for the entanglement of a proper subset of the states . we illustrate the nest structure of criterion set with the general werner state set and its superset the highly symmetric ghz diagonal state set , they are subsets of the symmetric ghz diagonal state set .
