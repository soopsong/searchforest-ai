an accurate modeling of a josephson junction that is embedded in an arbitrary environment is of crucial importance for qubit design . we present a formalism to obtain a lindblad master equation that describes the evolution of the system . as the qubit degrees of freedom oscillate with a well - defined frequency $ \omega_q$ , the environment only has to be modeled close to this frequency . different from alternative approaches , we show that this goal can be achieved by modeling the environment with only few degrees of freedom . we treat the example of a transmon qubit coupled to a stripline resonator . we derive the parameters of a dissipative single - mode jaynes - cummings model starting from first principles . we show that the leading contribution of the off - resonant modes is a correlated decay process involving both the qubit and the resonator mode . in particular , our results show that the effect of the off - resonant modes in the multi - mode jaynes - cummings model is perturbative in $ 1/ \omega_q$.
