we propose an experimental scheme to implement a second - order nonlocal superposition operation and its variants by way of hong - ou - mandel interference . the second - order coherent operations enable us to generate a noon state with high particle number in a heralded fashion and also can be used to enhance the entanglement properties of continuous variable states . we discuss the feasibility of our proposed scheme considering realistic experimental conditions such as on - off photodetectors with nonideal efficiency and imperfect single - photon sources .
