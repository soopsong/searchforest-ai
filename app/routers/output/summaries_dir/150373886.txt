single - photon sources are of great interest because they are key elements in different promising applications of quantum technologies . here we demonstrate a highly efficient tunable on - demand microwave single - photon source based on a transmon qubit with the intrinsic emission efficiency more than 99$\%$. to confirm the single - photon property of the source , we study the single - photon interference in a hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) type setup and measure the correlation functions of the emission field using linear detectors with a gpu - enhanced signal processing technique . the antibunching in the second - order correlation function is clearly observed . the theoretical calculations agree well with the experimental results . such a high - quality single - photon source can be used as a building block of devices for quantum communication , simulations and information processing in the microwave regime .
