we address the standard quantum error correction using the three - qubit bit - flip code , yet in continuous - time . this entails rendering a target manifold of quantum states globally attractive . previous feedback designs could feature spurious equilibria , or resort to discrete kicks pushing the system away from these equilibria to ensure global asymptotic stability . we present a new approach that consists of introducing controls driven by brownian motions . unlike the previous methods , the resulting closed - loop dynamics can be shown to stabilize the target manifold exponentially . we further present a reduced - order filter formulation with classical probabilities . the exponential property is important to quantify the protection induced by the closed - loop error - correction dynamics against disturbances . we study numerically the performance of this control law and of the reduced filter .
