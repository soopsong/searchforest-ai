in this article we investigate aspects of entanglement entropy and mutual information in a large - n strongly coupled noncommutative gauge theory , both at zero and at finite temperature . using the gauge - gravity duality and the ryu - takayanagi ( rt ) prescription , we adopt a scheme for defining spatial regions on such noncommutative geometries and subsequently compute the corresponding entanglement entropy . we observe that for regions which do not lie entirely in the noncommutative plane , the rt - prescription yields sensible results . in order to make sense of the divergence structure of the corresponding entanglement entropy , it is essential to introduce an additional cut - off in the theory . for regions which lie entirely in the noncommutative plane , the corresponding minimal area surfaces can only be defined at this cut - off and they have distinctly peculiar properties .
