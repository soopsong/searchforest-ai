in recent quantum optical continuous - variable experiments , the number of fully inseparable light modes has drastically increased by introducing a multiplexing scheme either in the time domain or in the frequency domain . here , modifying the time - domain multiplexing experiment reported in nature photonics 7 , 982 ( 2013 ) , we demonstrate successive generation of fully inseparable light modes for more than one million modes . the resulting multi - mode state is useful as a dual - rail cv cluster state . we circumvent the previous problem of optical phase drifts , which has limited the number of fully inseparable light modes to around ten thousands , by continuous feedback control of the optical system .
