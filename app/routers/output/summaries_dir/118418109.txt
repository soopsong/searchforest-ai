we study equilibration properties of observables in long - range field theories after the mass quench in $ d=1,2 $ and $ 3 $ dimensions . we classify the regimes where we expect equilibration or its absence in different dimensions . in addition we study the effect of the initial state in the equilibration properties of our system . in the case of free field theories we show that whenever we have equilibration the long - time limit of correlations can be described by the generalized gibbs ensemble . we prove that all integrals of motions in our system are non - local .
