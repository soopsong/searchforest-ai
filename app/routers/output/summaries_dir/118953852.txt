floquet engineering , the control of quantum systems using periodic driving , is an old concept in condensed matter physics , dating back to ideas such as the inverse faraday effect . there is a renewed interest in this concept owing to the rapid developments in laser and ultrafast spectroscopy techniques and discovery and understanding of various"quantum materials"hosting interesting exotic quantum properties . here , starting from a nontechnical introduction with emphasis on the floquet picture and effective hamiltonians , we review the recent applications of floquet engineering in ultrafast , nonlinear phenomena in the solid state . in particular , floquet topological states , application to ultrafast spintronics , and to strongly correlated electron systems are overviewed .
