we investigate the kinetics of a nonrelativistic particle interacting with a constant external force on a lie - algebraic noncommutative space . the structure constants of a lie algebra , also called noncommutative parameters , are constrained in general due to some algebraic properties , such as the antisymmetry and jacobi identity . through solving the constraint equations the structure constants satisfy , we obtain two new sorts of algebraic structures , each of which corresponds to one type of noncommutative spaces . based on such types of noncommutative spaces as the starting point , we analyze the classical motion of the particle interacting with a constant external force by means of the hamiltonian formalism on a poisson manifold . our results { \em not only } include that of a recent work as our special cases , { \em but also } provide new trajectories of motion governed mainly by marvelous extra forces . the extra forces with the unimaginable $ t\dot{x}$- , $ \dot{(xx)}$- , and $ \ddot{(xx)}$-dependence besides with the usual $ t$- , $ x$- , and $ \dot{x}$-dependence , originating from a variety of noncommutativity between different spatial coordinates and between spatial coordinates and momenta as well , deform greatly the particle 's ordinary trajectories we are quite familiar with on the euclidean ( commutative ) space .
