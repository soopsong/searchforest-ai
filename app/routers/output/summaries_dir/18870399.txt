we discuss a method to construct quantum codes correcting amplitude damping errors via code concatenation . the inner codes are chosen as asymmetric calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) codes . by concatenating with outer codes correcting symmetric errors , many new codes with good parameters are found , which are better than the amplitude damping codes obtained by any previously known construction .
