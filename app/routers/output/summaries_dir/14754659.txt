we investigate collective emission from coherently driven ultracold $ ^{88 } $ sr atoms . we perform two sets of experiments , using a strong and weak transition that are insensitive and sensitive , respectively , to atomic motion at one microkelvin . we observe highly directional forward emission with a peak intensity that is enhanced , for the strong transition , by>$ 10 ^3 $ compared to that in the transverse direction . this is accompanied by substantial broadening of spectral lines . for the weak transition , the forward enhancement is substantially reduced due to motion . meanwhile , a density - dependent frequency shift of the weak transition ( ~10 % of the natural linewidth ) is observed . in contrast , this shift is suppressed to<1 % of the natural linewidth for the strong transition . along the transverse direction , we observe strong polarization dependences of the fluorescence intensity and line broadening for both transitions . the measurements are reproduced with a theoretical model treating the atoms as coherent , interacting , radiating dipoles .
