the generation and the characterization of multipartite entangled light is an important and challenging task in quantum optics . in this paper the entanglement properties of the light emitted from a planar semiconductor microcavity are studied . the intracavity scattering dynamics leads to the emission of light that is described by a fourpartite w state . its multipartite correlations are identified by using the method of entanglement witnesses . entanglement conditions are derived , which are based on a general witness constructed from w states . the results can be used to detect entanglement of light that propagates through lossy and even turbulent media .
