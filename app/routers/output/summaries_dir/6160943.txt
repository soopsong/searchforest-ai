molecular vibroic spectroscopy , where the transitions involve non - trivial bosonic correlation due to the duschinsky rotation , is strongly believed to be in a similar complexity class as boson sampling . at finite temperature , the problem is represented as a boson sampling experiment with correlated gaussian input states . this molecular problem with temperature effect is intimately related to the various versions of boson sampling sharing the similar computational complexity . here we provide a full description to this relation in the context of gaussian boson sampling . we find a hierarchical structure , which illustrates the relationship among various boson sampling schemes . specifically , we show that every instance of gaussian boson sampling with an initial correlation can be simulated by an instance of gaussian boson sampling without initial correlation , with only a polynomial overhead . since every gaussian state is associated with a thermal state , our result implies that every sampling problem in molecular vibronic transitions , at any temperature , can be simulated by gaussian boson sampling associated with a product of vacuum modes . we refer such a generalized gaussian boson sampling motivated by the molecular sampling problem as vibronic boson sampling .
