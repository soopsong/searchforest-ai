a feasible , secure and collusion - attack - free quantum sealed - bid auction protocol is proposed using a modified scheme for multi - party circular quantum key agreement . in the proposed protocol , the set of all ( $ n$ ) bidders is grouped in to $ l$ subsets ( sub - circles ) in such a way that only the initiator ( who prepares the quantum state to be distributed for a particular round of communication and acts as the receiver in that round ) is a member of all the subsets ( sub - circles ) prepared for a particular round , while any other bidder is part of only a single subset . all $ n$ bidders and auctioneer initiate one round of communication , and each of them prepares $ l$ copies of a $ \left(r-1\right)$-partite entangled state ( one for each sub - circle ) , where $ r=\frac{n}{l}+1$. the efficiency and security\textcolor{blue } { { } } of the proposed protocol are critically analyzed . it is shown that the proposed protocol is free from the collusion attacks that are possible on the existing schemes of quantum sealed - bid auction . further , it is observed that the security against collusion attack increases with the increase in $ l$ , but that reduces the complexity ( number of entangled qubits in each entangled state ) of the entangled states to be used and that makes the scheme scalable and implementable with the available technologies . the additional security and scalability is shown to arise due to the use of a circular structure in place of a complete - graph or tree - type structure used earlier .
