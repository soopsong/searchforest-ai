we propose an experimentally realizable hybrid quantum circuit for achieving a strong coupling between a spin ensemble and a transmission - line resonator via a superconducting flux qubit used as a data bus . the resulting coupling can be used to transfer quantum information between the spin ensemble and the resonator . in particular , in contrast to the direct coupling without a data bus , our approach requires far less spins to achieve a strong coupling between the spin ensemble and the resonator ( e.g. , three to four orders of magnitude less ) . this proposed hybrid quantum circuit could enable a long - time quantum memory when storing information in the spin ensemble , and allows the possibility to explore nonlinear effects in the ultrastrong - coupling regime .
