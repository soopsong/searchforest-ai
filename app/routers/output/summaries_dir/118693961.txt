we investigate quantum repeater protocols based upon atomic qubit - entanglement distribution through optical coherent - state communication . various measurement schemes for an optical mode entangled with two spatially separated atomic qubits are considered in order to nonlocally prepare conditional two - qubit entangled states . in particular , generalized measurements for unambiguous state discrimination enable one to completely eliminate spin - flip errors in the resulting qubit states , as they would occur in a homodyne - based scheme due to the finite overlap of the optical states in phase space . as a result , by using weaker coherent states , high initial fidelities can still be achieved for larger repeater spacing , at the expense of lower entanglement generation rates . in this regime , the coherent - state - based protocols start resembling single - photon - based repeater schemes .
