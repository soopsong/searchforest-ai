we present an efficient entanglement purification protocol with hyperentanglement in which additional spatial entanglement is utilized to purify the two - particle polarization - entangled state . the bit - flip error and phase - flip error can be corrected and eliminated in one step . two remote parties can obtainmaximally entangled polarization states deterministically and only passive linear optics are employed . we also discuss the protocol with practical quantum source and noisy channel .
