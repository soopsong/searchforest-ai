a new entangled quantum state is introduced by applying local coherent superposition ( ra^+ + ta ) of photon subtraction and addition to each mode of even entangled coherent state ( eecs ) and the properties of entanglement are investigated . it is found that the shchukin - vogel inseparability , the degree of entanglement and the average fidelity of quantum teleportation of the eecs can be improved due to the coherent superposition operation . the effects of improvement by coherent superposition operation are better than those by single ( a^+ ) and two - photon ( a^+ b^+ ) addition operations under a small region of amplitude .
