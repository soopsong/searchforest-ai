we study two - charge fuzzball geometries , with attention to the use of the proper duality frame . for zero angular momentum there is an onion - like structure , and the smooth d1-d5 geometries are not valid for typical states . rather , they are best approximated by geometries with stringy sources , or by a free cft . for non - zero angular momentum we find a regime where smooth fuzzball solutions are the correct description . our analysis rests on the comparison of three radii : the typical fuzzball radius , the entropy radius determined by the microscopic theory , and the breakdown radius where the curvature becomes large . we attempt to draw more general lessons .
