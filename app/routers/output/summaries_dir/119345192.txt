we introduce a method to determine whether a given generalised quantum measurement is isolated or it belongs to a family of measurements having the same prescribed symmetry . the technique proposed reduces to solving a linear system of equations in some relevant cases . as consequence , we provide a simple derivation of the maximal family of symmetric informationally complete measurements ( sic)-povm in dimension 3 . furthermore , we show that the following remarkable geometrical structures are isolated , so that free parameters can not be introduced : ( a ) maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases in prime power dimensions from 4 to 16 , ( b ) sic - povm in dimensions from 4 to 16 and ( c ) contextuality kochen - specker sets in dimension 3 , 4 and 6 , composed of 13 , 18 and 21 vectors , respectively .
