we investigate structural resonances in multi - element optical resonators and provide a roadmap for the description of the interaction of single extended cavity modes with quantum emitters or mechanical resonators . using a first principle approach based on the transfer matrix formalism we analyze , both numerically and analytically , the static and dynamical properties of three- and four - mirror cavities . we investigate in particular conditions under which the confinement of the field in specific subcavities allows for enhanced light - matter interactions in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics and cavity optomechanics .
