machine learning techniques based on artificial neural networks have been successfully applied to solve many problems in science . one of the most interesting domains of machine learning , reinforcement learning , has natural applicability for optimization problems in physics . in this work we use deep reinforcement learning and chopped random basis optimization , to solve an optimization problem based on the insertion of an off - center barrier in a quantum szilard engine . we show that using designed protocols for the time dependence of the barrier strength , we can achieve an equal splitting of the wave function ( 1/2 probability to find the particle on either side of the barrier ) even for an asymmetric szilard engine in such a way that no information is lost when measuring which side the particle is found . this implies that the asymmetric non - adiabatic szilard engine can operate with the same efficiency as the traditional szilard engine , with adiabatic insertion of a central barrier . we compare the two optimization methods , and demonstrate the advantage of reinforcement learning when it comes to constructing robust and noise - resistant protocols .
