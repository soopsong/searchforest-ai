we theoretically study a circuit qed architecture based on a superconducting flux qubit directly coupled to the center conductor of a coplanar waveguide transmission - line resonator . as already shown experimentally [ abdumalikov et al . phys . rev . b 78 , 180502 ( 2008 ) ] , the strong coupling regime of cavity qed can readily be achieved by optimizing the local inductance of the resonator in the vicinity of the qubit . in addition to yielding stronger coupling with respect to other proposals for flux qubit based circuit qed , this approach leads to a qubit - resonator coupling strength g which does not scale as the area of the qubit but is proportional to the total inductance shared between the resonator and the qubit . strong coupling can thus be attained while still minimizing sensitivity to flux noise . finally , we show that by taking advantage of the the large kinetic inductance of a josephson junction in the center conductor of the resonator can lead to coupling energies of several tens of percent of the resonator frequency , reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime of cavity qed where the rotating - wave approximation breaks down . this should allow an on - chip implementation of the e x b jahn - teller model .
