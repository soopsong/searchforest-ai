micro - optomechanical systems are central to a number of recent proposals for realizing quantum mechanical effects in relatively massive systems . here we focus on a particular class of experiments which aim to demonstrate massive quantum superpositions , although the obtained results should be generalizable to similar experiments . we analyze in detail the effects of finite temperature on the interpretation of the experiment , and obtain a lower bound on the degree of non - classicality of the cantilever . although it is possible to measure the quantum decoherence time when starting from finite temperature , an unambiguous demonstration of a quantum superposition requires the mechanical resonator to be in or near the ground state . this can be achieved by optical cooling of the fundamental mode , which also provides a method to measure the mean phonon number in that mode . we also calculate the rate of environmentally induced decoherence and estimate the timescale for gravitational collapse mechanisms as proposed by penrose and diosi . in view of recent experimental advances , practical considerations for the realization of the described experiment are discussed .
