we apply the full power of modern electronic band structure engineering and epitaxial heterostructures to design a transistor that can sense and control a single donor electron spin . spin resonance transistors may form the technological basis for quantum information processing . one and two qubit operations are performed by applying a gate bias . the bias electric field pulls the electron wave function away from the dopant ion into layers of different alloy composition . owing to the variation of the g - factor ( si : g=1.995 , ge : g=1.563 ) , this displacement changes the spin zeeman energy , allowing single - qubit operations . by displacing the electron even further , the overlap with neighboring qubits is affected , which allows two - qubit operations . certain silicon - germanium alloys allow a qubit spacing as large as 200 nm , which is well within the capabilities of current lithographic techniques . we discuss manufacturing limitations and issues regarding scaling up to a large size computer .
