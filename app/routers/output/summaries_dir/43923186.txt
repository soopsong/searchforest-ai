it is an intriguing concept to use oscillators as fundamental building blocks of electronic computers . the idea is not new , but is currently subject to intense research as a part of the quest for ' beyond moore ' electronic devices . in this paper we give an engineering - minded survey of oscillator - based computing architectures , with the goal of understanding their promise and limitations for next - generation computing . we will mostly discuss non - boolean , neurally - inspired computing concepts and put the emphasis on hardware and on circuits where the oscillators are realized from emerging , nanoscale building blocks . despite all the promise that oscillatory computing holds , existing literature gives very few clear - cut arguments about the possible benefits of using oscillators in place of other analog nonlinear circuit elements . in this survey we will argue for finding the rationale of using oscillatory building blocks and call for benchmarking studies that compare oscillatory computing circuits to level - based ( analog ) implementations .
