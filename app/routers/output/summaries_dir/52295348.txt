we investigate two - copy scenario of quantum teleportation based on bell measurements . the detailed protocol is presented and the general expression of the corresponding optimal teleportation delity is derived , which is given by the two - copy fully entangled fraction that is invariant under local unitary transformations . we prove that under a speci c case of the protocol , which is signi ca nt for improving the optimal delity , the set of states with their two - copy fully entangled fractions bounded by a threshold value that required for useful two - copy teleportation is convex and compact . hence the witness operators exist to separate states that are useful for two - copy teleportation from the rest ones . moreover , we show that the optimal delity of two - copy teleportation surpasses that of the original one copy teleportation .
