we design linear optics multiqubit quantum logic gates . we assume the traditional encoding of a qubit onto state of a single photon in two modes ( e.g. spatial or polarization ) . we suggest schemes allowing direct probabilistic realization of the fundamental toffoli and fredkin gates without resorting to a sequence of single- and two - qubit gates . this yields more compact schemes and potentially reduces the number of ancilla photons . the proposed setups involve passive linear optics , sources of auxiliary single photons or maximally entangled pairs of photons , and single - photon detectors . in particular , we propose an interferometric implementation of the toffoli gate in the coincidence basis , which does not require any ancilla photons and is experimentally feasible with current technology .
