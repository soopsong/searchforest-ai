localizability of entanglement in fully inseparable states is a key ingredient of assisted quantum information protocols as well as measurement - based models of quantum computing . we investigate the existence of fully inseparable states with nonlocalizable entanglement , that is , with entanglement which can not be localized between any pair of subsystems by any measurement on the remaining part of the system . it is shown , that the nonlocalizable entanglement occurs already in suitable mixtures of a three - qubit ghz state and white noise . further , we generalize this set of states to a two - parametric family of fully inseparable three - qubit states with nonlocalizable entanglement . finally , we demonstrate experimentally the existence of nonlocalizable entanglement by preparing and characterizing one state from the family using correlated single photons and linear optical circuit .
