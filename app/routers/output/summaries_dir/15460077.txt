a new derivation of quantum stochastic differential equation for the evolution operator in the low density limit is presented . we use the distribution approach and derive a new algebra for quadratic master fields in the low density limit by using the energy representation . we formulate the stochastic golden rule in the low density limit case for a system coupling with bose field via quadratic interaction . in particular the vacuum expectation value of the evolution operator is computed and its exponential decay is shown .
