we study propagation of entanglement after a mass quench in free scalar lifshitz theories . we show that entanglement entropy goes across three distinct growth regimes before relaxing to a generalized gibbs ensemble , namely ' initial rapid growth ' , ' main linear growth ' and ' tortoise saturation ' . we show that although a wide spectrum of quasi - particles are responsible for entanglement propagation , as long as the occupation number of the zero mode is not divergent , the linear main growth regime is dominated by the fastest quasi - particle propagating on the edges of a widen light - cone . we present strong evidences in support of effective causality and therefore define an effective notion of saturation time in these theories . the larger the dynamical exponent is , the shorter the linear main growth regime becomes . due to a pile of tortoise modes which become dominant after saturation of fast modes , exact saturation time is postponed to infinity .
