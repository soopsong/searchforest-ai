the paper is concerned with the coherent quantum linear quadratic gaussian ( cqlqg ) control problem for time - varying quantum plants governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations over a bounded time interval . a controller is sought among quantum linear systems satisfying physical realizability ( pr ) conditions . the latter describe the dynamic equivalence of the system to an open quantum harmonic oscillator and relate its state - space matrices to the free hamiltonian , coupling and scattering operators of the oscillator . using the hamiltonian parameterization of pr controllers , the cqlqg problem is recast into an optimal control problem for a deterministic system governed by a differential lyapunov equation . the state of this subsidiary system is the symmetric part of the quantum covariance matrix of the plant - controller state vector . the resulting covariance control problem is treated using dynamic programming and pontryagin 's minimum principle . the associated hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation for the minimum cost function involves frechet differentiation with respect to matrix - valued variables . the gain matrices of the cqlqg optimal controller are shown to satisfy a quasi - separation property as a weaker quantum counterpart of the filtering / control decomposition of classical lqg controllers .
