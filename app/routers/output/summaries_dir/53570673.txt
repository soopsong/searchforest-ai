we present a framework for modeling superconducting circuits that integrates classical microwave analysis with circuit quantization . our framework enables the calculation of the lossy eigenmodes of superconducting circuits , and we demonstrate the method by analyzing several circuits relevant to multiplexed , purcell filtered transmon readout architectures . we show that the transmon relaxation times obtained by our method agree with the established approximation $ t_1 \approx c/\text{re}[y(i\omega_q)]$ away from environmental resonances and do not vanish on resonance . we also show that the hybridization of the modes in the readout circuit is highly sensitive to the bandwidth of the purcell filter .
