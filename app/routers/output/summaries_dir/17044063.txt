optimal control theory is a powerful tool for improving figures of merit in quantum information tasks . finding the solution to any optimal control problem via numerical optimization depends crucially on the choice of the optimization functional . here , we derive a functional that targets the full set of two - qubit perfect entanglers , gates capable of creating a maximally - entangled state out of some initial product state . the functional depends on easily - computable local invariants and uniquely determines when a gate evolves into a perfect entangler . optimization with our functional is most useful if the two - qubit dynamics allows for the implementation of more than one perfect entangler . we discuss the reachable set of perfect entanglers for a generic hamiltonian that corresponds to several quantum information platforms of current interest .
