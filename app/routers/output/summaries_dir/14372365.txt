we describe a new approach for on - chip optical non - reciprocity which makes use of strong optomechanical interaction in microring resonators . by optically pumping the ring resonator in one direction , the optomechanical coupling is only enhanced in that direction , and consequently , the system exhibits a non - reciprocal response . for different configurations , this system can function either as an optical isolator or a coherent non - reciprocal phase shifter . we show that the operation of such a device on the level of single - photon could be achieved with existing technology .
