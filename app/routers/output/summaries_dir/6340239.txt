we introduce a computational problem of distinguishing between two specific quantum states as a new cryptographic problem to design a quantum cryptographic scheme that is"secure"against any polynomial - time quantum adversary . our problem , qscdff , is to distinguish between two types of random coset states with a hidden permutation over the symmetric group of finite degree . this naturally generalizes the commonly - used distinction problem between two probability distributions in computational cryptography . as our major contribution , we show that qscdff has three properties of cryptographic interest : ( i ) qscdff has a trapdoor ; ( ii ) the average - case hardness of qscdff coincides with its worst - case hardness ; and ( iii ) qscdff is computationally at least as hard as the graph automorphism problem in the worst case . these cryptographic properties enable us to construct a quantum public - key cryptosystem , which is likely to withstand any chosen plaintext attack of a polynomial - time quantum adversary . we further discuss a generalization of qscdff , called qscdcyc , and introduce a multi - bit encryption scheme that relies on similar cryptographic properties of qscdcyc .
