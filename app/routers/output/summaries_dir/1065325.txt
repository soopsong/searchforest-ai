we derive the explicit analytical form of the time - dependent coupling parameter to an external field for perfect absorption of traveling single photon fields with arbitrary temporal profiles by a tunable single input - output open quantum system , which can be realized as either a single qubit or single resonator system . however , the time - dependent coupling parameter for perfect absorption has a singularity at $ t=0 $ and constraints on real systems prohibit a faithful physical realization of the perfect absorber . a numerical example is included to illustrate the absorber 's performance under practical limitations on the coupling strength .
