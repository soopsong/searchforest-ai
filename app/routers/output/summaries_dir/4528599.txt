we study the energy level crossing behavior in two - dimensional quantum well with the rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit couplings ( socs ) . by mapping the soc hamiltonian onto an anisotropic rabi model , we obtain the approximate ground state and its quantum fisher information ( qfi ) via performing a unitary transformation . we find that the energy level crossing can occur in the quantum well system within the available parameters rather than in cavity and circuit quantum eletrodynamics systems . futhermore , the influence of two kinds of socs on the qfi is investigated and an intuitive explanation from the viewpoint of the stationary perturbation theory is given .
