quantum trajectory methods can be used for a wide range of open quantum systems to solve the master equation by unraveling the density operator evolution into individual stochastic trajectories in hilbert space . this c++ class library offers a choice of integration algorithms for three important unravelings of the master equation . different physical systems are modeled by different hamiltonians and environment operators . the program achieves flexibility and user friendliness , without sacrificing execution speed , through the way it represents operators and states in hilbert space . primary operators , implemented in the form of simple routines acting on single degrees of freedom , can be used to build up arbitrarily complex operators in product hilbert spaces with arbitrary numbers of components . standard algebraic notation is used to build operators and to perform arithmetic operations on operators and states . states can be represented in a local moving basis , often leading to dramatic savings of computing resources . the state and operator classes are very general and can be used independently of the quantum trajectory algorithms . only a rudimentary knowledge of c++ is required to use this package .
