satellite - based quantum communications enable a bright future for global - scale information security . however , the spin orbital momentum of light , currently used in many mainstream quantum communication systems , only allows for quantum encoding in a two - dimensional hilbert space . the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of light , on the other hand , enables quantum encoding in higher - dimensional hilbert spaces , opening up new opportunities for high - capacity quantum communications . due to its turbulence - induced decoherence effects , however , the atmospheric channel may limit the practical usage of oam . in order to determine whether oam is useful for satellite - based quantum communications , we numerically investigate the detection likelihoods for oam states that traverse satellite - to - ground channels . we show that the use of oam through such channels is in fact feasible . we use our new results to then investigate design specifications that could improve oam detection - particularly the use of advanced adaptive optics techniques . finally , we discuss how our work provides new insights into future implementations of space - based oam systems within the context of quantum communications .
