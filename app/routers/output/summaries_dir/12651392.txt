superconducting microwave resonators are reliable circuits widely used for detection and as test devices for material research . a reliable determination of their external and internal quality factors is crucial for many modern applications , which either require fast measurements or operate in the single photon regime with small signal to noise ratios . here , we use the circle fit technique with diameter correction and provide a step by step guide for implementing an algorithm for robust fitting and calibration of complex resonator scattering data in the presence of noise . the speedup and robustness of the analysis are achieved by employing an algebraic rather than an iterative fit technique for the resonance circle .
