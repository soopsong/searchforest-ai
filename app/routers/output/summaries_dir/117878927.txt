recent work has shown how to use the laws of quantum mechanics to keep classical and quantum bits secret in a number of different circumstances . among the examples are private quantum channels , quantum secret sharing and quantum data hiding . in this paper we show that a method for keeping two classical bits hidden in any such scenario can be used to construct a method for keeping one quantum bit hidden , and vice -- versa . in the realm of quantum data hiding , this allows us to construct bipartite and multipartite hiding schemes for qubits from the previously known constructions for hiding bits . our method also gives a simple proof that two bits of shared randomness are required to construct a private quantum channel hiding one qubit .
