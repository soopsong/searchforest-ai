besides the conventional transverse couplings between superconducting qubits ( sqs ) and electromagnetic fields , there are additional longitudinal couplings when the inversion symmetry of the potential energies of the sqs is broken . we study nonclassical - state generation in a sq which is driven by a classical field and coupled to a single - mode microwave field . we find that the classical field can induce transitions between two energy levels of the sqs , which either generate or annihilate , in a controllable way , different photon numbers of the cavity field . the effective hamiltonians of these classical - field - assisted multiphoton processes of the single - mode cavity field are very similar to those for cold ions , confined to a coaxial rf - ion trap and driven by a classical field . we show that arbitrary superpositions of fock states can be more efficiently generated using these controllable multiphoton transitions , in contrast to the single - photon resonant transition when there is only a sq - field transverse coupling . the experimental feasibility for different sqs is also discussed .
