we address quantum estimation of displacement and squeezing parameters by the class of probes made of gaussian states undergoing kerr interaction . if we fix the overall energy available to the probe , without posing any constraint on the available gaussian squeezing , then gaussian squeezing represents the optimal resource for parameter estimation . on the other hand , in the more realistic case where the amount of gaussian squeezing is fixed , or even absent , then kerr interaction turns out to be useful to improve estimation , especially for probe states with large amplitude . our results indicate that precision achievable with current technology gaussian squeezing may be attained and surpassed for realistic values of the kerr coupling .
