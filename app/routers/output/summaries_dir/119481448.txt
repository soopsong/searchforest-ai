we describe an electrodynamic mechanism for coherent , quantum mechanical coupling between spacially separated quantum dots on a microchip . the technique is based on capacitive interactions between the electron charge and a superconducting transmission line resonator , and is closely related to atomic cavity quantum electrodynamics . we investigate several potential applications of this technique which have varying degrees of complexity . in particular , we demonstrate that this mechanism allows design and investigation of an on - chip double - dot microscopic maser . moreover , the interaction may be extended to couple spatially separated electron spin states while only virtually populating fast - decaying superpositions of charge states . this represents an effective , controllable long - range interaction , which may facilitate implementation of quantum information processing with electron spin qubits and potentially allow coupling to other quantum systems such as atomic or superconducting qubits .
