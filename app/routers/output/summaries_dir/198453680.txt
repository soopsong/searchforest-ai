sources of pure and indistinguishable single - photons are critical for near - future optical quantum technologies . recently , color centers hosted by two - dimensional hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) have emerged as a promising platform for high luminosity room temperature single - photon sources . despite the brightness of the emitters , the spectrum is rather broad and the single - photon purity is not sufficient for practical quantum information processing . here , we report integration of such a quantum emitter hosted by hbn into a tunable optical microcavity . a small mode volume of the order of $ \lambda^3 $ allows us to purcell enhance the fluorescence , with the observed excited state lifetime shortening . the cavity significantly narrows the spectrum and improves the single - photon purity by suppression of off - resonant noise . we explore practical applications by evaluating the performance of our single - photon source for quantum key distribution and quantum computing . the complete device is compact and implemented on a picoclass satellite platform , enabling future low - cost satellite - based long - distance quantum networks .
