the measurement range problem , where one can not determine the data outside the range of the detector , limits the characterization of entanglement in high - dimensional quantum systems when employing , among other tools from information theory , the entropic uncertainty relations . practically , the measurement range problem weakens the security of entanglement - based large - alphabet quantum key distribution ( qkd ) employing degrees of freedom including time - frequency or electric field quadrature . we present a modified entropic uncertainty relation that circumvents the measurement range problem under certain conditions , and apply it to well - known qkd protocols . for time - frequency qkd , although our bound is an improvement , we find that high channel loss poses a problem for its feasibility . in continuous variable qkd , we find our bound provides a quantitative way to monitor for saturation attacks .
