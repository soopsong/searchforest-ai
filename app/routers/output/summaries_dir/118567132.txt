we propose a quantitative criterion to determine whether the coupled quantum systems can achieve complete synchronization or phase synchronization in the process of analyzing quantum synchronization . adopting the criterion , we discuss the quantum synchronization effects between optomechanical systems and find that the error between the systems and the fluctuation of error are sensitive to coupling intensity by calculating the largest lyapunov exponent of the model and quantum fluctuation , respectively . through taking the appropriate coupling intensity , we can control quantum synchronization even under different logical relationship between switches . finally , we simulate the dynamical evolution of the system to verify the quantum synchronization criterion and to show the ability of synchronization control .
