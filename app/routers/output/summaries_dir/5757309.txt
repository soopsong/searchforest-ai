we analyze the asymptotic behavior of discrete - time , markovian quantum systems with respect to a subspace of interest . global asymptotic stability of subspaces is relevant to quantum information processing , in particular for initializing the system in pure states or subspace codes . we provide a linear - algebraic characterization of the dynamical properties leading to invariance and attractivity of a given quantum subspace . we then construct a design algorithm for discrete - time feedback control that allows to stabilize a target subspace , proving that if the control problem is feasible , then the algorithm returns an effective control choice . in order to prove this result , a canonical qr matrix decomposition is derived , and also used to establish the control scheme potential for the simulation of open - system dynamics .
