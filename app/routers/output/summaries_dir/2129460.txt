thermal noise of a mirror can be reduced by cold damping . the displacement is measured with a high - finesse cavity and controlled with the radiation pressure of a modulated light beam . we establish the general quantum limits of noise in cold damping mechanisms and we show that the optomechanical system allows to reach these limits . displacement noise can be arbitrarily reduced in a narrow frequency band . in a wide - band analysis we show that thermal fluctuations are reduced as with classical damping whereas quantum zero - point fluctuations are left unchanged . the only limit of cold damping is then due to zero - point energy of the mirror
