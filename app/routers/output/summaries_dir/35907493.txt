we consider the quantum mechanical transport of ( coherent ) excitons on small - world networks ( swn ) . the swn are build from a one - dimensional ring of n nodes by randomly introducing b additional bonds between them . the exciton dynamics is modeled by continuous - time quantum walks and we evaluate numerically the ensemble averaged transition probability to reach any node of the network from the initially excited one . for sufficiently large b we find that the quantum mechanical transport through the swn is , first , very fast , given that the limiting value of the transition probability is reached very quickly ; second , that the transport does not lead to equipartition , given that on average the exciton is most likely to be found at the initial node .
