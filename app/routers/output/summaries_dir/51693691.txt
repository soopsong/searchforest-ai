we suggest a method to reconstruct the zero - delay - time second - order correlation function $ g^{(2)}(0)$ of gaussian states using a single homodyne detector . to this purpose , we have found an analytic expression of $ g^{(2)}(0)$ for single- and two - mode gaussian states in terms of the elements of their covariance matrix and the displacement amplitude . in the single - mode case we demonstrate our scheme experimentally , and also show that when the input state is nonclassical , there exist a threshold value of the coherent amplitude , and a range of values of the complex squeezing parameter , above which $ g^{(2)}(0)<1$. for amplitude squeezing and real coherent amplitude , the threshold turns out to be a necessary and sufficient condition for the nonclassicality of the state . analogous results hold also for two - mode squeezed thermal states .
