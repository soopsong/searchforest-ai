the role of permutation gates for universal quantum computing is investigated . the \lq magic ' of computation is clarified in the permutation gates , their eigenstates , the wootters discrete wigner function and state - dependent contextuality ( following many contributions on this subject ) . a first classification of main types of resulting magic states in low dimensions $ d \le 9 $ is performed .
