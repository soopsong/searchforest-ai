the n - queens problem is to find the position of n queens on an n by n chess board such that no queens attack each other . the excluded diagonals n - queens problem is a variation where queens can not be placed on some predefined fields along diagonals . this variation is proven np - complete and the parameter regime to generate hard instances that are intractable with current classical algorithms is known . we propose a special purpose quantum simulator that implements the excluded diagonals n - queens completion problem using atoms in an optical lattice and cavity - mediated long - range interactions . our implementation has no overhead from the embedding allowing to directly probe for a possible quantum advantage in near term devices for optimization problems .
