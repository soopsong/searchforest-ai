we demonstrate a quantum key distribution ( qkd ) testbed for room temperature single photon sources based on defect centres in diamond . a bb84 protocol over a short free - space transmission line is implemented . the performance of nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) as well as silicon - vacancy defect ( siv ) centres is evaluated and an extrapolation for next - generation sources with enhanced efficiency is discussed .
