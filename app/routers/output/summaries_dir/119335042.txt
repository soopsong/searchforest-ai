we consider the tonks - girardeau gas subject to a random external potential . if the disorder is such that the underlying one - particle hamiltonian displays localization ( which is known to be generically the case ) , we show that there is exponential decay of correlations in the many - body eigenstates . moreover , there is no bose - einstein condensation and no superfluidity , even at zero temperature .
