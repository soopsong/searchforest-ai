we study how photon addition and subtraction can be used to generate squeezed superpositions of coherent states in free - traveling fields ( sscss ) with high fidelities and large amplitudes . it is shown that an arbitrary $ n$-photon subtraction results in the generation of a sscs with nearly the perfect fidelity ( $ f>0.999 $ ) regardless of the number of photons subtracted . in this case , the amplitude of the sscs increases as the number of the subtracted photons gets larger . for example , two - photon subtraction from a squeezed vacuum state of 6.1db can generate a sscs of $ \alpha=1.26 $ , while in the case of the four - photon subtraction a sscs of a larger amplitude $ \alpha=1.65 $ is obtained under the same condition . when a photon is subtracted from a squeezed vacuum state and another photon is added subsequently , a sscs with a lower fidelity ( $ f\approx 0.96 $ ) yet higher amplitude ( $ \alpha\approx2 $ ) can be generated . we analyze some experimental imperfections including inefficiency of the detector used for the photon subtraction .
