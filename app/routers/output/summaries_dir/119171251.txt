we adopt the concept of the composite parameterization of the unitary group u(d ) to the special unitary group su(d ) . furthermore , we also consider the haar measure in terms of the introduced parameters . we show that the well - defined structure of the parameterization leads to a concise formula for the normalized haar measure on u(d ) and su(d ) . with regard to possible applications of our results , we consider the computation of high - order integrals over unitary groups .
