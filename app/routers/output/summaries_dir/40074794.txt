we prove upper and lower bounds relating the quantum gate complexity of a unitary operation , u , to the optimal control cost associated to the synthesis of u. these bounds apply for any optimal control problem , and can be used to show that the quantum gate complexity is essentially equivalent to the optimal control cost for a wide range of problems , including time - optimal control and finding minimal distances on certain riemannian , subriemannian , and finslerian manifolds . these results generalize the results of nielsen , dowling , gu , and doherty , science 311 , 1133 - 1135 ( 2006 ) , which showed that the gate complexity can be related to distances on a riemannian manifold
