we investigate the relation between cartan decompositions of the unitary group and discrete quantum symmetries . to every cartan decomposition there corresponds a quantum symmetry which is the identity when applied twice . as an application , we describe a new and general method to obtain cartan decompositions of the unitary group of evolutions of multipartite systems from cartan decompositions on the single subsystems . the resulting decomposition , which we call of the odd - even type , contains , as a special case , the concurrence canonical decomposition ( ccd ) presented in the context of entanglement theory . the ccd is therefore extended from the case of a multipartite system of n qubits to the case where the component subsystems have arbitrary dimension .
