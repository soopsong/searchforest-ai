measurement is integral to quantum information processing and communication ; it is how information encoded in the state of a system is transformed into classical signals for further use . in quantum optics , measurements are typically destructive , so that the state is not available afterwards for further steps - crucial for sequential measurement schemes . the development of practical methods for non - destructive measurements on optical fields is therefore an important topic for future practical quantum information processing systems . here we show how to measure the presence or absence of the vacuum in a quantum optical field without destroying the state , implementing the ideal projections onto the respective subspaces . this not only enables sequential measurements , useful for quantum communication , but it can also be adapted to create novel states of light via bare raising and lowering operators .
