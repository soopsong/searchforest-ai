hyperentanglement , defined as the entanglement in several degrees of freedom ( dofs ) of a quantum system , has attracted much attention recently . here we investigate the possibility of concentrating the two - photon four - qubit systems in partially hyperentangled states in both the spatial mode and the polarization dofs with linear optics . we first introduce our parameter - splitting method to concentrate the systems in the partially hyperentangled states with known parameters , including partially hyperentangled bell states and cluster states . subsequently , we present another two nonlocal hyperentanglement concentration protocols ( hyper - ecps ) for the systems in partially hyperentangled unknown states , resorting to the schmidt projection method . it will be shown that our parameter - splitting method is very efficient for the concentration of the quantum systems in partially entangled states with known parameters , resorting to linear - optical elements only . all these four hyper - ecps are feasible with current technology and they may be useful in long - distance quantum communication based on hyperentanglement as they require only linear optical elements .
