we consider two - way continuous - variable quantum key distribution , studying its security against general eavesdropping strategies . assuming the asymptotic limit of many signals exchanged , we prove that two - way gaussian protocols are immune to coherent attacks . more precisely we show the general superadditivity of the two - way security thresholds , which are proven to be higher than the corresponding one - way counterparts in all cases . we perform the security analysis first reducing the general eavesdropping to a two - mode coherent gaussian attack , and then showing that the superadditivity is achieved by exploiting the random on / off switching of the two - way quantum communication . this allows the parties to choose the appropriate communication instances to prepare the key , accordingly to the tomography of the quantum channel . the random opening and closing of the circuit represents , in fact , an additional degree of freedom allowing the parties to convert , a posteriori , the two - mode correlations of the eavesdropping into noise . the eavesdropper is assumed to have no access to the on / off switching and , indeed , can not adapt her attack . we explicitly prove that this mechanism enhances the security performance , no matter if the eavesdropper performs collective or coherent attacks .
