brillouin scattering is not usually considered as a mechanism that can cause cooling of a material due to the thermodynamic dominance of stokes scattering in most practical systems . however , it has been shown in experiments on resonators that net phonon annihilation through anti - stokes brillouin scattering can be enabled by means of a suitable set of optical and acoustic states . the cooling of traveling phonons in a linear waveguide , on the other hand , could lead to the exciting future prospect of manipulating unidirectional phonon fluxes and even the nonreciprocal transport of quantum information via phonons . in this work , we present an analysis of the conditions under which brillouin cooling of phonons of both low and high group velocities may be achieved in a linear waveguide . we analyze the three - wave mixing interaction between the optical and traveling acoustic modes that participate in forward brillouin scattering , and reveal the key regimes of operation for the process . our calculations indicate that measurable cooling may occur in a system having phonons with spatial loss rate that is of the same order as the spatial optical loss rate . if the brillouin gain in such a waveguide reaches the order of 10$^{5}$ m$^{-1}$w$^{-1}$ , appreciable cooling of phonon modes may be observed with modest pump power of a few mw .
