nitrogen vacancy ( nv ) centers can couple to confined phonons in diamond mechanical resonators via the effect of lattice strain on their energy levels . access to the strong spin - phonon coupling regime with this system requires resonators with nanoscale dimensions in order to overcome the weak strain response of the nv ground state spin sublevels . in this work , we study nvs in diamond cantilevers with lateral dimensions of a few hundred nm . coupling of the nv ground state spin to the mechanical mode is detected in electron spin resonance ( esr ) , and its temporal dynamics are measured via spin echo . our small mechanical mode volume leads to a 10 - 100x enhancement in spin - phonon coupling strength over previous nv - strain coupling demonstrations . this is an important step towards strong spin - phonon coupling , which can enable phonon - mediated quantum information processing and quantum metrology .
