we perform randomized benchmarking on neutral atomic quantum bits ( qubits ) confined in an optical lattice . single qubit gates are implemented using microwaves , resulting in a measured error per randomized computational gate of 1.4(1 ) x 10 ^ -4 that is dominated by the system t2 relaxation time . the results demonstrate the robustness of the system , and its viability for more advanced quantum information protocols .
