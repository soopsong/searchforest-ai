quantum process tomography is a procedure by which the unknown dynamical evolution of an open quantum system can be fully experimentally characterized . we demonstrate explicitly how this procedure can be implemented with a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer . this allows us to measure the fidelity of a controlled - not logic gate and to experimentally investigate the error model for our computer . based on the latter analysis , we test an important assumption underlying nearly all models of quantum error correction , the independence of errors on different qubits .
