we reveal a generic connection between the effect of time - reversals and nonlinear wave dynamics in systems with parity - time ( pt ) symmetry , considering a symmetric optical coupler with balanced gain and loss where these effects can be readily observed experimentally . we show that for intensities below a threshold level , the amplitudes oscillate between the waveguides , and the effects of gain and loss are exactly compensated after each period due to { periodic time - reversals } . for intensities above a threshold level , nonlinearity suppresses periodic time - reversals leading to the symmetry breaking and a sharp beam switching to the waveguide with gain . another nontrivial consequence of linear pt - symmetry is that the threshold intensity remains the same when the input intensities at waveguides with loss and gain are exchanged .
