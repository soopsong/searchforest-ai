strong dipole - exchange interactions due to spontaneously produced contaminant states can trigger rapid dephasing in many - body rydberg ensembles [ e. goldschmidt et al . , prl 116 , 113001 ( 2016 ) ] . such broadening has serious implications for many proposals to coherently use rydberg interactions , particularly rydberg dressing proposals . the dephasing arises as a runaway process where the production of the first contaminant atoms facilitates the creation of more contaminant atoms . here we study the time dependence of this process with stroboscopic approaches . using a pump - probe technique , we create an excess"pump"rydberg population and probe its effect with a different"probe"rydberg transition . we observe a reduced resonant pumping rate and an enhancement of the excitation on both sides of the transition as atoms are added to the pump state . we also observe a timescale for population growth significantly shorter than predicted by homogeneous mean - field models , as expected from a clustered growth mechanism where high - order correlations dominate the dynamics . these results support earlier works and confirm that the time scale for the onset of dephasing is reduced by a factor which scales as the inverse of the atom number . in addition , we discuss several approaches to minimize these effects of spontaneous broadening , including stroboscopic techniques and operating at cryogenic temperatures . it is challenging to avoid the unwanted broadening effects , but under some conditions they can be mitigated .
