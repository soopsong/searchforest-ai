einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) steering describes how different ensembles of quantum states can be remotely prepared by measuring one particle of an entangled pair . here , we investigate quantum steering for single quantum d - dimensional systems ( qudits ) and devise efficient conditions to certify the steerability therein , which are applicable both to single - system steering and epr steering . in the single - system case our steering conditions enable the unambiguous ruling - out of generic classical means of mimicking steering . ruling out false - steering scenarios has implications for securing channels against both cloning - based individual attack and coherent attacks when implementing quantum key distribution using qudits . we also show that these steering conditions also have applications in quantum computation , in that they can serve as an efficient criterion for the evaluation of quantum logic gates of arbitrary size . finally , we describe how the non - local epr variant of these conditions also function as tools for identifying faithful one - way quantum computation , secure entanglement - based quantum communication , and genuine multipartite epr steering .
