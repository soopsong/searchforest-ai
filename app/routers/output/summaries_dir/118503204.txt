we propose a scheme to investigate whether non - uniform motion degrades entanglement of a relativistic quantum field that is localised both in space and in time . for a dirichlet scalar field in a cavity in minkowski space , in small but freely - adjustable acceleration of finite but arbitrarily long duration , degradation of observable magnitude occurs for massless transverse quanta of optical wavelength at earth gravity acceleration and for kaon mass quanta already at microgravity acceleration . we outline a space - based experiment for observing the effect and its gravitational counterpart .
