the majority of linear - optical nondestructive implementations of universal quantum gates are based on single - photon resolving detectors . we propose two implementations , which are nondestructive ( i.e. , destroying only ancilla states ) and work with conventional detectors ( i.e. , which do not resolve number of photons ) . moreover , we analyze a recently proposed scheme of wang et al . [ j. opt . soc . am . b \textbf{27 } , 27 ( 2010 ) ] of an optical iswap gate based on two ancillae in bell 's states , classical feedforward , and conventional detectors with the total probability of success equal to $ \eta^4/32 $ , where $ \eta$ is detector 's efficiency . by observing that the iswap gate can be replaced by the controlled not ( cnot ) gate with additional deterministic gates , we list various possible linear - optical implementations of the iswap gate : ( i ) assuming various ancilla states ( unentangled , two - photon and multiphoton - entangled states ) or no ancillae at all , ( ii ) with or without classical feedforward , ( iii ) destructive or nondestructive schemes , and ( iv ) using conventional or single - photon detectors . in particular , we show how the nondestructive iswap gate can be implemented with the success probability of $ \eta^4/8 $ assuming the same ancillae , classical feedforward , and fewer number of conventional detectors than those in the scheme of wang { \em et al . } we discuss other schemes of the nondestructive universal gates using conventional detectors and entangled ancillae in a cluster state , greenberger - horne - zeilinger and bell 's states giving the success probability of $ \eta^4/4 $ , $ \eta^6/8 $ , and $ \eta^4/8 $ , respectively . in the latter scheme , we analyze how detector imperfections ( dark counts in addition to finite efficiency and no photon - number resolution ) and imperfect sources of ancilla states deteriorate the quantum gate operation .
