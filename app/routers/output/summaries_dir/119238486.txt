in majority of protocols of secure quantum communication ( such as , bb84 , b92 , etc . ) , the unconditional security of the protocols are obtained by using conjugate coding ( two or more mutually unbiased bases ) . initially all the conjugate - coding - based protocols of secure quantum communication were restricted to quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , but later on they were extended to other cryptographic tasks ( such as , secure direct quantum communication and quantum key agreement ) . in contrast to the conjugate - coding - based protocols , a few completely orthogonal - state - based protocols of unconditionally secure qkd ( such as , goldenberg - vaidman ( gv ) and n09 ) were also proposed . however , till the recent past orthogonal - state - based protocols were only a theoretical concept and were limited to qkd . only recently , orthogonal - state - based protocols of qkd are experimentally realized and extended to cryptographic tasks beyond qkd . this paper aims to briefly review the orthogonal - state - based protocols of secure quantum communication that are recently introduced by our group and other researchers .
