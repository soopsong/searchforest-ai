we explore and develop the mathematics of the theory of entanglement measures . after a careful review and analysis of definitions , of preliminary results , and of connections between conditions on entanglement measures , we prove a sharpened version of a uniqueness theorem which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for an entanglement measure to coincide with the reduced von neumann entropy on pure states . we also prove several versions of a theorem on extreme entanglement measures in the case of mixed states . we analyse properties of the asymptotic regularization of entanglement measures proving , for example , convexity for the entanglement cost and for the regularized relative entropy of entanglement .
