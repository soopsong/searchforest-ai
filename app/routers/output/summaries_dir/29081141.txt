we study the problem of site recurrence of discrete time nearest neighbor open quantum random walks ( oqws ) on the integer line , proving basic properties and some of its relations with the corresponding problem for unitary ( coined ) quantum walks ( uqws ) . for both kinds of walks our discussion concerns two notions of recurrence , one given by a monitoring procedure , another in terms of p\'olya numbers , and we study their similarities and differences . in particular , by considering uqws and oqws induced by the same pair of matrices , we discuss the fact that recurrence of these walks are related by an additive interference term in a simple way . based on a previous result of positive recurrence we describe an open quantum version of kac 's lemma for the expected return time to a site .
