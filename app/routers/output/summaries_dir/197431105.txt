compressive sensing is used to perform high - dimensional quantum channel estimation . as an example , we perform a numerical simulation for the case of a qutrit photonic state that is propagated through atmospheric turbulence . using singular value thresholding algorithm based compressive sensing , we determine the channel matrix , which we subsequently use to correct for the atmospheric turbulence induced distortions . as a measure of the success of the procedure we calculate the fidelity and the trace distance of the corrected density matrix against the input qutrit density matrix , and compare the results with those of the uncorrected quantum state density matrix . furthermore , we quantify the amount of the entanglement in the corrected density matrix by calculating the negativity . the results show that compressive sensing could contribute in the development and implementation of free - space quantum and optical communication systems .
