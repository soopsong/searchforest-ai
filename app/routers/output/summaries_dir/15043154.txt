we develop a formal model for distributed measurement - based quantum computations , adopting an agent - based view , such that computations are described locally where possible . because the network quantum state is in general entangled , we need to model it as a global structure , reminiscent of global memory in classical agent systems . local quantum computations are described as measurement patterns . since measurement - based quantum computation is inherently distributed , this allows us to extend naturally several concepts of the measurement calculus , a formal model for such computations . our goal is to define an assembly language , i.e. we assume that computations are well - defined and we do not concern ourselves with verification techniques . the operational semantics for systems of agents is given by a probabilistic transition system , and we define operational equivalence in a way that it corresponds to the notion of bisimilarity . with this in place , we prove that teleportation is bisimilar to a direct quantum channel , and this also within the context of larger networks .
