memristors have been suggested as neuromorphic computing elements . spike - time dependent plasticity and the hodgkin - huxley model of the neuron have both been modelled effectively by memristor theory . the d.c . response of the memristor is a current spike . based on these three facts we suggest that memristors are well - placed to interface directly with neurons . in this paper we show that connecting a spiking memristor network to spiking neuronal cells causes a change in the memristor network dynamics by : removing the memristor spikes , which we show is due to the effects of connection to aqueous medium ; causing a change in current decay rate consistent with a change in memristor state ; presenting more - linear $ i - t$ dynamics ; and increasing the memristor spiking rate , as a consequence of interaction with the spiking neurons . this demonstrates that neurons are capable of communicating directly with memristors , without the need for computer translation .
