we consider two measures of entanglement , the logarithmic negativity and the entanglement entropy , between regions of space in excited states of many - body systems formed by a finite number of particle excitations . in parts i and ii of the current series of papers , it has been shown in one - dimensional free - particle models that , in the limit of large system 's and regions ' sizes , the contribution from the particles is given by the entanglement of natural qubit states , representing the uniform distribution of particles in space . we show that the replica logarithmic negativity and r\'enyi entanglement entropy of such qubit states are equal to the partition functions of certain graphs , that encode the connectivity of the manifold induced by permutation twist fields . using this new connection to graph theory , we provide a general proof , in the massive free boson model , that the qubit result holds in any dimensionality , and for any regions ' shapes and connectivity . the proof is based on clustering and the permutation - twist exchange relations , and is potentially generalisable to other situations , such as lattice models , particle and hole excitations above generalised gibbs ensembles , and interacting integrable models .
