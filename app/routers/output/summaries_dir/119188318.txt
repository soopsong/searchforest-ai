we propose a scheme for the dissipative preparation of w - type entangled steady - states of three atoms trapped in an optical cavity . the scheme is based on the competition between the decay processes into and out of the target state . by suitable choice of system parameters , we resolve the whole evolution process and employ the effective operator formalism to engineer four independent decay processes , so that the target state becomes the stationary state of the quantum system . the scheme requires neither the preparation of definite initial states nor the precise control of system parameters and preparation time .
