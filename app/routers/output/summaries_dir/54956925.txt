the neutrino sector of a seesaw - extended standard model is investigated under the anarchy hypothesis . the previously derived probability density functions for neutrino masses and mixings , which characterize the type i - iii seesaw ensemble of $ n\times n$ complex random matrices , are used to extract information on the relevant physical parameters . for $ n=2 $ and $ n=3 $ , the distributions of the light neutrino masses , as well as the mixing angles and phases , are obtained using numerical integration methods . a systematic comparison with the much simpler type ii seesaw ensemble is also performed to point out the fundamental differences between the two ensembles . it is found that the type i - iii seesaw ensemble is better suited to accommodate experimental data . moreover , the results indicate a strong preference for the mass splitting associated to normal hierarchy . however , since all permutations of the singular values are found to be equally probable for a particular mass splitting , predictions regarding the hierarchy of the mass spectrum remains out of reach in the framework of anarchy .
