we suggest a possible realization of a solid - state memory capacitive ( memcapacitive ) system . our approach relies on the slow polarization rate of a medium between plates of a regular capacitor . to achieve this goal , we consider a multi - layer structure embedded in a capacitor . the multi - layer structure is formed by metallic layers separated by an insulator so that non - linear electronic transport ( tunneling ) between the layers can occur . the suggested memcapacitor shows hysteretic charge - voltage and capacitance - voltage curves , and both negative and diverging capacitance within certain ranges of the field . this proposal can be easily realized experimentally , and indicates the possibility of information storage in memcapacitive devices .
