we consider the algebra of simple operators defined in a time band in a cft with a holographic dual . when the band is smaller than the light crossing time of ads , an entire causal diamond in the center of ads is separated from the band by a horizon . we show that this algebra obeys a version of the reeh - schlieder theorem : the action of the algebra on the cft vacuum can approximate any low energy state in the cft arbitrarily well , but no operator within the algebra can exactly annihilate the vacuum . we show how to relate local excitations in the complement of the central diamond to simple operators in the band . local excitations within the diamond are invisible to the algebra of simple operators in the band by causality , but can be related to complicated operators called"precursors " . we use the reeh - schlieder theorem to write down a simple and explicit formula for these precursors on the boundary . we comment on the implications of our results for black hole complementarity and the emergence of bulk locality from the boundary .
