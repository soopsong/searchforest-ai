we propose a solid - state hybrid platform based on an array of implanted nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers in diamond magnetically coupled to a mechanical oscillator . the mechanical oscillator and the nv electronic spins both act as a quantum bus and allow us to induce an effective long - range interaction between distant nuclear spins , relaxing the requirements on their spatial distance . the coherent nuclear spin - spin interaction , having the form of an ising model , can be maintained in the presence of mechanical damping and spin dephasing via a pulsed dynamical decoupling of the nuclear spins in addition to the microwave driving field of the electronic spins . the present hybrid platform provides a scalable way to prepare multipartite entanglement among nuclear spins with long coherence times and can be applied to generate graph states that may be used for universal quantum computing .
