we propose a quantum circuit composed of $ cnot$ gates and four single - qubit gates to generate a $ w$ state of three qubits . this circuit was then enhanced by integrating two - qubit gates to create a $ w$ state of four and five qubits . after a couple of enhancements , we show that an arbitrary $ w$ state can be generated depending only on the degree of enhancement . the generalized formula for the number of two - qubit gates required is given , showing that an $ n$-qubit $ w$-state generation can be achieved with quadratically increasing number of two - qubit gates . also , the practical feasibility is discussed regarding photon sources and various applications of $ cnot$ gates .
