we theoretically study the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) of the su(1,1 ) interferometer with phase shifts in two arms taking account of realistic noise effects . a generalized phase transform including the phase diffusion effect is presented by the purification process . based on this transform , the analytical qfi and the bound to the quantum precision are derived when considering the effects of phase diffusion and photon losses simultaneously . to beat the standard quantum limit with the reduced precision of phase estimation due to noisy , the upper bounds of decoherence coefficients as a function of total mean photon number are given .
