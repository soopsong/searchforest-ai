phototrophic organisms such as plants , photosynthetic bacteria and algae use microscopic complexes of pigment molecules to absorb sunlight . within the light - harvesting complexes , which frequently have several functional and structural subunits , the energy is transferred in the form of molecular excitations with very high efficiency . green sulfur bacteria are considered to be amongst the most efficient light - harvesting organisms . despite multiple experimental and theoretical studies of these bacteria the physical origin of the efficient and robust energy transfer in their light - harvesting complexes is not well understood . to study excitation dynamics at the systems level we introduce an atomistic model that mimics a complete light - harvesting apparatus of green sulfur bacteria . the model contains approximately 4000 pigment molecules and comprises a double wall roll for the chlorosome , a baseplate and six fenna - matthews - olson trimer complexes . we show that the fast relaxation within functional subunits combined with the transfer between collective excited states of pigments can result in robust energy funneling . energy transfer is robust on the initial excitation conditions and temperature changes . moreover , the same mechanism describes the coexistence of multiple timescales of excitation dynamics frequently observed in ultrafast optical experiments . while our findings support the hypothesis of supertransfer , the model reveals energy transport through multiple channels on different length scales .
