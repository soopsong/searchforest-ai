we show that a squeezed bath , that acts on the central element of a harmonic chain , can drive the whole system to a steady state featuring a series of nested entangled pairs of oscillators that , ideally , covers the whole chain regardless of its size . we study how to realize this effect in various physical implementations , including optomechanical and superconducting devices , using currently available technologies . in these cases no squeezed fields are actually needed , and the squeezed bath is , instead , simulated by quantum reservoir engineering with bichromatic drives .
