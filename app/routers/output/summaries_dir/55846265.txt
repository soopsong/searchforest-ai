a nonrelativistic hamiltonian describing interaction between a mechanical degree of freedom and radiation pressure is commonly used as an ultimate tool for studying system behavior in opto - mechanics . this hamiltonian is derived from the equation of motion of a mechanical degree of freedom and the optical wave equation with time - varying boundary conditions . we show that this approach is deficient for studying higher order nonlinear effects in an open resonant opto - mechanical system . opto - mechanical interaction induces a large mechanical nonlinearity resulting from a strong dependence of the power of the light confined in the optical cavity on the mechanical degrees of freedom of the cavity due to coupling with electromagnetic continuum . this dissipative nonlinearity can not be inferred from the standard hamiltonian formalism .
