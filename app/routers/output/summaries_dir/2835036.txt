we show that trace distance measure of coherence is a strong monotone for all qubit and , so called , $ x$ states . an expression for the trace distance coherence for all pure states and a semi definite program for arbitrary states is provided . we also explore the relation between $ l_1$-norm and relative entropy based measures of coherence , and give a sharp inequality connecting the two . in addition , it is shown that both $ l_p$-norm- and schatten-$p$-norm - based measures violate the ( strong ) monotonicity for all $ p\in(1,\infty)$.
