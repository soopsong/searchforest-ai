recent theoretical studies show that decoherence process can enhance transport efficiency in quantum systems . this effect is known as environment - assisted quantum transport ( enaqt ) . the role of enaqt in optimal quantum transport is well investigated , however , it is less known how robust enaqt is with respect to variations in the system or its environment characteristic . toward answering this question , we simulated excitonic energy transfer in fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) photosynthetic complex . we found that enaqt is robust with respect to many relevant parameters of environmental interactions and frenkel - exciton hamiltonian including reorganization energy , bath frequency cutoff , temperature , and initial excitations , dissipation rate , trapping rate , disorders , and dipole moments orientations . our study suggests that the enaqt phenomenon can be exploited in robust design of highly efficient quantum transport systems .
