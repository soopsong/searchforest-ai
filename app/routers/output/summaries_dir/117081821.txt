we consider a lattice of weakly interacting quantum markov processes . without interaction , the dynamics at each site is relaxing exponentially to a unique stationary state . with interaction , we show that there remains a unique stationary state in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. absence of phase coexistence , and the relaxation towards it is exponentially fast for local observables . we do not assume that the quantum markov process is reversible ( detailed balance ) w.r.t . a local hamiltonian .
