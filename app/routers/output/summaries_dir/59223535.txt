we propose an enhanced discrimination measurement for tripartite 3-dimensional entangled states in order to improve the discernible number of orthogonal entangled states . the scheme suggests 3-dimensional bell state measurement by exploiting composite two 3-dimensional state measurement setups . the setup relies on state - of - the - art techniques , a multi - port interferometer and nondestructive photon number measurements that are used for the post - selection of suitable ensembles . with this scheme , the sifted signal rate of measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution using 3-dimensional quantum states is improved by up to a factor of three compared with that of the best existing setup .
