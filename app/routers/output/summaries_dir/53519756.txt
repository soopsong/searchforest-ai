multipartite entanglement is very poorly understood despite all the theoretical and experimental advances of the last decades . preparation , manipulation and identification of this resource is crucial for both practical and fundamental reasons . however , the difficulty in the practical manipulation and the complexity of the data generated by measurements on these systems increase rapidly with the number of parties . therefore , we would like to experimentally address the problem of how much information about multipartite entanglement we can access with incomplete measurements . in particular , it was shown that some types of pure multipartite entangled states can be witnessed without measuring the correlations [ m. walter et al . , science 340 , 1205 ( 2013 ) ] between parties , which is strongly demanding experimentally . we explore this method using an optical setup that permits the preparation and the complete tomographic reconstruction of many inequivalent classes of three- and four - partite entangled states , and compare complete versus incomplete information . we show that the method is useful in practice , even for non - pure states or non ideal measurement conditions .
