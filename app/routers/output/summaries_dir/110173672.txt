loss is a critical roadblock to achieving photonic quantum - enhanced technologies . we explore a modular platform for implementing integrated photonics experiments and consider the effects of loss at different stages of these experiments , including state preparation , manipulation and measurement . we frame our discussion mainly in the context of quantum sensing and focus particularly on the use of loss - tolerant holland - burnett states for optical phase estimation . in particular , we discuss spontaneous four - wave mixing in standard birefringent fibre as a source of pure , heralded single photons and present methods of optimising such sources . we also outline a route to programmable circuits which allow the control of photonic interactions even in the presence of fabrication imperfections and describe a ratiometric characterisation method for beam splitters which allows the characterisation of complex circuits without the need for full process tomography . finally , we present a framework for performing state tomography on heralded states using lossy measurement devices . this is motivated by a calculation of the effects of fabrication imperfections on precision measurement using holland - burnett states .
