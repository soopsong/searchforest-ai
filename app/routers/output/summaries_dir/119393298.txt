in this paper , we give the mutually unbiased bases on the p^2 -dimensional quantum system where p is an odd prime number , and construct the corresponding unitary transformation based on the properties of these mutually unbiased bases . then , we construct a ( n , n ) threshold secret sharing scheme using unitary transformation between these mutually unbiased bases , and analyze the scheme 's security by several ways , for example , intercept - and - resend attack , entangle - and - measure attack , trojan horse attack , and so on . using our method , we construct a single - particle quantum protocol involving only one qudit , and the method shows much more scalability than other schemes .
