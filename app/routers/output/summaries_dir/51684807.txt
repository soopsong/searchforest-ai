by coupling a $ \lambda$-type quantum emitter to a chiral waveguide , in which the polarization of a photon is locked to its propagation direction , we propose a controllable photon - emitter interface for quantum networks . we show that this chiral system enables the swap gate and a hybrid - entangling gate between the emitter and a flying single photon . it also allows deterministic storage and retrieval of single - photon states with high fidelities and efficiencies . in short , this chirally coupled emitter - photon interface can be a critical building block toward a large - scale quantum network .
