we consider an electromagnetic waveguide with a time - dependent propagation speed $ v(t)$ as an analog for cosmological particle creation . in contrast to most previous studies which focus on the number of particles produced , we calculate the corresponding two - point correlation function . for a small step - like variation $ \delta v(t)$ , this correlator displays characteristic signatures of particle pair creation . as another potential advantage , this observable is of first order in the perturbation $ \delta v(t)$ , whereas the particle number is second order in $ \delta v(t)$ and thus stronger suppressed for small $ \delta v(t)$.
