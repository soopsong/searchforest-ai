master equations in the lindblad form describe evolution of open quantum systems that is completely positive and simultaneously has a semigroup property . we analyze a possibility to derive this type of master equations from an intrinsically discrete dynamics that is modelled as a sequence of collisions between a given quantum system ( a qubit ) with particles that form the environment . in order to illustrate our approach we analyze in detail how a process of an exponential decay and a process of decoherence can be derived from a collision - like model in which particular collisions are described by swap and controlled - not interactions , respectively .
