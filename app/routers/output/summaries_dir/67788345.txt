we introduce a new architecture - agnostic methodology for mapping abstract quantum circuits to realistic quantum computing devices with restricted qubit connectivity , as implemented by cambridge quantum computing 's tket compiler . we present empirical results showing the effectiveness of this method in terms of reducing two - qubit gate depth and two - qubit gate count , compared to other implementations .
