we report on progress towards implementing mixed ion species quantum information processing for a scalable ion trap architecture . mixed species chains may help solve several problems with scaling ion trap quantum computation to large numbers of qubits . initial temperature measurements of linear coulomb crystals containing barium and ytterbium ions indicate that the mass difference does not significantly impede cooling at low ion numbers . average motional occupation numbers are estimated to be $ \bar{n } \approx 130 $ quanta per mode for chains with small numbers of ions , which is within a factor of three of the doppler limit for barium ions in our trap . we also discuss generation of ion - photon entanglement with barium ions with a fidelity of $ f \ge 0.84 $ , which is an initial step towards remote ion - ion coupling in a more scalable quantum information architecture . further , we are working to implement these techniques in surface traps in order to exercise greater control over ion chain ordering and positioning .
