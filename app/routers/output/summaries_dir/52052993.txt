this paper presents a physics - based analytical model for the mos transistor operating continuously from room temperature down to liquid - helium temperature ( 4.2 k ) from depletion to strong inversion and in the linear and saturation regimes . the model is developed relying on the 1d poisson equation and the drift - diffusion transport mechanism . the validity of the maxwell - boltzmann approximation is demonstrated in the limit to zero kelvin as a result of dopant freeze - out in cryogenic equilibrium . explicit mos transistor expressions are then derived including incomplete dopant - ionization , bandgap widening , mobility reduction , and interface charge traps . the temperature dependency of the interface - trapping process explains the discrepancy between the measured value of the subthreshold swing and the thermal limit at deep - cryogenic temperatures . the accuracy of the developed model is validated by experimental results on a commercially available 28-nm bulk cmos process . the proposed model provides the core expressions for the development of physically - accurate compact models dedicated to low - temperature cmos circuit simulation .
