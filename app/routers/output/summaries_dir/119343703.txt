we investigate the quality ( q ) factor and the mode dispersion of single - defect nanocavities based on a triangular - lattice gaas photonic - crystal ( pc ) membrane , which contain inas quantum dots ( qds ) as a broadband emitter . to obtain a high q factor for the dipole mode , we modulate the radii and positions of the air holes surrounding the nanocavity while keeping six - fold symmetry . a maximum q of 17,000 is experimentally demonstrated with a mode volume of v=0.39(lambda / n)^3 . we obtain a q / v of 44,000(n / lambda)^3 , one of the highest values ever reported with qd - embedded pc nanocavities . we also observe ten cavity modes within the first photonic bandgap for the modulated structure . their dispersion and polarization properties agree well with the numerical results .
