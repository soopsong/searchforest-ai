we introduce a general framework for analyzing the thermodynamics of small systems that are driven by both a periodic temperature variation and some external parameter modulating their energy . this set - up covers , in particular , periodic micro and nano - heat engines . in a first step , we show how to express total entropy production by properly identified time - independent affinities and currents without making a linear response assumption . in linear response , kinetic coefficients akin to onsager coefficients can be identified . specializing to a fokker - planck type dynamics , we show that these coefficients can be expressed as a sum of an adiabatic contribution and one reminiscent of a green - kubo expression that contains deviations from adiabaticity . furthermore , we show that the generalized kinetic coefficients fulfill an onsager - casimir type symmetry tracing back to microscopic reversibility . this symmetry allows for non - identical off - diagonal coefficients if the driving protocols are not symmetric under time - reversal . we then derive a novel constraint on the kinetic coefficients that is sharper than the second law and provides an efficiency - dependent bound on power . as one consequence , we can prove that the power vanishes at least linearly when approaching carnot efficiency . we illustrate our general framework by explicitly working out the paradigmatic case of a brownian heat engine realized by a colloidal particle in a time - dependent harmonic trap subject to a periodic temperature profile . this case study reveals inter alia that our new general bound on power is asymptotically tight .
