we theoretically investigate the critical properties of a single driven - dissipative nonlinear photon mode . in a well - defined thermodynamical limit of large excitation numbers , the exact quantum solution describes a first - order phase transition in the regime where semiclassical theory predicts optical bistability . we study the behavior of the complex spectral gap associated with the liouvillian superoperator of the corresponding master equation . we show that in this limit the liouvillian gap vanishes exponentially and that the bimodality of the photon wigner function disappears . the connection between the considered thermodynamical limit of large photon numbers for the single - mode cavity and the thermodynamical limit of many cavities for a driven - dissipative bose - hubbard system is discussed .
