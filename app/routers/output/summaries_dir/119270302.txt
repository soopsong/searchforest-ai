we show that the technique known as concatenated continuous dynamical decoupling ( ccd ) can be applied to a trapped - ion setup for a robust implementation of the quantum rabi model in a variety of parameter regimes . these include the case where the dirac equation emerges , and the limit in which a quantum phase transition takes place . we discuss the applicability of the ccd scheme in terms of the fidelity between different initial states evolving under an ideal quantum rabi model and their corresponding trapped - ion realization , and demonstrate the effectiveness of noise suppression of our method .
