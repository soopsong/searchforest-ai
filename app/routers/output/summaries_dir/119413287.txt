we propose a mechanism of unconventional rydberg pumping ( urp ) via simultaneously driving each rydberg atom by two classical fields with different strengths of rabi frequencies . this mechanism differs from the general rydberg blockade or rydberg antiblockade since it is closely related to the ground states of atoms , i.e. two atoms in the same ground state are stable while two atoms in different ground states are resonantly excited . furthermore , we find the urp can be employed to simplify some special quantum information processing tasks , such as implementation of a three - qubit controlled phase gate with only a single rabi oscillation , preparation of two- and three - dimensional steady - state entanglement with two identical atoms , and realization of the autonomous quantum error correction in a rydberg - atom - cavity system . the feasibility of the above applications is certified explicitly by the state - of - the - art technology .
