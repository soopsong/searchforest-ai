we propose a procedure for transferring the state a microwave qubit via a transmission line from one resonator to another resonator , with a theoretical efficiency arbitrarily close to 100 % . the emission and capture of the microwave energy is performed using tunable couplers , whose transmission coefficients vary in time . using the superconducting phase qubit technology and tunable couplers with maximum coupling of 100 mhz , the procedure with theoretical efficiency $ \eta=0.999 $ requires a duration of about 400 ns ( excluding propagation time ) and an on / off ratio of 45 . the procedure may also be used for a quantum state transfer with optical photons .
