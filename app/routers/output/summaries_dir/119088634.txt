we describe a simple and efficient setup to generate and characterize femtosecond quadrature - entangled pulses . quantum correlations equivalent to about 2.5 db squeezing are efficiently and easily reached using the non - degenerate parametric amplification of femtosecond pulses through a single - pass in a thin ( 0.1 mm ) potassium niobate crystal . the entangled pulses are then individually sampled to characterize the non - separability and the entropy of formation of the states . the complete experiment is analysed in the time - domain , from the pulsed source of quadrature entanglement to the time - resolved homodyne detection . this particularity allows for applications in quantum communication protocols using continuous - variable entanglement .
