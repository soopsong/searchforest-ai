we introduce a new set of noncommutative space - time commutation relations in two space dimensions . the space - space commutation relations are deformations of the standard flat noncommutative space - time relations taken here to have position dependent structure constants . some of the new variables are non - hermitian in the most natural choice . we construct their hermitian counterparts by means of a dyson map , which also serves to introduce a new metric operator . we propose ptlike symmetries , i.e.antilinear involutory maps , respected by these deformations . we compute minimal lengths and momenta arising in this space from generalized versions of heisenberg 's uncertainty relations and find that any object in this two dimensional space is string like , i.e.having a fundamental length in one direction beyond which a resolution is impossible . subsequently we formulate and partly solve some simple models in these new variables , the free particle , its pt - symmetric deformations and the harmonic oscillator .
