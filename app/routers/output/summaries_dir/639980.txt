by mapping the strong interaction between rydberg excitations in ultra - cold atomic ensembles onto single photons via electromagnetically induced transparency , it is now possible to realize a nonlinear optical medium which exhibits a strong optical nonlinearity at the level of individual photons . we review the theoretical concepts and the experimental state - of - the - art of this exciting new field , and discuss first applications in the field of all - optical quantum information processing .
