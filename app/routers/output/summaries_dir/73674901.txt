we consider state transfer between two qubits - effective two - level systems represented by rydberg atoms - via a common mode of a microwave cavity at finite temperature . we find that when both qubits have the same coupling strength to the cavity field , at large enough detuning from the cavity mode frequency , quantum interference between the transition paths makes the swap of the excitation between the qubits largely insensitive to the number of thermal photons in the cavity . when , however , the coupling strengths are different , the photon number - dependent differential stark shift of the transition frequencies precludes efficient transfer . nevertheless , using an auxiliary cooling system to continuously extract the cavity photons , we can still achieve a high - fidelity state transfer between the qubits .
