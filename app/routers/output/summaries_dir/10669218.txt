much of the novel physics predicted to be observable in the ultrastrong light - matter coupling regime rests on the hybridisation between states with different numbers of excitations , leading to a population of virtual photons in the system 's ground state . in this article , exploiting an exact diagonalisation approach , we derive both analytical and numerical results for the population of virtual photons in presence of arbitrary losses . specialising our results to the case of lorentzian resonances we then show that the virtual photon population is only quantitatively affected by losses , even when those become the dominant energy scale . our results demonstrate most of the ultrastrong - coupling phenomenology can be observed in loss - dominated systems which are not even in the standard strong coupling regime . we thus open the possibility to investigate ultrastrong - coupling physics to platforms that were previously considered unsuitable due to their large losses .
