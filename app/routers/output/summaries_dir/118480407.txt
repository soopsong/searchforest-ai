planar superconducting microwave resonators are key elements in a variety of technical applications and also act as sensitive probes for microwave spectroscopy of various materials of interest . here superconducting pb is a suitable material as a basis for microwave stripline resonators . to utilize pb stripline resonators in a variable magnetic field ( e.g. in esr ) , the electrodynamics of such resonators in finite magnetic field has to be well understood . therefore we performed microwave transmission measurements on superconducting pb stripline resonators in a variable , parallel magnetic field . we determined surface resistance , penetration depth as well as real and imaginary parts , \sigma$_1 $ and \sigma$_2 $ , of the complex conductivity of superconducting pb as a function of magnetic field . here we find features reminiscent of those in temperature - dependent measurements , such as a maximum in \sigma$_1 $ ( coherence peak ) . at magnetic fields above the critical field of this type - i superconductor we still find low - loss microwave response , which we assign to remaining superconductivity in the form of filaments within the pb . hysteresis effects are found in the quality factor of resonances once the swept magnetic field has exceeded the critical magnetic field . this is due to normal conducting areas that are pinned and can therefore persist in the superconducting phase . besides zero - field - cooling we show an alternative way to eliminate these even at t < t$_c$. based on our microwave data , we determine the critical magnetic field and the critical temperature of pb in a temperature range between 1.6k and 6.5k and magnetic fields up to 140mt , showing good agreement with bcs predictions . we study a sn sample in a pb resonator to demonstrate the applicability of superconducting pb stripline resonators in the experimental study of other ( super-)conducting materials in a variable magnetic field .
