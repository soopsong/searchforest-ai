a useful kind of continuity of quantum states functions in asymptotic regime is so - called asymptotic continuity . in this paper we provide general tools for checking if a function possesses this property . first we prove equivalence of asymptotic continuity with so - called it robustness under admixture . this allows us to show that relative entropy distance from a convex set including maximally mixed state is asymptotically continuous . subsequently , we consider it arrowing - a way of building a new function out of a given one . the procedure originates from constructions of intrinsic information and entanglement of formation . we show that arrowing preserves asymptotic continuity for a class of functions ( so - called subextensive ones ) . the result is illustrated by means of several examples .
