quantum thermal devices which can manage heat as their electronic analogues for the electronic currents have attracted increasing attention . here a three - terminal quantum thermal device is designed by three coupling qubits interacting with three heat baths with different temperatures . based on the steady - state behavior solved from the dynamics of this system , it is demonstrated that such a device integrates multiple interesting thermodynamic functions . it can serve as a heat current transistor to use the weak heat current at one terminal to effectively amplify the currents through the other two terminals , to continuously modulate them ranging in a large amplitude , and even to switch on / off the heat currents . it is also found that the three currents are not sensitive to the fluctuation of the temperature at the low temperature terminal , so it can behave as a thermal stabilizer . in addition , we can utilize one terminal temperature to ideally turn off the heat current at any one terminal and to allow the heat currents through the other two terminals , so it can be used as a thermal valve . finally , we illustrate that this thermal device can control the heat currents to flow unidirectionally , so it has the function as a thermal rectifier .
