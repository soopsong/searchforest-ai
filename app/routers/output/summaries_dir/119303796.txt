linear optics quantum computing ( loqc ) is a leading candidate for the implementation of large scale quantum computers . here quantum information is encoded into the quantum states of light and computation proceeds via a linear optics network . it is well known that in such schemes there are stringent requirements on the spatio - temporal structure of photons -- they must be completely indistinguishable and of very high purity . we show that in the boson - sampling model for loqc these conditions may be significantly relaxed . we present evidence that by increasing the size of the system we can implement a computationally hard algorithm even if our photons have arbitrarily low fidelity and purity . these relaxed conditions make boson - sampling loqc within reach of present - day technology .
