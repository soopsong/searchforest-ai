we present a new experimental approach to investigate the magnetic properties of the anisotropic heavy - fermion system ybrh$_2$si$_2 $ as a function of crystallographic orientation . angle - dependent electron spin resonance ( esr ) measurements are performed at a low temperature of 1.6 k and at an esr frequency of 4.4 ghz utilizing a superconducting planar microwave resonator in a $ ^4$he - cryostat in combination with in - situ sample rotation . the obtained esr g - factor of ybrh$_2$si$_2 $ as a function of the crystallographic angle is consistent with results of previous measurements using conventional esr spectrometers at higher frequencies and fields . perspectives to implement this experimental approach into a dilution refrigerator and to reach the magnetically ordered phase of ybrh$_2$si$_2 $ are discussed .
