the violation of the cauchy - schwarz and bell inequalities ranks among the major evidences of the genuinely quantum nature of an emitter . we show that by dispensing from the usual approximation of mode correlations and studying directly correlations between the physical reality -the photons- these violations can be optimized . this is achieved by extending the concept of photon correlations to all frequencies in all the possible windows of detections , with no prejudice to the supposed origin of the photons . we identify the regions of quantum emission as rooted in collective de - excitation involving virtual states instead of , as previously assumed , cascaded transitions between real states .
