the interaction of a two - level atom with a single - mode quantized field is one of the simplest models in quantum optics . under the rotating wave approximation , it is known as the jaynes - cummings model and without it as the rabi model . real - world realizations of the jaynes - cummings model include cavity , ion trap and circuit quantum electrodynamics . the rabi model can be realized in circuit quantum electrodynamics . as soon as nonlinear couplings are introduced , feasible experimental realizations in quantum systems are drastically reduced . we propose a set of two photonic lattices that classically simulates the interaction of a single two - level system with a quantized field under field nonlinearities and nonlinear couplings as long as the quantum optics model conserves parity . we describe how to reconstruct the mean value of quantum optics measurements , such as photon number and atomic energy excitation , from the intensity and from the field , such as von neumann entropy and fidelity , at the output of the photonic lattices . we discuss how typical initial states involving coherent or displaced fock fields can be engineered from recently discussed glauber - fock lattices . as an example , the buck - sukumar model , where the coupling depends on the intensity of the field , is classically simulated for separable and entangled initial states .
