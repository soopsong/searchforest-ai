the purpose of this paper is to derive filters for an arbitrary open quantum system driven by a light wavepacket prepared in a continuous - mode multi - photon state . a continuous - mode multi - photon state is a state of a travelling light wavepacket that contains a definite number of photons and is characterised by a temporal ( or equivalently spectral ) profile . after the interaction with the system , the outgoing light can be monitored by means of homodyne detection or photodetection . filters for both measurement schemes are derived in this paper . unlike the vacuum or the coherent state case , the annihilation operator of the light field acting on a multi - photon state changes the state by annihilating a photon , and this makes the traditional filtering techniques inapplicable . to circumvent this difficulty , we adopt a non - markovian embedding technique proposed in \cite{gough:2013 } for the study of the single - photon filtering problem . however , the multi - photon nature of the problem addressed in this paper makes the study much more mathematically involved . moreover , as demonstrated by an example --- a two - level system driven by a continuous - mode two - photon state , multi - photon filters can reveal interesting strong nonlinear optical phenomena absent in both the single - photon state case and the continuous - mode fock state case .
