we generalize the recently proposed resource theory of coherence ( or superposition ) [ baumgratz , cramer&plenio , phys . rev . lett . 113:140401 ; winter&yang , phys . rev . lett . 116:120404 ] to the setting where not only the free ( " incoherent " ) resources , but also the objects manipulated are quantum operations , rather than states . in particular , we discuss an information theoretic notion of coherence capacity of a quantum channel , and prove a single - letter formula for it in the case of unitaries . then we move to the coherence cost of simulating a channel , and prove achievability results for unitaries and general channels acting on a $ d$-dimensional system ; we show that a maximally coherent state of rank $ d$ is always sufficient as a resource if incoherent operations are allowed . we also show lower bounds on the simulation cost of channels that allow us to conclude that there exists bound coherence in operations , i.e. maps with non - zero cost of implementing them but zero coherence capacity ; this is in contrast to states , which do not exhibit bound coherence .
