the quantum capacity of bosonic gaussian quantum channels can be non - additive in a particularly striking way : a pair of such optical - fiber type channels can individually have zero quantum capacity but super - activate each other such that the combined channel has strictly positive capacity . this has been shown in [ nature photonics 5 , 624 ( 2011 ) ] where it was conjectured that squeezing is a necessary resource for this phenomenon . we provide a proof of this conjecture by showing that for gauge covariant channels a choi matrix with positive partial transpose implies that the channel is entanglement - breaking . in addition , we construct an example which shows that this implication fails to hold for gaussian channels which arise from passive interactions with a squeezed environment .
