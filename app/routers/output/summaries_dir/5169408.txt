quantum coherence is one of the primary non - classical features of quantum systems . while protocols such as the leggett - garg inequality ( lgi ) and quantum tomography can be used to test for the existence of quantum coherence and dynamics in a given system , unambiguously detecting inherent"quantumness"still faces serious obstacles in terms of experimental feasibility and efficiency , particularly in complex systems . here we introduce two"quantum witnesses"to efficiently verify quantum coherence and dynamics in the time domain , without the expense and burden of non - invasive measurements or full tomographic processes . using several physical examples , including quantum transport in solid - state nanostructures and in biological organisms , we show that these quantum witnesses are robust and have a much finer resolution in their detection window than the lgi has . these robust quantum indicators may assist in reducing the experimental overhead in unambiguously verifying quantum coherence in complex systems .
