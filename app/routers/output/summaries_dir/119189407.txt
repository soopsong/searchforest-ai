the strong interaction between rydberg atoms can be used to control the strength and character of the interatomic interaction in ultracold gases by weakly dressing the atoms with a rydberg state . elaborate theoretical proposals for the realization of various complex phases and applications in quantum simulation exist . also a simple model has been already developed that describes the basic idea of rydberg dressing in a two - atom basis . however , an experimental realization has been elusive so far . we present a model describing the ground state of a bose - einstein condensate dressed with a rydberg level based on the rydberg blockade . this approach provides an intuitive understanding of the transition from pure twobody interaction to a regime of collective interactions . furthermore it enables us to calculate the deformation of a three - dimensional sample under realistic experimental conditions in mean - field approximation . we compare full three - dimensional numerical calculations of the ground state to an analytic expression obtained within thomas - fermi approximation . finally we discuss limitations and problems arising in an experimental realization of rydberg dressing based on our experimental results . our work enables the reader to straight forwardly estimate the experimental feasibility of rydberg dressing in realistic three - dimensional atomic samples .
