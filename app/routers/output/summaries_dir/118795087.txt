we introduce a fault - tolerant construction to implement a composite quantum operation of four overlapping toffoli gates . the same construction can produce two independent toffoli gates . this result lowers resource overheads in designs for quantum computers by more than an order of magnitude . the procedure uses clifford operations and 64 copies of the non - clifford gate $ t = \exp[i \pi ( i - \sigma^z ) /8]$. quantum codes detect errors in the circuit . when the dominant source of error is $ t$-gate failure with probability $ p$ , then the composite toffoli circuit has postselected failure rate of $ 3072p^4 $ to lowest order .
