quantum properties of the probes used to estimate a classical parameter can be used to attain accuracies that beat the standard quantum limit . when qubits are used to construct a quantum probe , it is known that initializing $ n$ qubits in an entangled"cat state,"rather than in a separable state , can improve the measurement uncertainty by a factor of $ 1/\sqrt{n}$. we investigate how the measurement uncertainty is affected when the individual qubits in a probe are subjected to decoherence . in the face of such decoherence , we regard the rate $ r$ at which qubits can be generated and the total duration $ \tau$ of a measurement as fixed resources , and we determine the optimal use of entanglement among the qubits and the resulting optimal measurement uncertainty as functions of $ r$ and $ \tau$.
