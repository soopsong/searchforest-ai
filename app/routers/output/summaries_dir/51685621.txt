uncertainty principle is one of the central concepts in quantum theory . different forms of this particular principle have been discoursed in various foundational and information theoretic topics . in the discrete input - output scenario the limited nonlocal behavior of quantum theory has been explained by fine - grained uncertainty relation . on the other hand , in continuous variable paradigm robertson - schrodinger ( rs ) uncertainty relation has been used to detect multi - mode entanglement . here we show that rs uncertainty relation plays an important role to discriminate between quantum and post - quantum nonlocal correlations in multi - mode continuous outcome scenario . we provide a class of m - mode post - quantum nonlocal correlations with continuous outcome spectrum . while nonlocality of the introduced class of correlations is established through calvalcanti - foster - reid - drummond ( cfrd ) class of bell inequalities , rs uncertainty relation detects their post - quantum nature . our result is a hint towards a wider role of uncertainty principle in the study of nonlocality in continuous variable multi - mode systems .
