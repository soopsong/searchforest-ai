we present a semiclassical theory for the delayed response of a quantum dot ( qd ) to oscillations of a coupled nanomechanical resonator ( nr ) . we prove that the back - action of the qd changes both the resonant frequency and the quality factor of the nr . an increase or decrease in the quality factor of the nr corresponds to either an enhancement or damping of the oscillations , which can also be interpreted as sisyphus amplification or cooling of the nr by the qd .
