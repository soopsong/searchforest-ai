we present quantum protocols for executing arbitrarily accurate $ \pi/2^k$ rotations of a qubit about its $ z$ axis . reduced instruction set computing ( \textsc{risc } ) architectures typically restrict the instruction set to stabilizer operations and a single non - stabilizer operation , such as preparation of a"magic"state from which $ t = z(\pi/4)$ gates can be teleported . although the overhead required to distill high - fidelity copies of this magic state is high , the subsequent quantum compiling overhead to realize $ z$ rotations in a \textsc{risc } architecture can be much greater . we develop a complex instruction set computing ( \textsc{cisc } ) architecture whose instruction set includes stabilizer operations and preparation of magic states from which $ z(\pi/2^k)$ gates can be teleported , for $ 2 \leq k \leq k_{\text{max}}$. this results in a substantial overall reduction in the number of gates required to achieve a desired gate accuracy for $ z$ rotations . the key to our construction is a family of shortened quantum reed - muller codes of length $ 2^{k+2}-1 $ , whose magic - state distillation threshold shrinks with $ k$ but is greater than 0.85 % for $ k \leq 6$.
