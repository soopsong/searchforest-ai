we describe a direct method for experimental determination of the negativity of an arbitrary two - qubit state with 11 measurements performed on multiple copies of the two - qubit system . our method is based on the experimentally accessible sequences of singlet projections performed on up to four qubit pairs . in particular , our method permits the application of the peres - horodecki separability criterion to an arbitrary two - qubit state . we explicitly demonstrate that measuring entanglement in terms of negativity requires three measurements more than detecting two - qubit entanglement . the reported minimal set of interferometric measurements provides a complete description of bipartite quantum entanglement in terms of two - photon interference . this set is smaller than the set of 15 measurements needed to perform a complete quantum state tomography of an arbitrary two - qubit system . finally , we demonstrate that the set of 9 makhlin 's invariants needed to express the negativity can be measured by performing 13 multicopy projections . we demonstrate that these invariants are both a useful theoretical concept for designing specialized quantum interferometers and that their direct measurement within the framework of linear optics does not require performing complete quantum state tomography .
