we theoretically study the unique applications of optomechanics based on traveling - wave microresonators , where the optomechanical coupling of degenerate modes can be enhanced selectively by optically pumping in different directions . we show that the unique features of degenerate optical modes can be applied to the entangled photon generation of clockwise and counter - clockwise optical modes , and the nonclassicality of entangled photon pair is discussed . the coherent coupling between the clockwise and counter - clockwise optical mods and two acoustic modes is also studied , in which the relative phase of the optomechanical couplings plays a key role in the optical non - reciprocity . the parity - time symmetry of acoustic modes can be observed in the slightly deformed microresonator with the interaction of forward and backward stimulated brillouin scattering in the triple - resonance system . in addition , the degenerate modes are in the decoherence - free subspace , which is robust against environmental noises . based on parameters realized in recent experiments , these optomechanical devices should be readily achievable .
