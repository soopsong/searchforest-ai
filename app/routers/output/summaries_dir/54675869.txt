we study the quality of service in quantum channels . we regard the quantum channel as a queueing system , and present queueing analysis of both the classical information transmission and quantum information transmission in the quantum channel . for the former , we link the analysis to the classical queueing model , for the latter , we propose a new queueing model and investigate the limit queueing behavior . for both scenarios , we obtain tail distributions of the performance measures , i.e. , backlog , delay , and throughput .
