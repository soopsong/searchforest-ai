we experimentally demonstrate amplitude and phase modulation of a time - energy entangled two - photon wave function . the entangled photons are produced by spontaneous parametric down - conversion , spectrally dispersed in an prism compressor , modulated in amplitude and/or phase , and detected in coincidence by sum - frequency generation . first , we present a fourier optical analysis of the optical setup yielding an analytic expression for the resulting field distribution at the exit plane of the shaping apparatus . we then introduce amplitude and/or phase shaping and present results which can only be obtained through a combination of the two . specifically , we use a shaper - based interferometer to measure the two - photon interference of an almost bandwidth - limited two - photon wave function .
