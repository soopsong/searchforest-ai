we provide a rigorous derivation of a quantum filter for the case of multiple measurements being made on a quantum system . we consider a class of measurement processes which are functions of bosonic field operators , including combinations of diffusive and poissonian processes . this covers the standard cases from quantum optics , where homodyne detection may be described as a diffusive process and photon counting may be described as a poissonian process . we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for any pair of such measurements taken at different output channels to satisfy a commutation relationship . then , we derive a general , multiple measurement quantum filter as an extension of a single - measurement quantum filter . as an application we explicitly obtain the quantum filter corresponding to homodyne detection and photon counting at the output ports of a beam splitter , correcting an earlier result .
