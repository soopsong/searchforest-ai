quantum annealing devices such as the ones produced by d - wave systems are typically used for solving optimization and sampling tasks , and in both academia and industry the characterization of their usefulness is subject to active research . any problem that can naturally be described as a weighted , undirected graph may be a particularly interesting candidate , since such a problem may be formulated a as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization ( qubo ) instance , which is solvable on d - wave 's chimera graph architecture . in this paper , we introduce a quantum - assisted finite - element method for design optimization . we show that we can minimize a shape - specific quantity , in our case a ray approximation of sound pressure at a specific position around an object , by manipulating the shape of this object . our algorithm belongs to the class of quantum - assisted algorithms , as the optimization task runs iteratively on a d - wave 2000q quantum processing unit ( qpu ) , whereby the evaluation and interpretation of the results happens classically . our first and foremost aim is to explain how to represent and solve parts of these problems with the help of a qpu , and not to prove supremacy over existing classical finite - element algorithms for design optimization .
