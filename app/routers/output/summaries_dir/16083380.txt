we consider transfer of a highly nonclassical quantum state through an optomechanical system . that is we investigate a protocol consisting of sequential upload , storage and reading out of the quantum state from a mechanical mode of an optomechanical system . we show that provided the input state is in a test - bed single - photon fock state , the wigner function of the recovered state can have negative values at the origin , which is a manifest of nonclassicality of the quantum state of the macroscopic mechanical mode and the overall transfer protocol itself . moreover , we prove that the recovered state is quantum non - gaussian for wide range of setup parameters . we verify that current electromechanical and optomechanical experiments can test this complete transfer of single photon .
