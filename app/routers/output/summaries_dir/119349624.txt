measurement feedback is a versatile and powerful tool , although its performance is limited by several practical imperfections resulting from classical components . this paper shows that , for some typical quantum feedback control problems for state preparation ( stabilization of a qubit or a qutrit , spin squeezing , and fock state generation ) , the classical feedback operation can be replaced by a fully quantum one such that the state autonomously dissipates into the target or a state close to the target . the main common feature of the proposed quantum operation , which is called coherent feedback , is that it is composed of a series of dispersive and dissipative couplings inspired by the corresponding measurement feedback scheme .
