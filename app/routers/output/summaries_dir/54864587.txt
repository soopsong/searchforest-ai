an experimental demonstration of a non - classical state of a nanomechanical resonator is still an outstanding task . in this paper we show how the resonator can be cooled and driven into a squeezed state by a bichromatic microwave coupling to a charge qubit . the stationary oscillator state exhibits a reduced noise in one of the quadrature components by a factor of 0.5 - 0.2 . these values are obtained for a 100 mhz resonator with a q - value of 10$^4 $ to 10$^5 $ and for support temperatures of t $ \approx$ 25 mk . we show that the coupling to the charge qubit can also be used to detect the squeezed state via measurements of the excited state population . furthermore , by extending this measurement procedure a complete quantum state tomography of the resonator state can be performed . this provides a universal tool to detect a large variety of different states and to prove the quantum nature of a nanomechanical oscillator .
