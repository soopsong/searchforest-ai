since a limit distribution of a discrete - time quantum walk on the line was derived in 2002 , a lot of limit theorems for quantum walks with a localized initial state have been reported . on the other hand , in quantum probability theory , there are four notions of independence ( free , monotone , commuting , and boolean independence ) and quantum central limit theorems associated to each independence have been investigated . the relation between quantum walks and quantum probability theory is still unknown . as random walks are fundamental models in the kolmogorov probability theory , can the quantum walks play an important role in quantum probability theory ? to discuss this problem , we focus on a discrete - time 2-state quantum walk with a non - localized initial state and present a limit theorem . by using our limit theorem , we generate probability laws in the quantum central limit theorems from the quantum walk .
