we explore the quantum - classical crossover of two coupled , identical , superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) rings . we note that the motivation for this work is based on a study of a similar system comprising two coupled duffing oscillators . in that work we showed that the entanglement characteristics of chaotic and periodic ( entrained ) solutions differed significantly and that in the classical limit entanglement was preserved only in the chaotic - like solutions . however , duffing oscillators are a highly idealised toy model . motivated by a wish to explore more experimentally realisable systems we now extend our work to an analysis of two coupled squid rings . we observe some differences in behaviour between the system that is based on squid rings rather than on duffing oscillators . however , we show that the two systems share a common feature . that is , even when the squid ring 's trajectories appear to follow ( semi ) classical orbits entanglement persists .
