we report the first complete characterization of single - qubit and two - qubit gate fidelities in silicon - based spin qubits , including cross - talk and error correlations between the two qubits . to do so , we use a combination of standard randomized benchmarking and a recently introduced method called character randomized benchmarking , which allows for more reliable estimates of the two - qubit fidelity in this system . interestingly , with character randomized benchmarking , the two - qubit cphase gate fidelity can be obtained by studying the additional decay induced by interleaving the cphase gate in a reference sequence of single - qubit gates only . this work sets the stage for further improvements in all the relevant gate fidelities in silicon spin qubits beyond the error threshold for fault - tolerant quantum computation .
