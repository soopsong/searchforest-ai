one of the most sought - after goals in experimental quantum communication is the implementation of a quantum repeater . the performance of quantum repeaters can be assessed by comparing the attained rate with the quantum and private capacity of direct transmission , assisted by unlimited classical two - way communication . however , these quantities are hard to compute , motivating the search for upper bounds . takeoka , guha and wilde found the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel to be an upper bound on both these capacities . in general it is still hard to find the exact value of the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel , but clever sub - optimal squashing channels allow one to upper bound this quantity , and thus also the corresponding capacities . here , we exploit this idea to obtain bounds for any phase - insensitive gaussian bosonic channel . this bound allows one to benchmark the implementation of quantum repeaters for a large class of channels used to model communication across fibers . in particular , our bound is applicable to the realistic scenario when there is a restriction on the mean photon number on the input . furthermore , we show that the squashed entanglement of a channel is convex in the set of channels , and we use a connection between the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel and its entanglement assisted classical capacity . building on this connection , we obtain the exact squashed entanglement and two - way assisted capacities of the $ d$-dimensional erasure channel and bounds on the amplitude - damping channel and all qubit pauli channels . in particular , our bound improves on the previous best known squashed entanglement upper bound of the depolarizing channel .
