we apply a recently developed theory for metastability in open quantum systems to a one - dimensional dissipative quantum ising model . earlier results suggest this model features either a non - equilibrium phase transition or a smooth but sharp crossover , where the stationary state changes from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic , accompanied by strongly intermittent emission dynamics characteristic of first - order coexistence between dynamical phases . we show that for a range of parameters close to this transition / crossover point the dynamics of the finite system displays pronounced metastability , i.e. , the system relaxes first to long - lived metastable states , before eventual relaxation to the true stationary state . from the spectral properties of the quantum master operator we characterise the low - dimensional manifold of metastable states , which are shown to be probability mixtures of two , paramagnetic and ferromagnetic , metastable phases . we also show that for long times the dynamics can be approximated by a classical stochastic dynamics between the metastable phases that is directly related to the intermittent dynamics observed in quantum trajectories and thus the dynamical phases .
