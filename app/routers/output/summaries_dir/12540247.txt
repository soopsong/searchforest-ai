we describe a scheme for using an all - electrical , rapid , adiabatic population transfer between two spatially separated dots in a triple - quantum dot system . the electron spends no time in the middle dot and does not change its energy during the transfer process . although a coherent population transfer method , this scheme may well prove useful in incoherent electronic computation ( for example quantum - dot cellular automata ) where it may provide a coherent advantage to an otherwise incoherent device . it can also be thought of as a limiting case of type ii quantum computing , where sufficient coherence exists for a single gate operation , but not for the preservation of superpositions after the operation . we extend our analysis to the case of many intervening dots and address the issue of transporting quantum information through a multi - dot system .
