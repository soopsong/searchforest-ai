in this work , we consider a two - level system ( tls ) coupled to a one - dimensional continuum of bosonic modes in a transmission line . using the master equation approach , a method for determining the photon number distribution of the scattered field is outlined . specifically , results for the reflected field when driving the tls with a coherent pulse are given . while the one - photon probability is enhanced compared to the incident coherent field , the system is still not a good deterministic single - photon source . extending the system to contain two separate transmission lines , however , output fields with one - photon probabilities close to unity can be reached .
