strong coupling between light and matter is possible with a variety of organic materials . in contrast to the simpler inorganic case , organic materials often have a complicated spectrum , with vibrationally dressed electronic transitions . strong coupling to light competes with this vibrational dressing , and if strong enough , can suppress the entanglement between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom . by exploiting symmetries , we can perform exact numerical diagonalization to find the polaritonic states for intermediate numbers of molecules , and use these to define and validate accurate expressions for the lower polariton states and strong - coupling spectrum in the thermodynamic limit . using this approach , we find that vibrational decoupling occurs as a sharp transition above a critical matter - light coupling strength . we also demonstrate how the polariton spectrum evolves with the number of molecules , recovering classical linear optics results only at large $ n$.
