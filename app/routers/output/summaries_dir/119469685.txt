we investigate the ballistic spreading behavior of the one - dimensional discrete time quantum walks whose time evolution is driven by any balanced quantum coin . we obtain closed - form expressions for the long - time variance of position of quantum walks starting from any initial qubit ( spin-$1/2 $ particle ) and position states following a delta - like ( local ) , gaussian and uniform probability distributions . by averaging over all spin states , we find out that the average variance of a quantum walk starting from a local state is independent of the quantum coin , while from gaussian and uniform states it depends on the sum of relative phases between spin states given by the quantum coin , being non - dispersive for a fourier walk and large initial dispersion . we also perform numerical simulations of the average probability distribution and variance along the time to compare them with our analytical results .
