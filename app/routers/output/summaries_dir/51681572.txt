the quantum capacity of a quantum channel captures its capability for noiseless quantum communication . it lies at the heart of quantum information theory . unfortunately , our poor understanding of nonadditivity of coherent information makes it hard to understand the quantum capacity of all but very special channels . in this paper , we consider the dephrasure channel , which is the concatenation of a dephasing channel and an erasure channel . this very simple channel displays remarkably rich and exotic properties : we find nonadditivity of coherent information at the two - letter level , a big gap between single - letter coherent and private informations , and positive quantum capacity for all complementary channels . its clean form simplifies the evaluation of coherent information substantially and , as such , we hope that the dephrasure channel will provide a much - needed laboratory for the testing of new ideas about nonadditivity .
