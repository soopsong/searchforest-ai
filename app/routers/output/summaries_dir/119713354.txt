a number of recent works employ bilinear hamiltonian interactions between linear quantum stochastic systems ( lqsss ) . contrary to naturally occurring hamiltonian interactions between physical systems , such interactions must be engineered . in this work , we propose a simple model for the implementation of an arbitrary bilinear interaction between two given lqsss via a feedback interconnection .
