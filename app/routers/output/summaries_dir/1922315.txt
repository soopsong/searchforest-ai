quantum computers promise to transform our notions of computation by offering a completely new paradigm . to achieve scalable quantum computation , optimizing compilers and a corresponding software design flow will be essential . we present a software architecture for compiling quantum programs from a high - level language program to hardware - specific instructions . we describe the necessary layers of abstraction and their differences and similarities to classical layers of a computer - aided design flow . for each layer of the stack , we discuss the underlying methods for compilation and optimization . our software methodology facilitates more rapid innovation among quantum algorithm designers , quantum hardware engineers , and experimentalists . it enables scalable compilation of complex quantum algorithms and can be targeted to any specific quantum hardware implementation .
