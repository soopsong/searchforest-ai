we present a method of directly obtaining the parity of a gaussian state of light without recourse to photon - number counting . the scheme uses only a simple balanced homodyne technique , and intensity correlation . thus interferometric schemes utilizing coherent or squeezed light , and parity detection may be practically implemented for an arbitrary photon flux . specifically we investigate a two - mode , squeezed - light , mach - zehnder interferometer and show how the parity of the output state may be obtained . we also show that the detection may be described independent of the parity operator , and that this"parity - by - proxy"measurement has the same signal as traditional parity .
