advanced measurement techniques and high performance computing have made large data sets available for a wide range of turbulent flows that arise in engineering applications . drawing on this abundance of data , dynamical models can be constructed to reproduce structural and statistical features of turbulent flows , opening the way to the design of effective model - based flow control strategies . this review describes a framework for completing second - order statistics of turbulent flows by models that are based on the navier - stokes equations linearized around the turbulent mean velocity . systems theory and convex optimization are combined to address the inherent uncertainty in the dynamics and the statistics of the flow by seeking a suitable parsimonious correction to the prior linearized model . specifically , dynamical couplings between states of the linearized model dictate structural constraints on the statistics of flow fluctuations . thence , colored - in - time stochastic forcing that drives the linearized model is sought to account for and reconcile dynamics with available data ( i.e. , partially known second order statistics ) . the number of dynamical degrees of freedom that are directly affected by stochastic excitation is minimized as a measure of model parsimony . the spectral content of the resulting colored - in - time stochastic contribution can alternatively be seen to arise from a low - rank structural perturbation of the linearized dynamical generator , pointing to suitable dynamical corrections that may account for the absence of the nonlinear interactions in the linearized model .
