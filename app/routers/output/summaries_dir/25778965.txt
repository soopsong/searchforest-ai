we study the large deviations of the magnetization at some finite time in the curie - weiss random field ising model with parallel updating . while relaxation dynamics in an infinite time horizon gives rise to unique dynamical trajectories ( specified by initial conditions and governed by first - order dynamics of the form $ m_{t+1}=f(m_t)$ ) , we observe that the introduction of a finite time horizon and the specification of terminal conditions can generate a host of metastable solutions obeying \textit{second - order } dynamics . we show that these solutions are governed by a newtonian - like dynamics in discrete time which permits solutions in terms of both the first order relaxation ( " forward " ) dynamics and the backward dynamics $ m_{t+1 } = f^{-1}(m_t)$. our approach allows us to classify trajectories for a given final magnetization as stable or metastable according to the value of the rate function associated with them . we find that in analogy to the freidlin - wentzell description of the stochastic dynamics of escape from metastable states , the dominant trajectories may switch between the two types ( forward and backward ) of first - order dynamics .
