we have studied entanglement between two dirac modes respectively observed by two independently accelerated observers . due to unruh effect , the entanglement degrades , but residual nonzero entanglement remains even when the accelerations of both observers are infinite . we have also investigated quantum teleportation using entangled dirac modes , and calculated the fidelities in various cases . in general , the fidelity depends on the single - qubit state $ \gamma|0\rangle + \delta|1\rangle$ to be teleported , as well as which bell state to use . in the limit that both accelerations are infinite , the average fidelity in using $ |\phi^\pm\rangle\equiv\frac{1}{2}(|00\rangle\pm |11\rangle ) $ is $ \frac{3}{4}$ , while that in using $ |\psi^\pm\rangle\equiv \frac{1}{2 } ( |01\rangle\pm |10\rangle ) $ is $ \frac{1}{2 } + |\gamma|^2 |\delta|^2$.
