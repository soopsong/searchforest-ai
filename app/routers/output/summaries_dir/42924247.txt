we investigate the effect of entanglement between two causally separated open charts in de sitter space on the spectrum of vacuum fluctuations . we consider a free massive scalar field , and construct the reduced density matrix by tracing out the vacuum state for one of the open charts , as recently derived by maldacena and pimentel . we formulate the mean - square vacuum fluctuations by using the reduced density matrix and show that the scale invariant spectrum of massless scalar field is realized on small scales . on the other hand , we find that the quantum entanglement affects the shape of the spectrum on large scales comparable to or greater than the curvature radius .
