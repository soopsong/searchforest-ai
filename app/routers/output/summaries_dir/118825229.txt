we discuss a model of quantum photosynthesis with degeneracy in the light - harvesting system . we consider interaction of excitons in chromophores with light and phonons ( vibrations of environment ) . these interactions have dipole form but are different ( are related to non - parallel vectors of"bright"states ) . we show that this leads to excitation of non - decaying"dark"states . we discuss relation of this model to the known from spectroscopical experiments phenomenon of existence of photonic echo in quantum photosynthesis .
