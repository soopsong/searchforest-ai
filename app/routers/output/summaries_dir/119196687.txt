higher order nonclassical properties of fields propagating through a codirectional asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler which is prepared by combining a linear wave guide and a nonlinear ( quadratic ) wave guide operated by second harmonic generation are studied . a completely quantum mechanical description is used here to describe the system . closed form analytic solutions of heisenberg 's equations of motion for various modes are used to show the existence of higher order antibunching , higher order squeezing , higher order two - mode and multi - mode entanglement in the asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler . it is also shown that nonclassical properties of light can transfer from a nonlinear wave guide to a linear wave guide .
