we present a distributed implementation of shor 's quantum factoring algorithm on a distributed quantum network model . this model provides a means for small capacity quantum computers to work together in such a way as to simulate a large capacity quantum computer . in this paper , entanglement is used as a resource for implementing non - local operations between two or more quantum computers . these non - local operations are used to implement a distributed factoring circuit with polynomially many gates . this distributed version of shor 's algorithm requires an additional overhead of o((log n)^2 ) communication complexity , where n denotes the integer to be factored .
