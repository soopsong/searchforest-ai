one of the main challenges in the field of quantum simulation and computation is to identify ways to certify the correct functioning of a device when a classical efficient simulation is not available . important cases are situations in which one can not classically calculate local expectation values of state preparations efficiently . in this work , we develop weak - membership formulations of the certification of ground state preparations . we provide a non - interactive protocol for certifying ground states of frustration - free hamiltonians based on simple energy measurements of local hamiltonian terms . this certification protocol can be applied to classically intractable analog quantum simulations : for example , using feynman - kitaev hamiltonians , one can encode universal quantum computation in such ground states . moreover , our certification protocol is applicable to ground states encodings of iqp circuits demonstration of quantum supremacy . these can be certified efficiently when the error is polynomially bounded .
