initialization , manipulation , and measurement of a three - spin qubit are demonstrated using a few - electron triple quantum dot , where all operations can be driven by tuning the nearest - neighbor exchange interaction . multiplexed reflectometry , applied to two nearby charge sensors , allows for qubit readout . decoherence is found to be consistent with predictions based on gate voltage noise with a uniform power spectrum . the theory of the exchange - only qubit is developed and it is shown that initialization of only two spins suffices for operation . requirements for full multi - qubit control using only exchange and electrostatic interactions are outlined .
