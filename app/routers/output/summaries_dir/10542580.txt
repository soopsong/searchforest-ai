in this paper we study the influence of dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction on quantum correlations in two qubit werner states and maximally entangled mixed states ( mems ) . we consider our system as a closed system of a qubits pair and one auxiliary qubit which interact with any one of the qubit of the pair through dm interaction . we show that dm interaction , taken along any direction ( x or y or z ) , does not affect two qubit werner states . on the other hand the mems are affected by x and z components of dm interaction and remain unaffected by the y component . further , we find that the state ( i.e probability amplitude ) of auxiliary qubit do not affect the quantum correlations in both the states , only dm interaction strength influences the quantum correlations . so one can avoid the intention to prepare the specific state of auxiliary qubit to manipulate the quantum correlations in both the states . we mention here that avoiding the preparation of state can contribute to cost reduction in quantum information processing . we also observe the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death in the present study .
