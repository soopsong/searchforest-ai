we consider a disordered quantum metamaterial formed by an array of superconducting flux qubits coupled to microwave photons in a cavity . we map the system on the tavis - cummings model accounting for the disorder in frequencies of the qubits . the complex transmittance is calculated with the parameters taken from state - of - the - art experiments . we demonstrate that photon phase shift measurements allow to distinguish individual resonances in the metamaterial with up to 100 qubits , in spite of the decoherence spectral width being remarkably larger than the effective coupling constant . our simulations are in agreement with the results of the recently reported experiment .
