two types of arguments concerning ( im)possibility of constructing a scalable , exponentially stable quantum memory equipped with hamiltonian controls are discussed . the first type concerns ergodic properties of open kitaev models which are considered as promising candidates for such memories . it is shown that , although the 4d kitaev model provides stable qubit observables , the hamiltonian control is not possible . the thermodynamical approach leads to the new proposal of the revised version of landauer 's principle and suggests that the existence of quantum memory implies the existence of the perpetuum mobile of the second kind . finally , a discussion of the stability property of information and its implications is presented .
