using a technique , analogous to coherent population trapping in an atomic system , we propose schemes to create transverse light propagation violating left - right symmetry in a photonic circuit consisting of three coupled waveguides . the frequency windows for the symmetry breaking of the left - right energy flow span over 80 nm . our proposed system only uses linear passive optical materials and is easy to integrate on a chip .
