we demonstrate a high - brightness source of pairs of indistinguishable photons based on a type - ii phase - matched doubly - resonant optical parametric oscillator operated far below threshold . the cavity - enhanced down - conversion output of a ppktp crystal is coupled into two single - mode fibers with a mode coupling efficiency of 58 % . the high degree of indistinguishability between the photons of a pair is demonstrated by a hong - ou - mandel interference visibility of higher than 90 % without any filtering at an instantaneous coincidence rate of 450 000 pairs / s per mw of pump power per nm of down - conversion bandwidth . for the degenerate spectral mode with a linewidth of 7 mhz at 795 nm a rate of 70 pairs/(s mw mhz ) is estimated , increasing the spectral brightness for indistinguishable photons by two orders of magnitude compared to similar previous sources .
