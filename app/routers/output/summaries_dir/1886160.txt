this paper concerns the recently proposed quasi - balanced truncation model reduction method for linear quantum stochastic systems . it has previously been shown that the quasi - balanceable class of systems ( i.e. systems that can be truncated via the quasi - balanced method ) includes the class of completely passive systems . in this work , we refine the previously established characterization of quasi - balanceable systems and show that the class of quasi - balanceable systems is strictly larger than the class of completely passive systems . in particular , we derive a novel characterization of completely passive linear quantum stochastic systems solely in terms of the controllability gramian of such systems . exploiting this result , we prove that all linear quantum stochastic systems with a pure gaussian steady - state ( active systems included ) are all quasi - balanceable , and establish a new complete parameterization for this important class of systems . examples are provided to illustrate our results .
