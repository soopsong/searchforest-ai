the unruh effect refers to the thermal fluctuations a detector experiences while undergoing linear motion with uniform acceleration in a minkowski vacuum . this thermality can be demonstrated by tracing the vacuum state of the field over the modes beyond the accelerated detector 's event horizon . however , the event horizon is well - defined only if the detector moves with eternal uniform linear acceleration . this idealized condition can not be fulfilled in realistic situations when the motion unavoidably involves periods of non - uniform acceleration . many experimental proposals to test the unruh effect are of this nature . often circular or oscillatory motion , which lacks an obvious geometric description , is considered in such proposals . the proper perspective for theoretically going beyond , or experimentally testing , the unruh - hawking effect in these more general conditions has to be offered by concepts and techniques in non - equilibrium quantum field theory . in this paper we provide a detailed analysis of how an unruh - dewitt detector undergoing oscillatory motion responds to the fluctuations of a quantum field . numerical results for the late - time temperatures of the oscillating detector are presented . we comment on the digressions of these results from what one would obtain from a naive application of unruh 's result .
