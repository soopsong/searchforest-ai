in nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) quantum computation , the selective control of multiple homonuclear spins is usually slow because their resonance frequencies are very close to each other . to quickly implement controls against decoherence effects , this paper presents an efficient numerical algorithm fordesigning minimum - time local transformations in two homonuclear spins . we obtain an accurate minimum - time estimation via geometric analysis on the two - timescale decomposition of the dynamics . such estimation narrows down the range of search for the minimum - time control with a gradient - type optimization algorithm . numerical simulations show that this method can remarkably reduce the search efforts , especially when the frequency difference is very small and the control field is high . its effectiveness is further demonstrated by nmr experiments with two homunuclear carbon spins in a trichloroethylene ( c2h1cl3 ) sample system .
