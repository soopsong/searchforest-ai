human beings do not observe the world from the outside , but rather are fully embedded in it . the sciences , however , often give the observer both a"god 's eye"perspective and substantial a ~ priori knowledge . motivated by w. ross ashby 's statement,"the theory of the black box is merely the theory of real objects or systems , when close attention is given to the question , relating object and observer , about what information comes from the object , and how it is obtained"(introduction to cybernetics , 1956 , p. 110 ) , i develop here an alternate picture of the world as a black box to which the observer is coupled . within this framework i prove purely - classical analogs of the"no - go"theorems of quantum theory . focussing on the question of identifying macroscopic objects , such as laboratory apparatus or even other observers , i show that the standard quantum formalism of superposition is required to adequately represent the classical information that an observer can obtain . i relate these results to supporting considerations from evolutionary biology , cognitive and developmental psychology , and artificial intelligence .
