three types of numerical data are provided for simple lie groups of any type and rank . this data is indispensable for fourier - like expansions of multidimensional digital data into finite series of $ c-$ or $ s-$functions on the fundamental domain $ f$ of the underlying lie group $ g$. firstly , we consider the number $ |f_m|$ of points in $ f$ from the lattice $ p^{\vee}_m$ , which is the refinement of the dual weight lattice $ p^{\vee}$ of $ g$ by a positive integer $ m$. secondly , we find the lowest set $ \lambda_m$ of dominant weights , specifying the maximal set of $ c-$ and $ s-$functions that are pairwise orthogonal on the point set $ f_m$. finally , we describe an efficient algorithm for finding , on the maximal torus of $ g$ , the number of conjugate points to every point of $ f_m$. discrete $ c-$ and $ s-$transforms , together with their continuous interpolations , are presented in full generality .
