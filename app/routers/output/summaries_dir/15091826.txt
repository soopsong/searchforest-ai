optical nanofibers confine light to subwavelength scales , and are of interest for the design , integration , and interconnection of nanophotonic devices . here we demonstrate high transmission ( > 97 % ) of the first family of excited modes through a 350 nm radius fiber , by appropriate choice of the fiber and precise control of the taper geometry . we can design the nanofibers so that these modes propagate with most of their energy outside the waist region . we also present an optical setup for selectively launching these modes with less than 1 % fundamental mode contamination . our experimental results are in good agreement with simulations of the propagation . multimode optical nanofibers expand the photonic toolbox , and may aid in the realization of a fully integrated nanoscale device for communication science , laser science or other sensing applications .
