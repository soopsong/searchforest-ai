we develop a method to find analytical solutions for the eigenstates of the quantum rabi model . these include symmetric , anti - symmetric and asymmetric analytic solutions given in terms of the confluent heun functions . both regular and exceptional solutions are given in a unified form . in addition , the analytic conditions for determining the energy spectrum are obtained . our results show that conditions proposed by braak [ phys . rev . lett . \textbf{107 } , 100401 ( 2011 ) ] are a type of sufficiency condition for determining the regular solutions . the well - known judd isolated exact solutions appear naturally as truncations of the confluent heun functions .
