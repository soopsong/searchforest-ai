we present a hyperconcentration scheme for nonlocal $ n$-photon hyperentangled greenberger - horne - zeilinger states . the maximally hyperentangled state , in which $ n$ particles are entangled simultaneously in the polarization and the spatial mode , can be obtained with a certain probability from two partially hyperentangled states . the hyperconcentration scheme is based on one polarization parity check measurement , one spatial mode parity check measurement and n-2 single - photon two - qubit measurements . the concentration only requires linear optical elements , which makes it feasible and practical with current technology .
