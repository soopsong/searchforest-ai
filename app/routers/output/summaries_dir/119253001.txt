we study the fast transport of a particle or a bose - einstein condensate in a harmonic potential . an exact expression for the final excitation energy in terms of the fourier transform of the trap acceleration is used to engineer optimal transport protocols ( with no final excitation ) that are robust with respect to spring - constant errors . the same technique provides a way to design the simultaneous and robust transport of a few non - interacting species that experience different harmonic trap frequencies in the same trap .
