quantifying the contraction of classical and quantum states under noisy channels is an important topic in the information theory . among various techniques , the strong data processing inequality , as a refinement of the well - known data processing inequality , has lately received much attention for classical noisy channels . in this work , we apply the strong data processing inequality to study quantum noisy channels and under certain assumptions , we prove the tensorization of the strong data processing inequality for a family of quantum chi - square divergences . in addition , we discuss the connection between the quantum strong data processing inequality constant and the quantum maximal correlation .
