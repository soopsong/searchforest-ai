as the practical quantum computing platforms ( qcps ) rapidly become a reality , it is desirable to harness their true potential in software applications . thus it becomes important to determine the implications of qcps for software architecture . in this paper we present the in - depth examination of state - of - the - art qcps for identifying all such characteristics of a qcp that are relevant from software architecture perspective . lack of a native quantum operating system , a hard dependency on quantum algorithms , the lower level of programming abstractions are few , out of many , examples of qcp characteristics which may affect architecture of quantum software applications . key contributions of this paper include identifying : i ) the general architecture of a qcp , ii ) the programming model which is typically used when developing software for a qcp , iii ) architecturally significant characteristics of qcps and iv ) the impact of these characteristics on various quality attributes ( qas ) . we show that except performance and scalability , most of the other qas ( e.g. maintainability , testability , reliability etc . ) are adversely affected by different characteristics of a qcp .
