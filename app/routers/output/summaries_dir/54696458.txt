we propose a scheme to tailor nanostructured trapping potentials for ultracold atoms . our trapping scheme combines an engineered extension of repulsive optical dipole forces at short distances and attractive casimir - polder forces at long distances between an atom and a nanostructured surface . this extended dipole force takes advantage of excited - state dressing by plasmonically - enhanced intensity to doubly dress the ground state and create a strongly repulsive potential with spatially tunable characteristics . in this work , we show that , under realistic experimental conditions , this method can be used to trap rubidium atoms close to surfaces ( tens of nanometers ) or to realize nanostructured lattices with subwavelength periods . the influence of the various losses and heating rate mechanism in such traps is characterized . as an example we present a near - field optical lattice with 100 nm period and study the tunability of lattice and trapping depths . such lattices can enhance energy scales with interesting perspectives for the simulation of strongly - correlated physics . our method can be extended to other atomic species and to other near - field hybrid systems where a strong atom - light interaction can be expected .
