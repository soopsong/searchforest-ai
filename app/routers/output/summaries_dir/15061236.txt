the router is a key element for a network . we describe a scheme to realize genuine quantum routing of single - photon pulses based on cascading of conditional quantum gates in a mach - zehnder interferometer and report a proof - of - principle experiment for its demonstration using linear optics quantum gates . the polarization of the control photon routes in a coherent way the path of the signal photon while preserving the qubit state of the signal photon represented by its polarization . we demonstrate quantum nature of this router by showing entanglement generated between the initially unentangled control and signal photons , and confirm that the qubit state of the signal photon is well preserved by the router through quantum process tomography .
