we report on the generation of an indistinguishable heralded single - photon state , using highly nondegenerate spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) . spectrally factorable photon pairs can be generated by incorporating a broadband pump pulse and a group - velocity matching ( gvm ) condition in a periodically - poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ppktp ) crystal . the heralding photon is in the near ir , close to the peak detection efficiency of off - the - shelf si single - photon detectors ; meanwhile , the heralded photon is in the telecom l - band where fiber losses are at a minimum . we observe spectral factorability of the spdc source and consequently high purity ( 90 % ) of the produced heralded single photons by several different techniques . because this source can also realize a high heralding efficiency ( > 90 % ) , it would be suitable for time - multiplexing techniques , enabling a pseudo - deterministic single - photon source , a critical resource for optical quantum information and communication technology .
