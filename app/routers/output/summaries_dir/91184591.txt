the sachdev - ye - kitaev ( syk ) model can be used to describe black holes ( bhs ) in two - dimensional nearly - anti - de - sitter gravity . we show that when such bhs are perturbed by a time - dependent negative - energy perturbation , their interior can be partially revealed . in the syk model , a partial measurement of the state of the majorana fermion pairs allows one to construct a matching time - dependent negative - energy perturbation of the bh geometry that shifts the state of the bh away from its equilibrium state . kourkoulou and maldacena showed that , if the perturbation is strong enough , the interior can be fully exposed and the bh disappears . here , we show that when the perturbation is weaker than the threshold for full exposure , it effectively moves the horizon of the bh inwards , thus partially exposing the interior of the bh and leaving behind a smaller bh . the exposure is in proportion to the number of measured majorana pairs and so also in proportion to the magnitude of the energy of the perturbation . from the boundary , the partial measurement is perceived as a burst of radiation whose strength and duration are proportional to the number of measured majorana pairs .
