we propose a hybrid optomechanical quantum system consisting of a moving membrane strongly coupled to an ensemble of n atoms with a rydberg state . due to the strong van - der - waals interaction between the atoms , the ensemble forms an effective two - level system , a rydberg superatom , with a collectively enhanced atom - light coupling . using this superatom imposed collective enhancement strong coupling between membrane and superatom is feasible for parameters within the range of current experiments . the quantum interface to couple the membrane and the superatom can be a pumped single mode cavity , or a laser field in free space , where the rydberg superatom and the membrane are spatially separated . in addition to the coherent dynamics , we study in detail the impact of the typical dissipation processes , in particular the radiative decay as a source for incoherent superpositions of atomic excitations . we identify the conditions to suppress these incoherent dynamics and thereby a parameter regime for strong coupling . the rydberg superatom in this hybrid system serves as a toolbox for the nanomechanical resonator allowing for a wide range of applications such as state transfer , sympathetic cooling and non - classical state preparation . as an illustration , we show that a thermally occupied membrane can be prepared in a non - classical state without the necessity of ground state cooling .
