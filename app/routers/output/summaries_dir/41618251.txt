it is well understood that the use of quantum entanglement significantly enhances the computational power of systems . much of the attention has focused on bell states and their multipartite generalizations . however , in the multipartite case it is known that there are several inequivalent classes of states , such as those represented by the w - state and the ghz - state . our main contribution is a demonstration of the special computational power of these states in the context of paradigmatic problems from classical distributed computing . concretely , we show that the w - state is the only pure state that can be used to exactly solve the problem of leader election in anonymous quantum networks . similarly we show that the ghz - state is the only one that can be used to solve the problem of distributed consensus when no classical post - processing is considered . these results generalize to a family of w- and ghz - like states . at the heart of the proofs of these impossibility results lie symmetry arguments .
