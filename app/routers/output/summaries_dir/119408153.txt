we formulate a general family of entanglement criteria for multipartite systems . fisher information criteria compare the sensitivity to unitary rotations with the variances of suitable local observables . generalized squeezing - type criteria provide lower bounds that are less stringent but only require measurements of second moments . the enhancement due to local access to the individual subsystems is studied in detail for the case of $ n$ spin-$1/2 $ particles . the discussed techniques can be readily implemented in current experiments with trapped ions in paul traps and neutral atoms in optical lattices .
