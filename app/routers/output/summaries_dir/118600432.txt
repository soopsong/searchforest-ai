many phenomena of strongly correlated materials are encapsulated in the fermi - hubbard model whose thermodynamical properties can be computed from its grand canonical potential according to standard procedures . in general , there is no closed form solution for lattices of more than one spatial dimension , but solutions can be approximated with cluster perturbation theory . to model long - range effects such as order parameters , a powerful method to compute the cluster 's green 's function consists in finding its self - energy through a variational principle of the grand canonical potential . this opens the possibility of studying various phase transitions at finite temperature in the fermi - hubbard model . however , a classical cluster solver quickly hits an exponential wall in the memory ( or computation time ) required to store the computation variables . here it is shown theoretically that that the cluster solver can be mapped to a subroutine on a quantum computer whose quantum memory scales as the number of orbitals in the simulated cluster . a quantum computer with a few tens of qubits could therefore simulate the thermodynamical properties of complex fermionic lattices inaccessible to classical supercomputers .
