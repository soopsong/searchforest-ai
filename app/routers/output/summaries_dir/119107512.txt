quantum information can be encoded in the set of steady - states ( sss ) of a driven - dissipative system . non steady - states are separated by a large dissipative gap that adiabatically decouples them way while the dynamics inside the sss is governed by an effective , dissipation - projected , hamiltonian . the latter results from a highly non - trivial interplay between a weak driving with the fast relaxation process that continuously projects the system back to the sss . this amounts to a novel type of environment - induced quantum zeno effect . we prove that the dissipation - projected dynamics is of geometric nature and that it is robust against different types of hamiltonian and dissipative perturbations . remarkably , in some cases an effective unitary dynamics can emerge out of purely dissipative interactions .
