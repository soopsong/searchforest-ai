in this paper we present a markovian representation approach to constructing quantum filters for a class of non - markovian quantum systems disturbed by lorenztian noise . an ancillary system is introduced to convert white noise into lorentzian noise which is injected into a principal system via a direct interaction . the resulting dynamics of the principal system are non - markovian , which are driven by the lorentzian noise . by probing the principal system , a quantum filter for the augmented system can be derived from standard theory , where the conditional state of the principal system can be obtained by tracing out the ancillary system . an example is provided to illustrate the non - markovian dynamics of the principal system .
