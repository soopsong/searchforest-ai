in this paper , we present a unified computational method based on pseudospectral approximations for the design of optimal pulse sequences in open quantum systems . the proposed method transforms the problem of optimal pulse design , which is formulated as a continuous time optimal control problem , to a finite dimensional constrained nonlinear programming problem . this resulting optimization problem can then be solved using existing numerical optimization suites . we apply the legendre pseudospectral method to a series of optimal control problems on open quantum systems that arise in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy in liquids . these problems have been well studied in previous literature and analytical optimal controls have been found . we find an excellent agreement between the maximum transfer efficiency produced by our computational method and the analytical expressions . moreover , our method permits us to extend the analysis and address practical concerns , including smoothing discontinuous controls as well as deriving minimum energy controls . the method is not restricted to the systems studied in this article but is universal to every open quantum system whose performance is limited by dissipation .
