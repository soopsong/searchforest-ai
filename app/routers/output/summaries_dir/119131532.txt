we analyze the concept of entanglement for multipartite system with bosonic and fermionic constituents and its generalization to systems with arbitrary parastatistics . we use the representation theory of symmetry groups to formulate a unified approach to this problem in terms of simple tensors with appropriate symmetry . for an arbitrary parastatistics , we define the s - rank generalizing the notion of the schmidt rank . the s - rank , defined for all types of tensors , serves for distinguishing entanglement of pure states . in addition , for bose and fermi statistics , we construct an analog of the jamiolkowski isomorphism .
