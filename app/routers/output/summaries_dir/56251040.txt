we use the unruh effect to analyze the dynamics of classical and quantum correlations for a two - qubit system when one of them is uniformly accelerated for a finite amount of proper time . we show that the quantum correlation is completely destroyed in the limit of infinite acceleration , while the classical one remains nonzero . in particular , we show that such correlations exhibit the so - called sudden - change behavior as a function of acceleration . eventually , we discuss how our results can be interpreted when the system lies in the vicinity of the event horizon of a schwarzschild black hole .
