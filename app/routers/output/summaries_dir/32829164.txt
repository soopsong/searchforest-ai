we present a detailed analysis of the multimode quantum state embedded in an optical frequency comb generated by a synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator ( spopo ) . the full covariance matrix of the state is obtained with homodyne detection where the local oscillator is spectrally controlled with pulse shaping techniques . the resulting matrix reveals genuine multipartite entanglement . additionally , the beam is comprised of several independent eigenmodes that correspond to specific pulse shapes . the experimental data is confirmed with numerical simulations . finally , the potential to create continuous - variable cluster states from the quantum comb is analyzed . multiple cluster states are shown to be simultaneously embedded in the spopo state , and these states can be revealed by a suitable basis change applied to the measured covariance matrix .
