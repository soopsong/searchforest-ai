the pseudomode approach is discussed with an emphasis to gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan - lindblad form of this approach . the connection of the pseudomode approach with solutions of both the friedrichs model and jaynes - cummings model with dissipation at zero temperature is shown . the obtained results are applied to non - markovian phenomena description in the fenna - matthews - olson complexes , estimations based on experimental data are done . a deformation approach to generalization of the pseudomode approach to the finite - temperature case is discussed .
