we have studied theoretically the electron spin relaxation in semiconductor quantum dots via interaction with nuclear spins . the relaxation is shown to be determined by three processes : ( i ) -- the precession of the electron spin in the hyperfine field of the frozen fluctuation of the nuclear spins ; ( ii ) -- the precession of the nuclear spins in the hyperfine field of the electron ; and ( iii ) -- the precession of the nuclear spin in the dipole field of its nuclear neighbors . in external magnetic fields the relaxation of electron spins directed along the magnetic field is suppressed . electron spins directed transverse to the magnetic field relax completely in a time on the order of the precession period of its spin in the field of the frozen fluctuation of the nuclear spins . comparison with experiment shows that the hyperfine interaction with nuclei may be the dominant mechanism of electron spin relaxation in quantum dots .
