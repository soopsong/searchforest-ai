third - order nonlinear processes require phase matching between the interacting fields to achieve high efficiencies . typically in guided - wave $ \chi^{(3)}$ platforms this is achieved by engineering the dispersion of the modes through the transverse profile of the device . however , this limits the flexibility of the phase matching that can be achieved . instead , we analyze four - wave mixing in a pair of asymmetric waveguides and show that phasematching may be achieved in any $ \chi^{(3)}$ waveguide by coupling of a nondegenerate pump from an adjacent waveguide . we demonstrate the additional flexibility that this approach yields in the case of photon - pair generation by spontaneous fwm , where the supermode dispersion may be modified to produce pure heralded single photons -- a critical capability required for example by silicon platforms for chip - scale quantum photonics .
