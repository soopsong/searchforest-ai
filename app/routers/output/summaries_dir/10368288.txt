the paper highlights the role of a positive feedback gating mechanism at the cellular level in the robust- ness and modulation properties of rhythmic activities at the circuit level . the results are presented in the context of half - center oscillators , which are simple rhythmic circuits composed of two reciprocally connected inhibitory neuronal populations . specifically , we focus on rhythms that rely on a particu- lar excitability property , the post - inhibitory rebound , an intrinsic cellular property that elicits transient membrane depolarization when released from hyperpolarization . two distinct ionic currents can evoke this transient depolarization : a hyperpolarization - activated cation current and a low - threshold t - type calcium current . the presence of a slow activation is specific to the t - type calcium current and provides a slow - positive feedback at the cellular level that is absent in the cation current . we show that this slow- positive feedback is necessary and sufficient to endow the network rhythm with physiological modulation and robustness properties . this study thereby identifies an essential cellular property to be retained at the network level in modeling network robustness and modulation .
