the radiation pressure induced coupling between an optical cavity field and a mechanical oscillator can create entanglement between them . in previous works this entanglement was treated as that of the quantum fluctuations of the cavity and mechanical modes around their classical mean values . here we provide a fully quantum approach to optomechanical entanglement , which goes beyond the approximation of classical mean motion plus quantum fluctuation , and applies to arbitrary cavity drive . we illustrate the real - time evolution of optomechanical entanglement under drive of arbitrary detuning to show the existence of high , robust and stable entanglement in blue detuned regime , and highlight the quantum noise effects that can cause entanglement sudden death and revival .
