the ability to generalize is an important feature of any intelligent agent . not only because it may allow the agent to cope with large amounts of data , but also because in some environments , an agent with no generalization capabilities can not learn . in this work we outline several criteria for generalization , and present a dynamic and autonomous machinery that enables projective simulation agents to meaningfully generalize . projective simulation , a novel , physical approach to artificial intelligence , was recently shown to perform well in standard reinforcement learning problems , with applications in advanced robotics as well as quantum experiments . both the basic projective simulation model and the presented generalization machinery are based on very simple principles . this allows us to provide a full analytical analysis of the agent 's performance and to illustrate the benefit the agent gains by generalizing . specifically , we show that already in basic ( but extreme ) environments , learning without generalization may be impossible , and demonstrate how the presented generalization machinery enables the projective simulation agent to learn .
