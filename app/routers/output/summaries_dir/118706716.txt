we show that the restricted sharability and distribution of multi - qubit entanglement can be characterized by tsallis-$q$ entropy . we first provide a class of bipartite entanglement measures named tsallis-$q$ entanglement , and provide its analytic formula in two - qubit systems for $ 1 \leq q \leq 4$. for $ 2 \leq q \leq 3 $ , we show a monogamy inequality of multi - qubit entanglement in terms of tsallis-$q$ entanglement , and we also provide a polygamy inequality using tsallis-$q$ entropy for $ 1 \leq q \leq 2 $ and $ 3 \leq q \leq 4$.
