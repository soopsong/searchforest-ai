representations of spin groups and clifford algebras derived from structure of qubit trees are introduced in this work . for ternary trees the construction is more general and reduction to binary trees is formally defined by deleting of superfluous branches . usual jordan - wigner construction also may be formally obtained in such approach by bringing the process up to trivial qubit chain ( " trunk " ) . the methods can be also used for effective simulations of some quantum circuits corresponding to the binary tree structure .
