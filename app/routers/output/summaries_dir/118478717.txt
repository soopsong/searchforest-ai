we present a fully analytically solvable family of models with many - body cluster interaction and ising interaction . this family exhibits two phases , dubbed cluster and ising phases , respectively . the critical point turns out to be independent of the cluster size $ n+2 $ and is reached exactly when both interactions are equally weighted . for even $ n$ we prove that the cluster phase corresponds to a nematic ordered phase and in the case of odd $ n$ to a symmetry protected topological ordered phase . though complex , we are able to quantify the multi - particle entanglement content of neighboring spins . we prove that there exists no bipartite or , in more detail , no $ n+1$-partite entanglement . this is possible since the non - trivial symmetries of the hamiltonian restrict the state space . indeed , only if the ising interaction is strong enough ( local ) genuine $ n+2$-partite entanglement is built up . due to their analytically solvableness the $ n$-cluster - ising models serve as a prototype for studying non trivial - spin orderings and due to their peculiar entanglement properties they serve as a potential reference system for the performance of quantum information tasks .
