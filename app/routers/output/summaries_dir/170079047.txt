the efficient certification of nonclassical effects of light forms the basis for applications in optical quantum technologies . we derive general correlation conditions for the verification of nonclassical light based on multiplexed detection . the obtained nonclassicality criteria are valid for imperfectly - balanced multiplexing scenarios with on - off detectors and do not require any knowledge about the detector system . in this sense they are fully independent of the detector system . in our experiment , we study light emitted by clusters of single - photon emitters , whose photon number may exceed the number of detection channels . even under such conditions , our criteria certify nonclassicality with high statistical significance .
