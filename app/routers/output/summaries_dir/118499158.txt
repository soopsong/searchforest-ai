we introduce a modular - value two - qubit gate and explore its advantages in experimentally - limited situations . the gate is defined such that the final state of a target qubit is fully controlled by a pre- and post - selection procedure in a control qubit given an ( imperfect or technically limited ) intermediate conditional qubit - qubit interaction . as an example of the gate and its benefit , we make the connection to a postselected cross phase modulation scenario when a undesired absorption is present . probabilistic amplification of a small cross phase while mitigating relative absorption is possible , and a complementary behaviour between phase and amplitude emerges .
