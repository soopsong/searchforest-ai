we propose a scheme for implementing the cnot gate over qubits encoded in a pair of electron spins in a double quantum dot . the scheme is based on exchange and spin orbit interactions and on local gradients in zeeman fields . we find that the optimal device geometry for this implementation involves effective magnetic fields that are parallel to the symmetry axis of the spin orbit interaction . we show that the switching times for the cnot gate can be as fast as a few nanoseconds for realistic parameter values in gaas semiconductors . guided by recent advances in surface codes , we also consider the perpendicular geometry . in this case , leakage errors due to spin orbit interaction occur but can be suppressed in strong magnetic fields .
