we present two complete maximally hyperentangled state analysis protocols for photons entangled in the polarization and spatial - mode degrees of freedom . the first protocol is a hyperentangled bell state analysis scheme for two photons and the second is a hyperentangled greenberger - horne- zeilinger ( ghz ) state analysis scheme for three photons . in each scheme , a set of mutually orthogonal hyperentangled basis states are completely and deterministically discriminated with the aid of cross - kerr nonlinearities and linear optics . we also generalize the schemes to unambiguously analyze the n - photon hyperentangled ghz state . compared with previous protocols , our schemes greatly simplify the discrimination process and reduce the requirements on nonlinearities by using the measured spatial - mode state to assist in the analysis of the polarization state . these advantages make our schemes useful for practical applications in long - distance high capacity quantum communication .
