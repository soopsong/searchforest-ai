some two qubit interactions are singly sufficient for universal quantum computation but not without the use of an ancilla . recent schemes for universal quantum computation have focused on hybrid physical systems using ancillae . in them , the application of resources is shifted to the ancilla system . we consider which 2-qubit interactions are universal in ancilla schemes where direct connections between main register qubits are forbidden . by the use of ancilla driven operations and repeat - until - success style random gates , a single fixed symmetric gate can be universal be control of the number of repetitions alone .
