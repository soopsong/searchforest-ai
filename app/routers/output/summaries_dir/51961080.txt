we propose a method of constructing the separability criteria for multipartite quantum states on the basis of entanglement witnesses . the entanglement witnesses are obtained by finding the maximal expectation values of hermitian operators and then optimizing over all possible hermitian operators . we derive a set of tripartite separability criteria for the four - qubit greenberger -- horne -- zeilinger ( ghz ) diagonal states . the derived criterion set contains four criteria that are necessary and sufficient for the tripartite separability of the highly symmetric four - qubit ghz diagonal states ; the criteria completely account for the numerically obtained boundaries of the tripartite separable state set . one of the criteria is just the tripartite separability criterion of the four - qubit generalized werner states .
