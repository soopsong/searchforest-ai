quantum networks promise to revolutionise computing , simulation , and communication . light is the ideal information carrier for quantum networks , as its properties are not degraded by noise in ambient conditions , and it can support large bandwidths enabling fast operations and a large information capacity . quantum memories , devices that store , manipulate , and release on demand quantum light , have been identified as critical components of photonic quantum networks , because they facilitate scalability . however , any noise introduced by the memory can render the device classical by destroying the quantum character of the light . here we introduce an intrinsically noise - free memory protocol based on two - photon off - resonant cascaded absorption ( orca ) . we consequently demonstrate for the first time successful storage of ghz - bandwidth heralded single photons in a warm atomic vapour with no added noise ; confirmed by the unaltered photon statistics upon recall . our orca memory platform meets the stringent noise - requirements for quantum memories whilst offering technical simplicity and high - speed operation , and therefore is immediately applicable to low - latency quantum networks .
