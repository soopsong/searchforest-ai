semi - classical gravity is an approximation to quantum gravity where gravity is treated classically and matter quantum mechanically . matter is described by quantum field theory on curved space - time , whereas gravity is described by a space - time metric which satisfies einstein 's field equations . in the usual approach to semi - classical gravity , the matter source term in einstein 's field equations is given by the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor operator . in this paper , we suggest an alternative approach based on bohmian mechanics . in bohmian mechanics , a quantum system is described by an actual configuration ( e.g. , an actual scalar field ) , which evolves under the influence of the wave function . the idea is to consider the actual energy - momentum tensor corresponding to this configuration as the matter source term in einstein 's field equations . this approach is expected to improve upon the usual approach .
