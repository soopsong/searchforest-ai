we demonstrate frequency - bin entanglement between ultra - narrowband photons generated by cavity enhanced spontaneous parametric down conversion . our source generates photon pairs in widely non - degenerate discrete frequency modes , with one photon resonant with a quantum memory material based on praseodymium doped crystals and the other photon at telecom wavelengths . correlations between the frequency modes are analyzed using phase modulators and narrowband filters before detection . we show high - visibility two photon interference between the frequency modes , allowing us to infer a coherent superposition of the modes . we develop a model describing the state that we create and use it to estimate optimal measurements to achieve a violation of the clauser - horne ( ch ) bell inequality under realistic assumptions . with these settings we perform a bell test and show a significant violation of the ch inequality , thus proving the entanglement of the photons . finally we demonstrate the compatibility with a quantum memory material by using a spectral hole in the praseodymium ( pr ) doped crystal as spectral filter for measuring high - visibility two - photon interference . this demonstrates the feasibility of combining frequency - bin entangled photon pairs with pr - based solid state quantum memories .
