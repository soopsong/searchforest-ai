according to the laws of thermodynamics , no heat engine can beat the efficiency of a carnot cycle . this efficiency traditionally comes with vanishing power output and practical designs , optimized for power , generally achieve far less . recently , various strategies to obtain carnot 's efficiency at large power were proposed . however , a thermodynamic uncertainty relation implies that steady - state heat engines can operate in this regime only at the cost of large fluctuations that render them immensely unreliable . here , we demonstrate that this unfortunate trade - off can be overcome by designs operating cyclically under quasi - static conditions . the experimentally relevant yet exactly solvable model of an overdamped brownian heat engine is used to illustrate the formal result . our study highlights that work in cyclic heat engines and that in quasi - static ones are different stochastic processes .
