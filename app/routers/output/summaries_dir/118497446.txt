the work presented here extends upon the best known universal quantum circuit , the quantum shannon decomposition proposed in [ vivek v. shende , stephen s. bullock and igor markov , synthesis of quantum logic circuits , ieee trans . comput.-aided des . integr . circuits syst . 25 ( 6 ) : 1000 - 1010 ( 2006 ) ] . we obtain the basis of the circuit 's design in a pair of cartan decompositions . this insight gives a simple constructive algorithm for obtaining the quantum shannon decomposition of a given unitary matrix in terms of the corresponding cartan involutions .
