complexity of a quantum analogue of the satisfiability problem is studied . quantum k - sat is a problem of verifying whether there exists n - qubit pure state such that its k - qubit reduced density matrices have support on prescribed subspaces . we present a classical algorithm solving quantum 2-sat in a polynomial time . it generalizes the well - known algorithm for the classical 2-sat . besides , we show that for any k>=4 quantum k - sat is complete in the complexity class qma with one - sided error .
