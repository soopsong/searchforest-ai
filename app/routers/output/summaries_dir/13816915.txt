in ( d+1 ) dimensional multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) networks , tensors are connected so as to reproduce the discrete , ( d + 2 ) holographic geometry of anti de sitter space ( adsd+2 ) with the original system lying at the boundary . we analyze the mera renormalization flow that arises when computing the quantum correlations between two disjoint blocks of a quantum critical system , to show that the structure of the causal cones characteristic of mera , requires a transition between two different regimes attainable by changing the ratio between the size and the separation of the two disjoint blocks . we argue that this transition in the mera causal developments of the blocks may be easily accounted by an adsd+2 black hole geometry when the mutual information is computed using the ryu - takayanagi formula . as an explicit example , we use a btz ads3 black hole to compute the mi and the quantum correlations between two disjoint intervals of a one dimensional boundary critical system . our results for this low dimensional system not only show the existence of a phase transition emerging when the conformal four point ratio reaches a critical value but also provide an intuitive entropic argument accounting for the source of this instability . we discuss the robustness of this transition when finite temperature and finite size effects are taken into account .
