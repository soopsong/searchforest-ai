we argue that the fermi - hubbard hamiltonian describing the physics of ultracold atoms on optical lattices in the presence of artificial non - abelian gauge fields , is exactly equivalent to the gauge theory hamiltonian describing dirac fermions in the lattice . we show that it is possible to couple the dirac fermions to an"artificial"gravitational field , i.e. to consider the dirac physics in a curved spacetime . we identify the special class of spacetime metrics that admit a simple realization in terms of a fermi - hubbard model subjected to an artificial su(2 ) field , corresponding to position dependent hopping matrices . as an example , we discuss in more detail the physics of the 2 + 1d rindler metric , its possible experimental realization and detection .
