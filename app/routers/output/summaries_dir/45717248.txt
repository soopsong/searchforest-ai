we investigate quantum synchronization phenomenon within the complex network constituted by coupled optomechanical systems and prove the unknown identical quantum states can be shared or distributed in the quantum network even though the topology is varying . considering a channel constructed by quantum correlation , we show that quantum synchronization can sustain and maintain high levels in markovian dissipation for a long time . we analyze state sharing process between two typical complex networks , that is , a small - world network corresponding to linear motif state sharing and a scale - free network corresponding to whole network sharing , respectively . our results predict that linked nodes can be directly synchronized in small - world network , but the whole network will be synchronized only if some specific synchronization conditions are satisfied . furthermore , we give the synchronization conditions analytically through analyzing network dynamics . this proposal paves the way for studying multi - interaction synchronization and achieving an effective quantum information processing in complex network .
