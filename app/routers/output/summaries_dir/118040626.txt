the basic motivation behind this work is to raise the question that whether post selection can be considered a valid physical transformation ( on probability space ) or not . we study the consequences of both answers set in a device ( theory ) independent framework , based only on observed statistics . we start with taking up post - selection as an assumption and model the same using independent devices governed by boolean functions . we establish analogy between the post selection functions and the general probabilistic games in a two party binary input - output scenario . as an observation , we categorize all possible post - selection functions based on the effect on a uniform input probability distribution . we find that post - selection can transform simple no signaling probability distributions to signaling . similarly , solving np complete problems is easy independent of classical or quantum computation ( in particular we prove that post rp = np ) . finally , we demonstrate an instance of the violation of the pigeon hole principle independent of underlying theory . as result of our theory independent modeling we conclude that post - selection as an assumption adds power to the underlying theory . in particular , quantum mechanics benefits more with the post - selection assumption , only because it admits a more general set of allowed probabilities as compared to the local hidden variable model . without the assumption we associate a device independent efficiency factor to quantify the cost of post selection . our study shows that in the real world post - selection is not efficient enough to be of any advantage . but from an adversarial perspective it is still of significance . as an application , we obtain robust bounds on faking the bell violation in terms of minimum efficiency required using post selection .
