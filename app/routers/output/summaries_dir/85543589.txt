we describe how stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) can be applied to create spectral holes in an inhomogeneously broadened system . due to the robustness of stirap , our proposal guarantees high flexibility and accuracy and , at variance with traditional spectral hole burning techniques , it may require substantially less time resources since it does not rely upon the spontaneous decay of an intermediate excited state . we investigate the effects on the scheme of dephasing and dissipation as well as of unintentional driving of undesired transitions due to a finite splitting of the initial and target state . finally , we show that the pulses can be reversed to create narrow absorption structures inside a broad spectral hole , which can be used as qubits for precise quantum operations on inhomogeneously broadened few - level systems .
