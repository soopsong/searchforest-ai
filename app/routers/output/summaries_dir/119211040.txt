we present a scheme for efficient state teleportation and entanglement swapping using a single quantum - dot spin in an optical microcavity based on giant circular birefringence . state teleportation or entanglement swapping is heralded by the sequential detection of two photons , and is finished after the spin measurement . the spin - cavity unit works as a complete bell - state analyzer with a built - in spin memory allowing loss - resistant repeater operation . this device can work in both the weak coupling and the strong coupling regime , but high efficiencies and high fidelities are only achievable when the side leakage and cavity loss is low . we assess the feasibility of this device , and show it can be implemented with current technology . we also propose a spin manipulation method using single photons , which could be used to preserve the spin coherence via spin echo techniques .
