we study electron - spin - photon coupling in a single - spin double quantum dot embedded in a superconducting stripline cavity . with an external magnetic field , we show that either a spin - orbit interaction ( for inas ) or an inhomogeneous magnetic field ( for si and gaas ) could produce a strong spin - photon coupling , with a coupling strength of the order of 1 mhz . with an isotopically purified si double dot , which has a very long spin coherence time for the electron , it is possible to reach the strong - coupling limit between the spin and the cavity photon , as in cavity quantum electrodynamics . the coupling strength and relaxation rates are calculated based on parameters of existing devices , making this proposal experimentally feasible .
