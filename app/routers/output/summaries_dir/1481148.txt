a relation between the eigenvalues of an effective hamilton operator and the poles of the $ s$ matrix is derived which holds for isolated as well as for overlapping resonance states . the system may be a many - particle quantum system with two - body forces between the constituents or it may be a quantum billiard without any two - body forces . avoided crossings of discrete states as well as of resonance states are traced back to the existence of branch points in the complex plane . under certain conditions , these branch points appear as double poles of the $ s$ matrix . they influence the dynamics of open as well as of closed quantum systems . the dynamics of the two - level system is studied in detail analytically as well as numerically .
