dynamical decoupling is a coherent control technique where the intrinsic and extrinsic couplings of a quantum system are effectively averaged out by application of specially designed driving fields ( refocusing pulse sequences ) . this entails pumping energy into the system , which can be especially dangerous when it has sharp spectral features like a cavity mode close to resonance . in this work we show that such an effect can be avoided with properly constructed refocusing sequences . to this end we construct the average hamiltonian expansion for the system evolution operator associated with a single ` ` soft ' ' pi - pulse . to second order in the pulse duration , we characterize a symmetric pulse shape by three parameters , two of which can be turned to zero by shaping . we express the effective hamiltonians for several pulse sequences in terms of these parameters , and use the results to analyze the structure of error operators for controlled jaynes - cummings hamiltonian . when errors are cancelled to second order , numerical simulations show excellent qubit fidelity with strongly - suppressed oscillator heating .
