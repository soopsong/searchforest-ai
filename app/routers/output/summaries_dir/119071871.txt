we study optomechanically - induced transparency ( omit ) in a compound system consisting of an optical cavity and an acoustic molecule , which features not only double omit peaks but also light advance . we find that by selectively driving one of the acoustic modes , omit peaks can be amplified either symmetrically or asymmetrically , accompanied by either significantly enhanced advance or a transition from advance to delay of the signal light . the sensitive impacts of the mechanical driving fields on the optical properties , including the signal transition and its high - order sidebands , are also revealed . our results confirm that selective acoustic control of omit devices provides a versatile route to achieve multi - band optical modulations , weak - signal sensing , and coherent communications of light .
