the degree of non - markovianity allows to characterizing quantum evolutions that depart from a markovian regime in a similar way as schmidt number measures the degree of entanglement of pure states . maximally non - markovian dynamics are the analogous of maximally entangled states [ d. chru\'sci\'nski and s. maniscalco , phys . rev . lett . 112 , 120404 ( 2014 ) ] . here , we demonstrate that there exists a class of maximally non - markovian quantum evolutions where the associated environment ( degrees of freedom not belonging to the system ) obeys a markovian ( memoryless ) dynamics , which in turn is unperturbed by the system state or dynamics . these properties imply the absence of any"physical environment - to - system backflow of information . "non - markovian features ( as usual in quantum systems coupled to dissipative classical degrees of freedom ) arise from a unidirectional dependence of the system dynamics on the reservoir states .
