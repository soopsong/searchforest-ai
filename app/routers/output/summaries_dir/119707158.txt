the classical schrodinger bridge seeks the most likely probability law for a diffusion process , in path space , that matches marginals at two end points in time ; the likelihood is quantified by the relative entropy between the sought law and a prior , and the law dictates a controlled path that abides by the specified marginals . schrodinger proved that the optimal steering of the density between the two end points is effected by a multiplicative functional transformation of the prior ; this transformation represents an automorphism on the space of probability measures and has since been studied by fortet , beurling and others . a similar question can be raised for processes evolving in a discrete time and space as well as for processes defined over non - commutative probability spaces . the present paper builds on earlier work by pavon and ticozzi and begins with the problem of steering a markov chain between given marginals . our approach is based on the hilbert metric and leads to an alternative proof which , however , is constructive . more specifically , we show that the solution to the schrodinger bridge is provided by the fixed point of a contractive map . we approach in a similar manner the steering of a quantum system across a quantum channel . we are able to establish existence of quantum transitions that are multiplicative functional transformations of a given kraus map , but only for the case of uniform marginals . as in the markov chain case , and for uniform density matrices , the solution of the quantum bridge can be constructed from the fixed point of a certain contractive map . for arbitrary marginal densities , extensive numerical simulations indicate that iteration of a similar map leads to fixed points from which we can construct a quantum bridge . for this general case , however , a proof of convergence remains elusive .
