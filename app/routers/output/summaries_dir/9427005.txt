we derive several bounds on fidelity between quantum states . in particular we show that fidelity is bounded from above by a simple to compute quantity we call super -- fidelity . it is analogous to another quantity called sub -- fidelity . for any two states of a two -- dimensional quantum system ( n=2 ) all three quantities coincide . we demonstrate that sub-- and super -- fidelity are concave functions . we also show that super -- fidelity is super -- multiplicative while sub -- fidelity is sub -- multiplicative and design feasible schemes to measure these quantities in an experiment . super -- fidelity can be used to define a distance between quantum states . with respect to this metric the set of quantum states forms a part of a $ n^2 - 1 $ dimensional hypersphere .
