laser trapping and interfacing of laser - cooled atoms in an optical fiber network is an important capability for quantum information science . following the pioneering work of balykin et al . and vetsch et al . , we propose a robust method of trapping single cesium atoms with a two - color state - insensitive evanescent wave around a dielectric nanofiber . specifically , we show that vector light shifts ( i.e. , effective inhomogeneous zeeman broadening of the ground states ) induced by the inherent ellipticity of the forward - propagating evanescent wave can be effectively canceled by a backward - propagating evanescent wave . furthermore , by operating the trapping lasers at the magic wavelengths , we remove the differential scalar light shift between ground and excited states , thereby allowing for resonant driving of the optical d2 transition . this scheme provides a promising approach to trap and probe neutral atoms with long trap and coherence lifetimes with realistic experimental parameters .
