we develop the generalized rotating - wave approximation ( grwa ) approach ( phys . rev . lett . 99 , 173601 ( 2007 ) ) to study the single - photon scattering on a two - level system ( tls ) with arbitrarily strong coupling to a local mode in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) coupled resonator array . we calculate the scattering amplitudes analytically , and the independent numerical results show that our approach works well in a broad parameter region . especially , when the resonator mode is faroff resonance with the tls , we obtain more reasonable results than the ones from the standard adiabatic approximation . our approach is further extended to the cases with a 1d resonator array strongly coupled to more than one tlss .
