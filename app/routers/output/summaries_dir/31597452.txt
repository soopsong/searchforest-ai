the study of how to generate high - dimensional quantum states ( qudits ) is justified by the advantages that they can bring for the field of quantum information . however , to have some real practical potential for quantum communication , these states must be also of simple manipulation . spatial qudits states , which are generated by engineering the transverse momentum of the parametric down - converted photons , have been until now considered of hard manipulation . nevertheless , we show in this work a simple technique for modifying these states . this technique is based on the use of programmable diffractive optical devices , that can act as spatial light modulators , to define the hilbert space of these photons instead of pre - fabricated multi - slits .
