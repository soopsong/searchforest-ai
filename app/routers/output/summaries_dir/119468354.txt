this paper investigates waveform estimation ( tracking ) of the time - varying force in a two - level optomechanical system with backaction noise by kalman filtering . it is assumed that the backaction and measurement noises are gaussian and white . by discretizing the continuous - time optomechanical system , the state of the resulting system can be estimated by the unbiased minimum variance kalman filtering . then an estimator of the time - varying force is obtained , provided that the external force is also in discrete time . furthermore , the accuracy of the force estimation , described by the mean squared error , is derived theoretically . finally , the feasibility of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by comparing the theoretical accuracy with the numerical accuracy in a numerical example .
