this paper is concerned with application of the classical youla - ku\v{c}era parameterization to finding a set of linear coherent quantum controllers that stabilize a linear quantum plant . the plant and controller are assumed to represent open quantum harmonic oscillators modelled by linear quantum stochastic differential equations . the interconnections between the plant and the controller are assumed to be established through quantum bosonic fields . in this framework , conditions for the stabilization of a given linear quantum plant via linear coherent quantum feedback are addressed using a stable factorization approach . the class of stabilizing quantum controllers is parameterized in the frequency domain . also , this approach is used in order to formulate coherent quantum weighted $ h_2 $ and $ h_\infty$ control problems for linear quantum systems in the frequency domain . finally , a projected gradient descent scheme is proposed to solve the coherent quantum weighted $ h_2 $ control problem .
