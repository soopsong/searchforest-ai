we investigate a network of coupled superconducting transmission line resonators , each of them made nonlinear with a capacitively shunted josephson junction coupling to the odd flux modes of the resonator . the resulting eigenmode spectrum shows anticrossings between the plasma mode of the shunted junction and the odd resonator modes . notably , we find that the combined device can inherit the complete nonlinearity of the junction , allowing for a description as a harmonic oscillator with a kerr nonlinearity . using a dc squid instead of a single junction , the nonlinearity can be tuned between 10 khz and 4 mhz while maintaining resonance frequencies of a few gigahertz for realistic device parameters . an array of such nonlinear resonators can be considered a scalable superconducting quantum simulator for a bose - hubbard hamiltonian . the device would be capable of accessing the strongly correlated regime and be particularly well suited for investigating quantum many - body dynamics of interacting particles under the influence of drive and dissipation .
