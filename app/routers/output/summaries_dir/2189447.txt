we investigate a modification in the action of inflaton due to noncommutativity leads to a nonstandard initial vacuum and oscillatory corrections in the initial power spectrum . we show that the presence of these oscillations causes a drop in the wmap $ \chi^{2}$ about $ \delta\chi^{2}\sim 8.5$. as a bonus , from the parameter estimation done in this work , we show that the noncommutative parameters can be precisely bound to $ 10^{16}$ gev or $ 10^{4}$ gev depending on the inflation scale .
