the tunneling decay event of a metastable state in a fully connected quantum spin model can be simulated efficiently by path integral quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) [ isakov $ et ~ al.$ , phys . rev . lett . $ { \bf 117}$ , 180402 ( 2016 ) . ] . this is because the exponential scaling with the number of spins of the thermally - assisted quantum tunneling rate and the kramers escape rate of qmc are identical [ jiang $ et ~ al.$ , phys . rev . a $ { \bf 95}$ , 012322 ( 2017 ) . ] , a result of a dominant instantonic tunneling path . in ref . [ 1 ] , it was also conjectured that the escape rate in open - boundary qmc is quadratically larger than that of conventional periodic - boundary qmc , therefore , open - boundary qmc might be used as a powerful tool to solve combinatorial optimization problems . the intuition behind this conjecture is that the action of the instanton in open - boundary qmc is a half of that in periodic - boundary qmc . here , we show that this simple intuition --- although very useful in interpreting some numerical results --- deviates from the actual situation in several ways . using a fully connected quantum spin model , we derive a set of conditions on the positions and momenta of the endpoints of the instanton , which remove the extra degrees of freedom due to open boundaries . in comparison , the half - instanton conjecture incorrectly sets the momenta at the endpoints to zero . we also found that the instantons in open - boundary qmc correspond to quantum tunneling events in the symmetric subspace ( maximum total angular momentum ) at all temperatures , whereas the instantons in periodic - boundary qmc typically lie in subspaces with lower total angular momenta at finite temperatures . this leads to a lesser than quadratic speedup at finite temperatures . we also outline the generalization of the instantonic tunneling method to many - qubit systems without permutation symmetry using spin - coherent - state path integrals .
