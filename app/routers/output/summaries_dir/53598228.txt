the concept of a ` ` system ' ' is foundational to physics , but the question of how observers identify systems is seldom addressed . classical thermodynamics restricts observers to finite , finite - resolution observations with which to identify the systems on which ` ` pointer state ' ' measurements are to be made . it is shown that system identification is at best approximate , even in a finite world , and that violations of the leggett -- garg and bell / chsh ( clauser - horne - shimony - holt ) inequalities emerge naturally as requirements for successful system identification .
