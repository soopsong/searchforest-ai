the development of mode - division multiplexing techniques is an important step to increase the information processing capacity . in this context , we design an efficient and robust mode - division ( de)multiplexing integrated device based on the combination of spatial adiabatic passage and supersymmetric techniques . it consists of two identical step - index external waveguides coupled to a supersymmetric central one with a specific modal content that prevents the transfer of the fundamental transverse electric spatial mode . the separation between waveguides is engineered along the propagation direction to optimize spatial adiabatic passage for the first excited transverse electric spatial mode of the step - index waveguides . thus , by injecting a superposition of the two lowest spatial modes into the step - index left waveguide , the fundamental mode remains in the left waveguide while the first excited mode is fully transmitted to the right waveguide . output fidelities $ \mathcal{f}>0.90 $ are obtained for a broad range of geometrical parameter values and light 's wavelengths , reaching $ \mathcal{f}=0.99 $ for optimized values .
