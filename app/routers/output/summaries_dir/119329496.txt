we study"the wojcik model"which is a discrete - time quantum walk ( qw ) with one defect in one dimension , introduced by wojcik et al .. for the wojcik model , we give the weak convergence theorem describing the ballistic behavior of the walker in the probability distribution in a rescaled position - space . in our previous studies , we obtained the time - averaged limit and stationary measures concerning localization for the wojcik model . as a result , we get the mathematical expression of the whole picture of the behavior of the walker for the wojcik model . here the coexistence of localization and the ballistic spreading is one of the peculiar properties of one - dimensional qws with one defect . due to the coexistence , it has been strongly expected to utilize qws to quantum search algorithms . in order to derive the weak convergence theorem , we take advantage of the generating function method . we emphasize that the time - averaged limit measure is symmetric for the origin , however , the weight function in the weak limit measure is asymmetric in general , which implies that the weak convergence theorem represents the asymmetry of the probability distribution . furthermore , the weak limit measure heavily depends on the phase of the defect and initial state of the walker . comparing with our previous studies , we also show some numerical results of the probability distribution to confirm that our result is relevant mathematically , and consider the effect of changing the phase and initial coin state on the probability distribution , or the ballistic spreading , which is one of the motivations of our study .
