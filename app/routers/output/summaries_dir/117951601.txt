we study the dynamics of isolated interacting spin chains that are periodically driven by sudden quenches . using full exact diagonalization of finite chains , we show that these systems exhibit three distinct regimes . for short driving periods , the floquet hamiltonian is well approximated by the time - averaged hamiltonian , while for long periods the evolution operator exhibits properties of random matrices of a circular ensemble ( ce ) . in - between , there is a crossover regime . based on a finite - size scaling analysis and analytic arguments we argue that , for thermodynamically large systems and non - vanishing driving periods , the evolution operator always exhibits properties of ce random matrices . consequently , the floquet hamiltonian is nonlocal and has multi - body interactions ; and the driving leads to the equivalent of an infinite temperature state at long times . these results are connected to the breakdown of the magnus expansion and are expected to hold beyond the specific lattice model considered .
