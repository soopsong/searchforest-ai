the transmission of photons through open - air or an optical fiber is an important primitive in quantum information processing . theoretical description of such a transmission process often considers only a single photon as the information carrier and thus fails to accurately describe experimental optical implementations where any number of photons may enter a detector . it is important to bridge this big gap between experimental implementations and the theoretical description . one powerful method that emerges from recent efforts to achieve this goal is to consider a squash model that conceptually converts multi - photon states to single - photon states , thereby justifying the equivalence between theory and experiments . however , up to now , only a limited number of protocols admit a squash model ; furthermore , a no - go theorem has been proven which appears to rule out the existence of a universal squash model . here , we observe that an apparently necessary condition demanded by all existing squash models to preserve measurement statistics is too stringent a requirement for many protocols . by chopping this requirement , we show that rather surprisingly , a universal squash model actually exists for a wide range of protocols including quantum key distribution protocols , quantum state tomography , the testing of bell 's inequalities , and entanglement verification , despite the standard no - go theorem .
