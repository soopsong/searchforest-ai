we model the electron clouds of nucleic acids in dna as a chain of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators with dipole - dipole interaction between nearest neighbours resulting in a van der waals type bonding . crucial parameters in our model are the distances between the acids and the coupling between them , which we estimate from numerical simulations [ 1 ] . we show that for realistic parameters nearest neighbour entanglement is present even at room temperature . we quantify the amount of entanglement in terms of negativity and single base von neumann entropy . we find that the strength of the single base von neumann entropy depends on the neighbouring sites , thus questioning the notion of treating single bases as logically independent units . we derive an analytical expression for the binding energy of the coupled chain in terms of entanglement and show the connection between entanglement and correlation energy , a quantity commonly used in quantum chemistry .
