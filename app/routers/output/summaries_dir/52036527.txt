we experimentally investigate the effectiveness of the four - wave mixing suppression in a double - lambda interaction scheme by introducing an additional ladder - type two - photon raman absorption resonance for one of the optical fields . we propose several possible interaction configurations involving either one or two isotopes of rb , and experimentally demonstrate the possibility of efficient four - wave mixing suppression in both eit and far - detuned raman cases .
