over the last decade , memristive devices have been widely adopted in computing for various conventional and unconventional applications . while the integration density , memory property , and nonlinear characteristics have many benefits , reducing the energy consumption is limited by the resistive nature of the devices . memcapacitors would address that limitation while still having all the benefits of memristors . recent work has shown that with adjusted parameters during the fabrication process , a metal - oxide device can indeed exhibit a memcapacitive behavior . we introduce novel memcapacitive logic gates and memcapacitive crossbar classifiers as a proof of concept that such applications can outperform memristor - based architectures . the results illustrate that , compared to memristive logic gates , our memcapacitive gates consume about 7x less power . the memcapacitive crossbar classifier achieves similar classification performance but reduces the power consumption by a factor of about 1,500x for the mnist dataset and a factor of about 1,000x for the cifar-10 dataset compared to a memristive crossbar . our simulation results demonstrate that memcapacitive devices have great potential for both boolean logic and analog low - power applications .
