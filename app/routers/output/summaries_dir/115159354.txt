the theory of schroedinger bridges for diffusion processes is extended to classical and quantum discrete - time markovian evolutions . the solution of the path space maximum entropy problems is obtained from the a priori model in both cases via a suitable multiplicative functional transformation . in the quantum case , nonequilibrium time reversal of quantum channels is discussed and space - time harmonic processes are introduced .
