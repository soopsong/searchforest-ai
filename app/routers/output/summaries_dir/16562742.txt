in this work we analyze a measurement - device - independent ( mdi ) protocol to establish continuous - variable ( cv ) quantum key distribution ( qkd ) between two ground stations . we assume communication occurs between the ground stations via satellite over two independent atmospheric - fading channels dominated by turbulence - induced beam wander . in this mdi protocol the measurement device is the satellite itself , and the security of the protocol is analyzed through an equivalent entanglement - based swapping scheme . we quantify the positive impact the fading channels can have on the final quantum key rates , demonstrating how the protocol is able to generate a positive key rate even over high - loss atmospheric channels . this is somewhat counter - intuitive given that the same outcome is only possible in the low - loss regime for a measurement device centrally positioned in a fiber - optic channel . our results show that useful space - based quantum key generation rates between two ground stations are possible even when the relay satellite is held by an adversary . the cost in key rate incurred by altering the status of the satellite from trustworthy to untrustworthy is presented .
