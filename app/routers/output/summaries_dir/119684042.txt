the decoherence matrix studied by gudder and sorkin ( 2011 ) can be considered as a map from the set of all the pairs of $ n$-length paths to complex numbers , which is induced by the discrete - time quantum walk . the decoherence matrix is one of the decoherence functionals which present their historical quantum measure theory . in this paper , we compute the von neumann entropy of the decoherence matrix . to do so , we use the result that the eigensystem of the decoherence matrix can be expressed by a corresponding correlated random walk .
