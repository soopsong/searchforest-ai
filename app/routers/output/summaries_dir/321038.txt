for many quantum information implementations with trapped ions , effective shuttling operations are important . here we discuss the efficient separation and recombination of ions in surface ion trap geometries . the maximum speed of separation and recombination of trapped ions for adiabatic shuttling operations depends on the secular frequencies the trapped ion experiences in the process . higher secular frequencies during the transportation processes can be achieved by optimising trap geometries . we show how two different arrangements of segmented static potential electrodes in surface ion traps can be optimised for fast ion separation or recombination processes . we also solve the equations of motion for the ion dynamics during the separation process and illustrate important considerations that need to be taken into account to make the process adiabatic .
