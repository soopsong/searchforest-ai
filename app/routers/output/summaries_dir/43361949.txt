we first show how to construct an o(n)-depth o(n)-size quantum circuit for addition of two n - bit binary numbers with no ancillary qubits . the exact size is 7n-6 , which is smaller than that of any other quantum circuit ever constructed for addition with no ancillary qubits . using the circuit , we then propose a method for constructing an o(d(n))-depth o(n)-size quantum circuit for addition with o(n / d(n ) ) ancillary qubits for any d(n)=\omega(log n ) . if we are allowed to use unbounded fan - out gates with length o(n^c ) for an arbitrary small positive constant c , we can modify the method and construct an o(e(n))-depth o(n)-size circuit with o(n ) ancillary qubits for any e(n)=\omega(log * n ) . in particular , these methods yield efficient circuits with depth o(log n ) and with depth o(log * n ) , respectively . we apply our circuits to constructing efficient quantum circuits for shor 's discrete logarithm algorithm .
