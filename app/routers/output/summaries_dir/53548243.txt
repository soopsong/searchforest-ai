a qubit can relax by fluorescence , which prompts the release of a photon into its electromagnetic environment . by counting the emitted photons , discrete quantum jumps of the qubit state can be observed . the succession of states occupied by the qubit in a single experiment , its quantum trajectory , depends in fact on the kind of detector . how are the quantum trajectories modified if one measures continuously the amplitude of the fluorescence field instead ? using a superconducting parametric amplifier , we have performed heterodyne detection of the fluorescence of a superconducting qubit . for each realization of the measurement record , we can reconstruct a different quantum trajectory for the qubit . the observed evolution obeys quantum state diffusion , which is characteristic of quantum measurements subject to zero point fluctuations . independent projective measurements of the qubit at various times provide a quantitative validation of the reconstructed trajectories . by exploring the statistics of quantum trajectories , we demonstrate that the qubit states span a deterministic surface in the bloch sphere at each time in the evolution . additionally , we show that when monitoring fluorescence , coherent superpositions are generated during the decay from excited to ground state . counterintuitively , measuring light emitted during relaxation can give rise to trajectories with increased excitation probability .
