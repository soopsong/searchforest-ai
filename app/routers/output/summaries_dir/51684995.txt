this paper addresses the problem of finding the depth overhead that will be incurred when running quantum algorithms on near - term quantum computers . specifically , it is envisaged that near - term quantum computers will have low qubit connectivity : each qubit will only be able to interact with a subset of the other qubits , a reality typically represented by a qubit interaction graph in which a vertex represents a qubit and an edge represents a possible direct 2-qubit interaction ( gate ) . thus the depth overhead is unavoidably incurred by introducing swap gates into the quantum circuit to enable general qubit interactions . this paper proves that there exist quantum circuits where a depth overhead in $ \omega(\log n)$ must necessarily be incurred when running quantum algorithms with $ n$ qubits on quantum computers whose qubit interaction graph has finite degree , but that such a depth overhead is achievable .
