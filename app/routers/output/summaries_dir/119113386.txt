we propose and investigate an optical scheme for probabilistic implementation of an arbitrary single - mode quantum operation that can be expressed as a function of photon number operator . the scheme coherently combines multiple photon addition and subtraction and is feasible with current technology . as concrete examples , we demonstrate that the device can perform approximate noiseless linear amplification of light and can emulate kerr nonlinearity .
