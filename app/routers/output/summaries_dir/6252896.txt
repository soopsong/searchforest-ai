we demonstrate non - degenerate down - conversion at 810 and 1550 nm for long - distance fiber based quantum communication using polarization entangled photon pairs . measurements of the two - photon visibility , without dark count subtraction , have shown that the quantum correlations ( raw visibility 89 % ) allow secure quantum cryptography after 100 km of non - zero dispersion shifted fiber using commercially available single photon detectors . in addition , quantum state tomography has revealed little degradation of state negativity , decreasing from 0.99 at the source to 0.93 after 100 km , indicating minimal loss in fidelity during the transmission .
