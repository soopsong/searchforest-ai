any experiment attempting to verify the presence of entanglement in a physical system can only generate a finite amount of data . the statement that entanglement was present in the system can thus never be issued with certainty , requiring instead a statistical analysis of the data . because entanglement plays a central role in the performance of quantum devices , it is crucial to make statistical claims in entanglement verification experiments that are reliable and have a clear interpretation . in this work , we apply recent results by m. christandl and r. renner to construct a reliable entanglement verification procedure based on the concept of confidence regions . the statements made do not require the specification of a prior distribution , the assumption of independent measurements nor the assumption of an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) source of states . moreover , we develop numerical tools that are necessary to employ this approach in practice , rendering the procedure ready to be applied to current experiments . we demonstrate this technique by analyzing the data of a photonic experiment generating two - photon states whose entanglement is verified with the use of an accessible nonlinear witness .
