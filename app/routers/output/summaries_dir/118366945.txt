we analyze the performance of a quantum repeater protocol based on single trapped ions . at each node , single trapped ions embedded into high finesse cavities emit single photons whose polarization is entangled with the ion state . a specific detection of two photons at a central station located half - way between two nodes heralds the entanglement of two remote ions . entanglement can be extended to long distances by applying successive entanglement swapping operations based on two - ion gate operations that have already been demonstrated experimentally with high precision . our calculation shows that the distribution rate of entanglement achievable with such an ion - based quantum repeater protocol is higher by orders of magnitude than the rates that are achievable with the best known schemes based on atomic ensemble memories and linear optics . the main reason is that for trapped ions the entanglement swapping operations are performed deterministically , in contrast to success probabilities below 50 percent per swapping with linear optics . the scheme requires efficient collection of the emitted photons , which can be achieved with cavities , and efficient conversion of their wavelength , which can be done via stimulated parametric down - conversion . we also suggest how to realize temporal multiplexing , which offers additional significant speed - ups in entanglement distribution , with trapped ions .
