we propose an on - chip source of entangled photon pairs that uses an arrayed - waveguide grating ( awg ) with multiple nonlinear input waveguides as correlated photon pair sources . the awg wavelength - demultiplexes photon pairs created in input waveguides and simultaneously produces a high - dimensional entangled state encoded in the optical path . we implemented the device with a monolithic silicon - silica waveguide integration platform and demonstrated the entanglement of two dimensions in a proof - of - principle experiment .
