we engineer mechanical gain ( loss ) in system formed by two optomechanical cavities ( omcs ) , that are mechanically coupled . the gain ( loss ) is controlled by driving the resonator with laser that is blue ( red ) detuned . we predict analytically the existence of multiple exceptional points ( eps ) , a form of degeneracy where the eigenvalues of the system coalesce . at each ep , phase transition occurs , and the system switches from weak to strong coupling regimes and vice versa . in the weak coupling regime , the system locks on an intermediate frequency , resulting from coalescence at the ep . in strong coupling regime , however , two or several mechanical modes are excited depending on system parameters . the mechanical resonators exhibit rabi - oscillations when two mechanical modes are involved , otherwise the interaction triggers chaos in strong coupling regime . this chaos is bounded by eps , making it easily controllable by tuning these degeneracies . moreover , this chaotic attractor shows up for low driving power , compared to what happens when the coupled omcs are both drived in blue sidebands . this works opens up promising avenues to use eps as a new tool to study collective phenomena ( synchronization , locking effects ) in nonlinear systems , and to control chaos .
