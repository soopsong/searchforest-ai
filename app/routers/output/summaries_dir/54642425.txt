we study a bose - hubbard hamiltonian of ultracold two component gas of spinor chromium atoms . dipolar interactions of magnetic moments while tuned resonantly by ultralow magnetic field can lead to spin flipping . due to approximate axial symmetry of individual lattice site , total angular momentum is conserved . therefore , all changes of the spin are accompanied by the appearance of the angular orbital momentum . this way excited wannier states with non vanishing angular orbital momentum can be created . resonant dipolar coupling of the two component bose gas introduces additional degree of control of the system , and leads to a variety of different stable phases . the phase diagram for small number of particles is discussed .
