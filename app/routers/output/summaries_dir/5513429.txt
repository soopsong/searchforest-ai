the dicke model consisting of an ensemble of two - state atoms interacting with a single quantized mode of the electromagnetic field exhibits a zero - temperature phase transition at a critical value of the dipole coupling strength . we propose a scheme based on multilevel atoms and cavity - mediated raman transitions to realise an effective dicke system operating in the phase transition regime . output light from the cavity carries signatures of the critical behavior which is analyzed for the thermodynamic limit where the number of atoms is very large .
