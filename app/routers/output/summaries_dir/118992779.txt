classically , no transfer occurs between two equally filled reservoirs no matter how one looks at them , but the situation can be different quantum mechanically . this paradoxically surprising phenomenon rests on the distinctive property of the quantum world that one can not stare at a system without disturbing it . it was recently discovered that this seemingly annoying feature could be harnessed to control small quantum systems using weak measurements . here we present one of the simplest models -- an idealised double quantum dot -- where by toying with the dot measurement strength , i.e. the intensity of the look , it is possible to create a particle flux in an otherwise completely symmetric system . the basic property underlying this phenomena is that measurement disturbances are very different on a system evolving unitarily and a system evolving dissipatively . this effect shows that adaptive measurements can have dramatic effects enabling transport control but possibly inducing biases in the measurement of macroscopic quantities if not handled with care .
