in this paper we consider the conditions under which a given ensemble of two - qubit states can be optimally distinguished by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) . we begin by completing the \emph{perfect } distinguishability problem of two - qubit ensembles - both for separable operations and locc - by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the perfect discrimination of one pure and one mixed state . then for the well - known task of minimum error discrimination , it is shown that \textit{almost all } two - qubit ensembles consisting of three pure states can not be optimally discriminated using locc . this is surprising considering that \textit{any } two pure states can be distinguished optimally by locc . special attention is given to ensembles that lack entanglement , and we prove an easy sufficient condition for when a set of three product states can not be optimally distinguished by locc , thus providing new examples of the phenomenon known as"non - locality without entanglement " . we next consider an example of $ n$ parties who each share the same state but who are ignorant of its identity . the state is drawn from the rotationally invariant"trine ensemble " , and we establish a tight connection between the $ n$-copy ensemble and shor's"lifted"single - copy ensemble . for any finite $ n$ , we prove that optimal identification of the states can not be achieved by locc ; however as $ n\to\infty$ , locc can indeed discriminate the states optimally . this is the first result of its kind . finally , we turn to the task of unambiguous discrimination and derive new lower bounds on the locc inconclusive probability for symmetric states . when applied to the double trine ensemble , this leads to a rather different distinguishability character than when the minimum - error probability is considered .
