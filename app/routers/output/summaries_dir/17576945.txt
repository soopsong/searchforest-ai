we derive a computable analytical formula for the quantum fidelity between two arbitrary multimode gaussian states which is simply expressed in terms of their first- and second - order statistical moments . we also show how such a formula can be written in terms of symplectic invariants and used to derive closed forms for a variety of basic quantities and tools , such as the bures metric , the quantum fisher information and various fidelity - based bounds . our result can be used to extend the study of continuous - variable protocols , such as quantum teleportation and cloning , beyond the current one - mode or two - mode analyses , and paves the way to solve general problems in quantum metrology and quantum hypothesis testing with arbitrary multimode gaussian resources .
