by using the memristor 's memory to both store a bit and perform an operation with a second input bit , simple boolean logic gates have been built with a single memristor . the operation makes use of the interaction of current spikes ( occasionally called current transients ) found in both memristors and other devices . the sequential time - based logic methodology allows two logical input bits to be used on a one - port by sending the bits separated in time . the resulting logic gate is faster than one relying on memristor 's state switching , low power and requires only one memristor . we experimentally demonstrate working or and xor gates made with a single flexible titanium dioxide sol - gel memristor .
