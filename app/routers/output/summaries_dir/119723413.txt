we show that the entanglement witnesses based on local orthogonal observables which are introduced in [ s. yu and n.-l . liu , phys . rev . lett . 95 , 150504 ( 2005 ) ] and [ o. g\"uhne , m. mechler , g. t\'oth and p. adam , phys . rev . a 74 , 010301 ( 2006 ) ] in linear and nonlinear forms can be optimized , respectively . as applications , we calculate the optimal nonlinear witnesses of pure bipartite states and show a lower bound on the i - concurrence of bipartite higher dimensional systems with our method .
