quantum discord q is a function of density matrix elements . the domain of such a function in the case of two - qubit system with x density matrix may consist of three subdomains at most : two ones where the quantum discord is expressed in closed analytical forms ( q_{\pi/2 } and q_0 ) and an intermediate subdomain for which , to extract the quantum discord q_\theta , it is required to solve in general numerically a one - dimensional minimization problem to find the optimal measurement angle \theta\in(0,\pi/2 ) . hence the quantum discord is given by a piecewise - analytic - numerical formula q=\min{q_{\pi/2 } , q_\theta , q_0 } . equations for determining the boundaries between these subdomains are obtained . the boundaries consist of bifurcation points . the q_{\theta } subdomains are discovered in the generalized horodecki states , in the dynamical phase flip channel model , in the anisotropic spin systems at thermal equilibrium , in the heteronuclear dimers in an external magnetic field . we found that transitions between q_{\theta } subdomain and q_{\pi/2 } and q_0 ones occur suddenly but continuously and smoothly , i.e. , nonanalyticity is hidden and can be observed in higher derivatives of discord function .
