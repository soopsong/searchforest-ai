we propose a scheme via three - level cascade atoms to entangle two optomechanical oscillators as well as two - mode fields . we show that two movable mirrors and two - mode fields can be entangled even for bad cavity limit . we also study entanglement of the output two - mode fields in frequency domain . the results show that the frequency of the mirror oscillation and the injected atomic coherence affect the output entanglement of the two - mode fields .
