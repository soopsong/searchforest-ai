channel polarization is a phenomenon in which a particular recursive encoding induces a set of synthesized channels from many instances of a memoryless channel , such that a fraction of the synthesized channels becomes near perfect for data transmission and the other fraction becomes near useless for this task . mahdavifar and vardy have recently exploited this phenomenon to construct codes that achieve the symmetric private capacity for private data transmission over a degraded wiretap channel . in the current paper , we build on their work and demonstrate how to construct quantum wiretap polar codes that achieve the symmetric private capacity of a degraded quantum wiretap channel with a classical eavesdropper . due to the schumacher - westmoreland correspondence between quantum privacy and quantum coherence , we can construct quantum polar codes by operating these quantum wiretap polar codes in superposition , much like devetak 's technique for demonstrating the achievability of the coherent information rate for quantum data transmission . our scheme achieves the symmetric coherent information rate for quantum channels that are degradable with a classical environment . this condition on the environment may seem restrictive , but we show that many quantum channels satisfy this criterion , including amplitude damping channels , photon - detected jump channels , dephasing channels , erasure channels , and cloning channels . our quantum polar coding scheme has the desirable properties of being channel - adapted and symmetric capacity - achieving along with having an efficient encoder , but we have not demonstrated that the decoding is efficient . also , the scheme may require entanglement assistance , but we show that the rate of entanglement consumption vanishes in the limit of large blocklength if the channel is degradable with classical environment .
