the properties of the four families of special functions of three real variables , called here c- , s- , s^s- and s^l - functions , are studied . the s^s- and s^l - functions are considered in all details required for their exploitation in fourier expansions of digital data , sampled on finite fragment of lattices of any density and of the 3d symmetry imposed by the weight lattices of b_3 and c_3 simple lie algebras / groups . the continuous interpolations , which are induced by the discrete expansions , are exemplified and compared for some model functions .
