we propose classical interferometry with low - intensity thermal radiation for the estimation of nonclassical independent gaussian processes in material samples . we generally determine the mean square error of the phase - independent parameters of an unknown gaussian process , considering a noisy source of radiation the phase of which is not locked to the pump of the process . we verify the sufficiency of passive optical elements in the interferometer , active optical elements do not improve the quality of the estimation . we also prove the robustness of the method against the noise and loss in both interferometric channels and the sample . the proposed method is suitable even for the case when a source of radiation sufficient for homodyne detection is not available .
