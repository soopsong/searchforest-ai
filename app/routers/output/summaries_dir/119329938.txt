we examine the moment - reconstruction performance of both the homodyne and heterodyne ( double - homodyne ) measurement schemes for arbitrary quantum states and introduce moment estimators that optimize the respective schemes for any given data . in the large - data limit , these estimators are as efficient as the maximum - likelihood estimators . we then illustrate the superiority of the heterodyne measurement for the reconstruction of the first and second moments by analyzing gaussian states and many other significant non - classical states .
