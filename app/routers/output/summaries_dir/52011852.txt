measurement - based quantum computation ( mqc ) is a leading paradigm for building a quantum computer . cluster states being used in this context act as one - way quantum computers . here , we consider z - states as a type of highly entangled states like cluster states , which can be used for one - way or measurement based quantum computation . we define z - state basis as a set of orthonormal states which are as equally entangled as the cluster states . we design new quantum circuits to non - destructively discriminate these highly entangled z - states . the proposed quantum circuits can be generalized for n - qubit quantum system . we confirm the preservation of z - states after the performance of the circuit by quantum state tomography process .
