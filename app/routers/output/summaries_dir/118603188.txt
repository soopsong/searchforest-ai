we present three different matrix bases that can be used to decompose density matrices of $ d$--dimensional quantum systems , so - called qudits : the \emph{generalized gell - mann matrix basis } , the \emph{polarization operator basis } , and the \emph{weyl operator basis } . such a decomposition can be identified with a vector --the bloch vector , i.e. a generalization of the well known qubit case-- and is a convenient expression for comparison with measurable quantities and for explicit calculations avoiding the handling of large matrices . we present a new method to decompose density matrices via so -- called standard matrices , consider the important case of an isotropic two -- qudit state and decompose it according to each basis . in case of qutrits we show a representation of an entanglement witness in terms of expectation values of spin 1 measurements , which is appropriate for an experimental realization .
