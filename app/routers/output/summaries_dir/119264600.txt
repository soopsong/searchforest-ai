we study the generation of entanglement induced by a single - photon gaussian wavepacket in multi - atom bi - directional waveguide qed . in particular , we investigate the effect of increasing the number of atoms on the average pairwise entanglement . we demonstrate by selecting smaller decay rates and in chiral waveguide settings , that both entanglement survival times and maximum generated entanglement can be increased by at least a factor of 3/2 , independent of the number of atoms . in addition , we analyze the influence of detuning and delays on the robustness of the generated entanglement . there are potential applications of our results in entanglement based multi - qubit quantum networks
