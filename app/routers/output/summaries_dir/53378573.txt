in a recent work by novo et al . ( sci . rep . 5 , 13304 , 2015 ) , the invariant subspace method was applied to the study of continuous - time quantum walk ( ctqw ) . the method helps to reduce a graph into a simpler version that allows more transparent analyses of the quantum walk model . in this work , we adopt the aforementioned method to investigate the optimality of a quantum walk search of a marked element on a complete multi - partite graph . we formulate the eigenbasis that would facilitate the transport between the two lowest energy eigenstates and demonstrate how to set the appropriate coupling factor to preserve the optimality .
