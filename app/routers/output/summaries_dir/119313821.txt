in this paper , we establish a connection between zonoids ( a concept from classical convex geometry ) and the distinguishability norms associated to quantum measurements , or povms ( positive operator - valued measures ) , recently introduced in quantum information theory . this correspondence allows us to state and prove the povm version of classical results from the local theory of banach spaces about the approximation of zonoids by zonotopes . we show that on $ \mathbf{c}^d$ , the uniform povm ( the most symmetric povm ) can be sparsified , i.e. approximated by a discrete povm , the latter having only $ o(d^2)$ outcomes . we also show that similar ( but weaker ) approximation results actually hold for any povm on $ \mathbf{c}^d$. by defining an appropriate notion of tensor product for zonoids , we are then able to extend our results to the multipartite setting : we show , roughly speaking , that local povms may be sparsified locally . in particular , the local uniform povm on $ \mathbf{c}^{d_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathbf{c}^{d_k}$ can be approximated by a discrete povm which is local and has $ o(d_1 ^ 2\times\cdots\times d_k^2)$ outcomes .
