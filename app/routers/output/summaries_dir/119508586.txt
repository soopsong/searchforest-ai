stationary and slow light effects are of great interest for quantum information applications . using laser - cooled rb87 atoms we have performed side imaging of our atomic ensemble under slow and stationary light conditions , which allows direct comparison with numerical models . the polaritions were generated using electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , with stationary light generated using counter - propagating control fields . by controlling the power ratio of the two control fields we show fine control of the group velocity of the stationary light . we also compare the dynamics of stationary light using monochromatic and bichromatic control fields . our results show negligible difference between the two situations , in contrast to previous work in eit based systems .
