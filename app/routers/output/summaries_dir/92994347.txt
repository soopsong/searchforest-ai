quantum superpositions of coherent states are produced both in microwave and optical domains , and are considered realizations of the famous"schr\"odinger cat"state . the recent progress shows an increase in the number of components and the number of modes involved . our work creates a theoretical framework for treatment of multicomponent two - mode schr\"odinger cat states . we consider a class of single - mode states , which are superpositions of $ n$ coherent states lying on a circle in the phase space . in this class we consider an orthonormal basis created by rotationally - invariant circular states ( rics ) . a two - mode extension of this basis is created by splitting a single - mode rics on a balanced beam - splitter . we show that these states are generalizations of bell states of two qubits to the case of $ n$-level systems encoded into superpositions of coherent states on the circle , and we propose for them the name of generalized quasi - bell states . we show that using a state of this class as a shared resource , one can teleport a superposition of coherent states on the circle ( a qudit ) . differently from some other existing protocols of quantum teleportation , the proposed protocol provides the unit fidelity for all input states of the qudit . we calculate the probability of success for this type of teleportation and show that it approaches unity for the average number of photons in one component above $ n^2$. thus , the teleportation protocol can be made unit - fidelity and deterministic at finite resources .
