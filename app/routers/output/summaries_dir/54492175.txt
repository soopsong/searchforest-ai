we prove some new properties of fidelity ( transition probability ) and concurrence , the latter defined by straightforward extension of wootters notation . choose a conjugation and consider the dependence of fidelity or of concurrence on conjugated pairs of density operators . these functions turn out to be concave or convex roofs . optimal decompositions are constructed . some applications to two- and tripartite systems illustrate the general theorem .
