we consider the feedback stabilization of rabi oscillations in a superconducting qubit which is coupled to a microwave readout cavity . the signal is readout by homodyne detection of the in - phase quadrature amplitude of the weak measurement output . by multiplying the time - delayed rabi reference , one can extract the signal , with maximum signal - to - noise ratio , from the noise . we further track and stabilize the rabi oscillations by using lyapunov feedback control to properly adjust the input rabi drives . theoretical and simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control law .
