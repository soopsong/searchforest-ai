quantum information technologies require careful control for generating and preserving a desired target quantum state . the biggest practical obstacle is , of course , decoherence . therefore , the reachability analysis , which in our scenario aims to estimate the distance between the controlled state under decoherence and the target state , is of great importance to evaluate the realistic performance of those technologies . this paper presents a lower bound of the fidelity - based distance for a general open markovian quantum system driven by the decoherence process and several types of control including feedback . the lower bound is straightforward to calculate and can be used as a guide for choosing the target state , as demonstrated in some examples . moreover , the lower bound is applied to derive a theoretical limit in some quantum metrology problems based on a large - size atomic ensemble under control and decoherence .
