identical particles exhibit correlations even in the absence of inter - particle interaction , due to the exchange ( anti)symmetry of the many - particle wavefunction . two fermions obey the pauli principle and anti - bunch , whereas two bosons favor bunched , doubly occupied states . here , we show that the collective interference of three or more particles leads to a much more diverse behavior than expected from the boson - fermion dichotomy known from quantum statistical mechanics . the emerging complexity of many - particle interference is tamed by a simple law for the strict suppression of events in the bell multiport beam splitter . the law shows that counting events are governed by widely species - independent interference , such that bosons and fermions can even exhibit identical interference signatures , while their statistical character remains subordinate . recent progress in the preparation of tailored many - particle states of bosonic and fermionic atoms promises experimental verification and applications in novel many - particle interferometers .
