we consider the renyi entropies s_n in one - dimensional massive integrable models diagonalizable by means of corner transfer matrices ( as heisenberg and ising spin chains ) . by means of explicit examples and using the relation of corner transfer matrix with the virasoro algebra , we show that close to a conformal invariant critical point , when the correlation length xi is finite but large , the corrections to the scaling are of the unusual form xi^(-x / n ) , with x the dimension of a relevant operator in the conformal theory . this is reminiscent of the results for gapless chains and should be valid for any massive one - dimensional model close to a conformal critical point .
