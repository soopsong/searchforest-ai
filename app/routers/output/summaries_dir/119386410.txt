the general theory of relativity is the currently accepted theory of gravity and as such , a large repository of test results has been carried out since its inception in 1915 . however , in this paper we will only focus on what are considered as the main tests but in non - commutative geometries . using the coordinate coherent state formalism , we consider gravitational red - shift , deflection , and time delay of light , separately , for schwarzschild and riessner - nordstrom metrics in their non - commutative form . we will schematically show that these non - commutative calculations have different behavior with respect to the predictions of general relativity . we also specify an upper bound on the non - commutative parameter by comparing the results with accuracies of gravitational measurements for typical micro black holes which can be produced in the early universe .
