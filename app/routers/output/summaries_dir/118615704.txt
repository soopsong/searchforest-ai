we solve stationarity equations of the geometric measure of entanglement for multi - qubit w - type states . in this way we compute analytically the maximal overlap of one - parameter $ n$-qubit and two - parameter four - qubit w - type states and their nearest product states . possible extensions to arbitrary w - type states and geometrical interpretations of these results are discussed in detail .
