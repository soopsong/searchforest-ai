experimental characterizations of a quantum system involve the measurement of expectation values of observables for a preparable state |psi > of the quantum system . such expectation values can be measured by repeatedly preparing |psi > and coupling the system to an apparatus . for this method , the precision of the measured value scales as 1 / sqrt(n ) for n repetitions of the experiment . for the problem of estimating the parameter phi in an evolution exp(-i phi h ) , it is possible to achieve precision 1 / n ( the quantum metrology limit ) provided that sufficient information about h and its spectrum is available . we consider the more general problem of estimating expectations of operators a with minimal prior knowledge of a. we give explicit algorithms that approach precision 1 / n given a bound on the eigenvalues of a or on their tail distribution . these algorithms are particularly useful for simulating quantum systems on quantum computers because they enable efficient measurement of observables and correlation functions . our algorithms are based on a method for efficiently measuring the complex overlap of |psi > and u|psi > , where u is an implementable unitary operator . we explicitly consider the issue of confidence levels in measuring observables and overlaps and show that , as expected , confidence levels can be improved exponentially with linear overhead . we further show that the algorithms given here can typically be parallelized with minimal increase in resource usage .
