general trojan horse attacks on quantum key distribution systems are analyzed . we illustrate the power of such attacks with today 's technology and conclude that all system must implement active counter - measures . in particular all systems must include an auxiliary detector that monitors any incoming light . we show that such counter - measures can be efficient , provided enough additional privacy amplification is applied to the data . we present a practical way to reduce the maximal information gain that an adversary can gain using trojan horse attacks . this does reduce the security analysis of the 2-way { \it plug-&-play } system to those of the standard 1-way systems .
