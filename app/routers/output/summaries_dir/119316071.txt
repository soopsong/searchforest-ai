we consider network routing under random link failures with a desired final distribution . we provide a mathematical formulation of a relaxed transport problem where the final distribution only needs to be close to the desired one . the problem is a maximum entropy problem for path distributions with an extra terminal cost . we show that the unique solution may be obtained solving a generalized schroedinger system . an iterative algorithm to compute the solution is provided . it contracts the hilbert metric with contraction ratio less than 1/2 leading to extremely fast convergence .
