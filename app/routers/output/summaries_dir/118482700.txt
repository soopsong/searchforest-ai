there are successful applications of the holographic ads / cft correspondence to high energy and condensed matter physics . we apply the holographic approach to photosynthesis that is an important example of nontrivial quantum phenomena relevant for life which is being studied in the emerging field of quantum biology . light harvesting complexes of photosynthetic organisms are many - body quantum systems , in which quantum coherence has recently been experimentally shown to survive for relatively long time scales even at the physiological temperature despite the decohering effects of their environments . we use the holographic approach to evaluate the time dependence of entanglement entropy and quantum mutual information in the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) protein - pigment complex in green sulfur bacteria during the transfer of an excitation from a chlorosome antenna to a reaction center . it is demonstrated that the time evolution of the mutual information simulating the lindblad master equation in some cases can be obtained by means of a dual gravity describing black hole formation in the ads - vaidya spacetime . the wake up and scrambling times for various partitions of the fmo complex are discussed .
