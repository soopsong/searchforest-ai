we consider the quantum simulation of relativistic quantum mechanics , as described by the dirac equation and classical potentials , in trapped - ion systems . we concentrate on three problems of growing complexity . first , we study the bidimensional relativistic scattering of single dirac particles by a linear potential . furthermore , we explore the case of a dirac particle in a magnetic field and its topological properties . finally , we analyze the problem of two dirac particles that are coupled by a controllable and confining potential . the latter interaction may be useful to study important phenomena as the confinement and asymptotic freedom of quarks .
