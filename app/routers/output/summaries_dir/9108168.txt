we have tried to interpret the physical role of the three - tangle and $ \pi$-tangle in the real physical information process . for the model calculation we adopt the three - party teleportation scheme through the various noisy channels . the three parties consist of sender , accomplice and receiver . it is shown that the $ \pi$-tangles for the x- and z - noisy channels vanish at $ \kappa t \to \infty$ limit , where $ \kappa t$ is a parameter introduced in the master equation of lindblad form . in this limit the receiver 's maximum fidelity reduces to the classical limit 2/3 . however , this nice feature is not maintained at the y- and isotropy - noise channels . for y - noise channel the $ \pi$-tangle vanishes at $ 0.61 \leq \kappa t$. at $ \kappa t = 0.61 $ the receiver 's maximum fidelity becomes 0.57 , which is much less than the classical limit . similar phenomenon occurs at the isotropic noise channel . we also computed the three - tangles analytically for the x- and z - noise channels . the remarkable fact is that the three - tangle for z - noise channel is exactly same with the corresponding $ \pi$-tangle . in the x - noise channel the three - tangle vanishes at $ 0.10 \leq \kappa t$. at $ \kappa t = 0.10 $ the receiver 's fidelity can be reduced to the classical limit provided that the accomplice performs the measurement appropriately . however , the receiver 's maximum fidelity becomes 8/9 , which is much larger than the classical limit . since the y- and isotropy - noise channels are rank-8 mixed states , their three - tangles are not computed explicitly . instead , we have derived their upper bounds with use of the analytical three - tangles for other noisy channels . our analysis strongly suggests that we need different three - party entanglement measure whose value is between three - tangle and $ \pi$-tangle .
