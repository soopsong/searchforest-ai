in recent years the interest in studying interactions of rydberg atoms or ensembles thereof with optical and microwave frequency fields has steadily increased , both in the context of basic research and for potential applications in quantum information processing . we present measurements of the dispersive interaction between an ensemble of helium atoms in the 37s rydberg state and a single resonator mode by extracting the amplitude and phase change of a weak microwave probe tone transmitted through the cavity . the results are in quantitative agreement with predictions made on the basis of the dispersive tavis - cummings hamiltonian . we study this system with the goal of realizing a hybrid between superconducting circuits and rydberg atoms . we measure maximal collective coupling strengths of 1 mhz , corresponding to 3 * 10 ^ 3 rydberg atoms coupled to the cavity . as expected , the dispersive shift is found to be inversely proportional to the atom - cavity detuning and proportional to the number of rydberg atoms . this possibility of measuring the number of rydberg atoms in a nondestructive manner is relevant for quantitatively evaluating scattering cross sections in experiments with rydberg atoms .
