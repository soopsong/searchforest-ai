the hypothesis of the self - induced collapse of the inflaton wave function was proposed as responsible for the emergence of inhomogeneity and anisotropy at all scales . this proposal was studied within an almost de sitter space - time approximation for the background , which led to a perfect scale - invariant power spectrum , and also for a quasi - de sitter background , which allows to distinguish departures from the standard approach due to the inclusion of the collapse hypothesis . in this work we perform a bayesian model comparison for two different choices of the self - induced collapse in a full quasi - de sitter expansion scenario . in particular , we analyze the possibility of detecting the imprint of these collapse schemes at low multipoles of the anisotropy temperature power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) using the most recent data provided by the planck collaboration . our results show that one of the two collapse schemes analyzed provides the same bayesian evidence of the minimal standard cosmological model $ \lambda$cdm , while the other scenario is weakly disfavoured with respect to the standard cosmology .
