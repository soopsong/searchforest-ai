we describe a scheme for quantum error correction that employs feedback and weak measurement rather than the standard tools of projective measurement and fast controlled unitary gates . the advantage of this scheme over previous protocols ( for example ahn et . al , pra , 65 , 042301 ( 2001 ) ) , is that it requires little side processing while remaining robust to measurement inefficiency , and is therefore considerably more practical . we evaluate the performance of our scheme by simulating the correction of bit - flips . we also consider implementation in a solid - state quantum computation architecture and estimate the maximal error rate which could be corrected with current technology .
