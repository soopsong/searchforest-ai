quantum walks are the quantum - mechanical analog of random walks , in which a quantum ` walker ' evolves between initial and final states by traversing the edges of a graph , either in discrete steps from node to node or via continuous evolution under the hamiltonian furnished by the adjacency matrix of the graph . we present a hybrid scheme for universal quantum computation in which a quantum walker takes discrete steps of continuous evolution . this ` discontinuous ' quantum walk employs perfect quantum state transfer between two nodes of specific subgraphs chosen to implement a universal gate set , thereby ensuring unitary evolution without requiring the introduction of an ancillary coin space . the run time is linear in the number of simulated qubits and gates . the scheme allows multiple runs of the algorithm to be executed almost simultaneously by starting walkers one timestep apart .
