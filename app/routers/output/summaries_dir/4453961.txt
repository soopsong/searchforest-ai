the concept of randomness plays an important role in many disciplines . on one hand , the question of whether random processes exist is fundamental for our understanding of nature . on the other hand , randomness is a resource for cryptography , algorithms and simulations . standard methods for generating randomness rely on assumptions on the devices that are difficult to meet in practice . however , quantum technologies allow for new methods for generating certified randomness . these methods are known as device - independent because do not rely on any modeling of the devices . here we review the efforts and challenges to design device - independent randomness generators .
