a beam splitter is a simple , readily available device which can act to entangle the output optical fields . we show that a necessary condition for the fields at the output of the beam splitter to be entangled is that the pure input states exhibit nonclassical behavior . we generalize this proof for arbitrary ( pure or impure ) gaussian input states . specifically , nonclassicality of the input gaussian fields is a necessary condition for entanglement of the field modes with the help of the beam splitter . we conjecture that this is a general property of the beam splitter : nonclassicality of the inputs is a necessary condition for entangling fields in the beam splitter .
