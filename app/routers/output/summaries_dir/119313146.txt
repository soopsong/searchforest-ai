we present a unifying approach to quantum error correcting code design that encompasses additive ( stabilizer ) codes , as well as all known examples of nonadditive codes with good parameters . we use this framework to generate new codes with superior parameters to any previously known . in particular , we find ( ( 10,18,3 ) ) and ( ( 10,20,3 ) ) codes . we also show how to construct encoding circuits for all codes within our framework .
