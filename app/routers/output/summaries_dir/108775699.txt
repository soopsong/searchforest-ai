this paper presents an extensive characterization and modeling of a commercial 28-nm fdsoi cmos process operating down to cryogenic temperatures . the important cryogenic phenomena influencing this technology are discussed . the low - temperature transfer characteristics including body - biasing are modeled over a wide temperature range ( room temperature down to 4.2\,k ) using the design - oriented simplified - ekv model . the trends of the free - carrier mobilities versus temperature in long and short - narrow devices are extracted from dc measurements down to 1.4\,k and 4.2\,k respectively , using a recently - proposed method based on the output conductance . a cryogenic - temperature - induced mobility degradation is observed on long pmos , leading to a maximum hole mobility around 77\,k . this work sets the stage for preparing industrial design kits with physics - based cryogenic compact models , a prerequisite for the successful co - integration of fdsoi cmos circuits with silicon qubits operating at deep - cryogenic temperatures .
