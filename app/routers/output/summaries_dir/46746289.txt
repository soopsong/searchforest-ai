we investigated the estimation of an unknown gaussian process ( containing displacement , squeezing and phase - shift ) applied to a matter system . the state of the matter system is not directly measured ; instead , we measure an optical mode which interacts with the system . we propose an interferometric setup exploiting a beam - splitter - type of light - matter interaction with homodyne detectors and two methods of estimation . we demonstrate the superiority of the interferometric setup over alternative non - interferometric schemes . importantly , we show that even limited coupling strength and a noisy matter system are sufficient for very good estimation . our work opens the way to many future investigations of light - matter interferometry for experimental platforms in quantum metrology of matter systems .
