we provide the quantum mechanical description of the excitation of long - range surface plasmon polaritons ( lrspps ) on thin metallic strips . the excitation process consists of an attenuated - reflection setup , where efficient photon - to - lrspp wavepacket - transfer is shown to be achievable . for calculating the coupling , we derive the first quantization of lrspps in the polaritonic regime . we study quantum statistics during propagation and characterize the performance of photon - to - lrspp quantum state transfer for single - photons , photon - number states and photonic coherent superposition states .
