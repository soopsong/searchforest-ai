we study the evolution of purity , entanglement and total correlations of general two -- mode gaussian states of continuous variable systems in arbitrary uncorrelated gaussian environments . the time evolution of purity , von neumann entropy , logarithmic negativity and mutual information is analyzed for a wide range of initial conditions . in general , we find that a local squeezing of the bath leads to a faster degradation of purity and entanglement , while it can help to preserve the mutual information between the modes .
