we demonstrate a vapor cell atomic clock prototype based on continuous - wave ( cw ) interrogation and double - modulation coherent population trapping ( dm - cpt ) technique . the dm - cpt technique uses a synchronous modulation of polarization and relative phase of a bi - chromatic laser beam in order to increase the number of atoms trapped in a dark state , i.e. a non - absorbing state . the narrow resonance , observed in transmission of a cs vapor cell , is used as a narrow frequency discriminator in an atomic clock . a detailed characterization of the cpt resonance versus numerous parameters is reported . a short - term frequency stability of $ 3.2 \times 10^{-13 } \tau^{-1/2}$ up to 100 s averaging time is measured . these performances are more than one order of magnitude better than industrial rb clocks and comparable to those of best laboratory - prototype vapor cell clocks . the noise budget analysis shows that the short and mid - term frequency stability is mainly limited by the power fluctuations of the microwave used to generate the bi - chromatic laser . these preliminary results demonstrate that the dm - cpt technique is well - suited for the development of a high - performance atomic clock , with potential compact and robust setup due to its linear architecture . this clock could find future applications in industry , telecommunications , instrumentation or global navigation satellite systems .
