the majority of recent works investigating the link between non - locality and randomness , e.g. in the context of device - independent cryptography , do so with respect to some specific bell inequality , usually the chsh inequality . however , the joint probabilities characterizing the measurement outcomes of a bell test are richer than just the degree of violation of a single bell inequality . in this work we show how to take this extra information into account in a systematic manner in order to optimally evaluate the randomness that can be certified from non - local correlations . we further show that taking into account the complete set of outcome probabilities is equivalent to optimizing over all possible bell inequalities , thereby allowing us to determine the optimal bell inequality for certifying the maximal amount of randomness from a given set of non - local correlations .
