closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) are intriguing relativistic objects that allow for time travel to the past and can be used as computational resources . in deutschian closed timelike curves ( d - ctcs ) , due to the monogamy of entanglement , non - local correlations between entangled states are destroyed . in contrast , for postselected closed timelike curves ( p - ctcs ) , a second variant of ctcs , the non - local correlations are preserved . p - ctcs can be harnessed for the signaling of non - orthogonal states to the past without a disruption of causality . in this paper , we take up signaling to the past and show a method of sending four non - orthogonal states to the past using p - ctcs . after constructing our signaling protocol , we study the causality violations that our protocol results in and put forward two consistency relations to prevent them .
