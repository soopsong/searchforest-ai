nonclassicality , entanglement , as well as dimensionality of a noisy twin beam are determined using characteristic function of the beam written in the fock basis . one - to - one correspondence between the negativity quantifying entanglement and the nonclassicality depth is revealed . twin beams , which are either entangled or nonclassical ( independent of their entanglement ) , are observed only for the limited degrees of noise that degrades their quantumness . dimensionality of the twin beam quantified by the participation ratio is compared with the dimensionality of entanglement determined from the negativity . the partition of the degrees of freedom of the twin beam into those related to entanglement and to noise is suggested . both single - mode and multimode twin beams are analyzed . weak nonclassicality based on integrated - intensity quasidistributions of multimode twin beams is studied . relation of the model to the experimental twin beams is discussed .
