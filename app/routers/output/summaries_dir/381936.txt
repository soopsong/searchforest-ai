we propose a non linear langevin equation as a model for stock market fluctuations and crashes . this equation is based on an identification of the different processes influencing the demand and supply , and their mathematical transcription . we emphasize the importance of feedback effects of price variations onto themselves . risk aversion , in particular , leads to an up - down symmetry breaking term which is responsible for crashes , where ` panic ' is self reinforcing . it is also responsible for the sudden collapse of speculative bubbles . interestingly , these crashes appear as rare , ` activated ' events , and have an exponentially small probability of occurence . we predict that the shape of the falldown of the price during a crash should be logarithmic . the normal regime , where the stock price exhibits behavior similar to that of a random walk , however reveals non trivial correlations on different time scales , in particular on the time scale over which operators perceive a change of trend .
