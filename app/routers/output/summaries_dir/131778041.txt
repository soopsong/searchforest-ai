we report on a discrete - time quantum walk that uses the momentum of ultra - cold rubidium-87 atoms as the walk space and two internal atomic states as the coin degree of freedom . each step of the walk consists of a coin toss ( a microwave pulse ) followed by a unitary shift operator ( a resonant ratchet pulse ) . we carry out a comprehensive experimental study on the effects of various parameters , including the strength of the shift operation , coin parameters , noise , and initialization of the system on the behavior of the walk . the walk dynamics can be well controlled in our experiment ; potential applications include atom interferometry and engineering asymmetric walks .
