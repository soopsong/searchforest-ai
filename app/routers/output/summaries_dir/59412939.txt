we present a direct experimental investigation of the optical field distribution around a suspended tapered optical nanofiber by means of a fluorescent scanning probe . using a 100 nm diameter fluorescent bead as a probe of the field intensity , we study interferences made by a nanofiber ( 400 nm diameter ) scattering a plane wave ( 568 nm wavelength ) . our scanning fluorescence near - field microscope maps the optical field over 36 $ \mu$m$^2 $ , with $ \lambda / 5 $ resolution , from contact with the surface of the nanofiber to a few micrometers away . comparison between experiments and mie scattering theory allows us to precisely determine the emitter - nanofiber distance and experimental drifts .
