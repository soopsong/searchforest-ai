the quantum autoencoder is a recent paradigm in the field of quantum machine learning , which may enable an enhanced use of resources in quantum technologies . to this end , quantum neural networks with less nodes in the inner than in the outer layers were considered . here , we propose a useful connection between approximate quantum adders and quantum autoencoders . specifically , this link allows us to employ optimized approximate quantum adders , obtained with genetic algorithms , for the implementation of quantum autoencoders for a variety of initial states . furthermore , we can also directly optimize the quantum autoencoders via genetic algorithms . our approach opens a different path for the design of quantum autoencoders in controllable quantum platforms .
