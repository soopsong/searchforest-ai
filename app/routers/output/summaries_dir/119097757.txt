we discuss cryptographic applications of single - qubit rotations from the perspective of trapdoor one - way functions and public - key encryption . in particular , we present an asymmetric cryptosystem whose security relies on fundamental principles of quantum physics . a quantum public key is used for the encryption of messages while decryption is possible by means of a classical private key only . the trapdoor one - way function underlying the proposed cryptosystem maps integer numbers to quantum states of a qubit and its inversion can be infeasible by virtue of the holevo 's theorem .
