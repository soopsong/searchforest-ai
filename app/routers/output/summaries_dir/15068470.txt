we analyse the use of entangled states to perform quantum computations non locally among distant nodes in a quantum network . the complexity associated with the generation of multiparticle entangled states is quantified in terms of the concept of global cost . this parameter allows us to compare the use of physical resources in different schemes . we show that for ideal channels and for a sufficiently large number of nodes , the use of maximally entangled states is advantageous over uncorrelated ones . for noisy channels , one has to use entanglement purification procedures in order to create entangled states of high fidelity . we show that under certain circumstances a quantum network supplied with a maximally entangled input still yields a smaller global cost , provided that $ n$ belongs to a given interval $ n\in [ n_{min},n_{max}]$. the values of $ n_{min}$ and $ n_{max}$ crucially depend on the purification protocols used to establish the $ n$-- processor entangled states , as well as on the presence of decoherence processes during the computation . the phase estimation problem has been used to illustrate this fact .
