scalability from single qubit operations to multi - qubit circuits for quantum information processing requires architecture - specific implementations . semiconductor hybrid qubit architecture is a suitable candidate to realize large scale quantum information processing , as it combines a universal set of logic gates with fast and all - electrical manipulation of qubits . we propose an implementation of hybrid qubits , based on si metal - oxide - semiconductor ( mos ) quantum dots , compatible with the cmos industrial technologic standards . we discuss the realization of multi - qubit circuits capable of fault - tolerant computation and quantum error correction , by evaluating the time and space resources needed for their implementation . as a result , the maximum density of quantum information is extracted from a circuit including 8 logical qubits encoded by the [ [ 7,1,3 ] ] steane code . the corresponding surface density of logical qubits is 2.6 mqubit / cm$^2$.
