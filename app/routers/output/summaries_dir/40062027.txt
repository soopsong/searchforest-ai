a recent proposal has shown that it is possible to perform linear - optics quantum computation using a ballistic generation of the lattice . yet , due to the probabilistic generation of its cluster state , it is not possible to use the fault - tolerant raussendorf lattice , which requires a lower failure rate during the entanglement - generation process . previous work in this area showed proof - of - principle linear - optics quantum computation , while this paper presents an approach to it which is more practical , satisfying several key constraints . we develop a classical measurement scheme , that purifies a large faulty lattice to a smaller lattice with entanglement faults below threshold . a single application of this method can reduce the entanglement error rate to $ 7\%$ for an input failure rate of $ 25\%$. thus , we can show that it is possible to achieve fault tolerance for ballistic methods .
