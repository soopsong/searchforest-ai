we present a design methodology and analysis of a cavity optomechanical system in which a localized ghz frequency mechanical mode of a nanobeam resonator is evanescently coupled to a high quality factor ( q>10 ^ 6 ) optical mode of a separate nanobeam optical cavity . using separate nanobeams provides flexibility , enabling the independent design and optimization of the optics and mechanics of the system . in addition , the small gap ( approx . 25 nm ) between the two resonators gives rise to a slot mode effect that enables a large zero - point optomechanical coupling strength to be achieved , with g/2pi>300 khz in a si3n4 system at 980 nm and g/2pi approx . 900 khz in a si system at 1550 nm . the fact that large coupling strengths to ghz mechanical oscillators can be achieved in sin is important , as this material has a broad optical transparency window , which allows operation throughout the visible and near - infrared . as an application of this platform , we consider wide - band optical frequency conversion between 1300 nm and 980 nm , using two optical nanobeam cavities coupled on either side to the breathing mode of a mechanical nanobeam resonator .
