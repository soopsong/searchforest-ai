the whispering gallery modes ( wgms ) of quartz microspheres are investigated for the purpose of strong coupling between single photons and atoms in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) . within our current understanding of the loss mechanisms of the wgms , the saturation photon number , n , and critical atom number , n , can not be minimized simultaneously , so that an"optimal"sphere size is taken to be the radius for which the geometric mean , ( n x n)^(1/2 ) , is minimized . while a general treatment is given for the dimensionless parameters used to characterize the atom - cavity system , detailed consideration is given to the d2 transition in atomic cesium ( 852 nm ) using fused - silica microspheres , for which the maximum coupling coefficient g/(2*pi)=750mhz occurs for a sphere radius a=3.63microns corresponding to the minimum for n=6.06x10^(-6 ) . by contrast , the minimum for n=9.00x10^(-6 ) occurs for a sphere radius of a=8.12microns , while the optimal sphere size for which ( n x n)^(1/2 ) is minimized occurs at a=7.83microns . on an experimental front , we have fabricated fused - silica microspheres with radii a=10microns and consistently observed quality factors q=0.8x10^(7 ) . these results for the wgms are compared with corresponding parameters achieved in fabry - perot cavities to demonstrate the significant potential of microspheres as a tool for cavity qed with strong coupling .
