the dynamics of two variants of quantum fisher information under decoherence are investigated from a geometrical point of view . we first derive the explicit formulas of these two quantities for a single qubit in terms of the bloch vector . moreover , we obtain analytical results for them under three different decoherence channels , which are expressed as affine transformation matrices . using the hierarchy equation method , we numerically study the dynamics of both the two information in a dissipative model and compare the numerical results with the analytical ones obtained by applying the rotating - wave approximation . we further express the two information quantities in terms of the bloch vector for a qudit , by expanding the density matrix and hermitian operators in a common set of generators of the lie algebra $ \mathfrak{su}(d)$. by calculating the dynamical quantum fisher information , we find that the collisional dephasing significantly diminishes the precision of phase parameter with the ramsey interferometry .
