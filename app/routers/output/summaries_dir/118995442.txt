the paper explores the fundamental physical principles of quantum mechanics ( in fact , quantum field theory ) which limit the bit rate for long distances . propagation of photons in optical fibers is modeled using methods of quantum electrodynamics . we define photon"duration"as the standard deviation of the photon arrival time ; we find its asymptotics for long distances and then obtain the main result of the paper : the linear dependence of photon duration on the distance . this effect puts the limit to joint increasing of the photon flux and the distance from the source and it has important consequences both for quantum information technologies and quantum foundations . once quantum communication develops into a real technology , it would be appealing to the engineers to increase both the photon flux and the distance . and here our"photon flux / distance effect"has to be taken into account ( at least if successively emitted photons are considered as independent ) . this effect also has to be taken into account in a loophole free test of bell 's type -- to close jointly the detection and locality loopholes .
