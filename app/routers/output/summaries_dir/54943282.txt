motivated by recent progress in the experimental manipulation of cold atoms in optical lattices , we study three different protocols for non - adiabatic quantum state preparation and state transport in chains of rydberg atoms . the protocols we discuss are based on the blockade mechanism between atoms which , when excited to a rydberg state , interact through a van der waals potential , and rely on single - site addressing . specifically , we discuss protocols for efficient creation of an antiferromagnetic ghz state , a class of matrix product states including a so - called rydberg crystal and for the state transport of a single - qubit quantum state between two ends of a chain of atoms . we identify system parameters allowing for the operation of the protocols on timescales shorter than the lifetime of the rydberg states while yielding high fidelity output states . we discuss the effect of positional disorder on the resulting states and comment on limitations due to other sources of noise such as radiative decay of the rydberg states . the proposed protocols provide a testbed for benchmarking the performance of quantum information processing platforms based on rydberg atoms .
