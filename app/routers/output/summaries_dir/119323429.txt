we study a quantum walk ( qw ) whose time evolution is induced by a random walk ( rw ) first introduced by szegedy ( 2004 ) . we focus on a relation between recurrent properties of the rw and localization of the corresponding qw . we find the following two fundamental derivations of localization of the qw . the first one is the set of all the $ \ell^2 $ summable eigenvectors of the corresponding rw . the second one is the orthogonal complement , whose eigenvalues are $ \pm 1 $ , of the subspace induced by the rw . in particular , as a consequence , for an infinite half line , we show that localization of the qw can be ensured by the positive recurrence of the corresponding rws , and also that the existence of only one self loop affects localization properties .
