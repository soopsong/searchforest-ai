electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) has been extensively studied in various systems . however , it is not easy to observe in superconducting quantum circuits ( sqcs ) , because the rabi frequency of the strong controlling field corresponding to eit is limited by the decay rates of the sqcs . here , we show that eit can be achieved by engineering decay rates in a superconducting circuit qed system through a classical driving field on the qubit . without such a driving field , the superconducting qubit and the cavity field are approximately decoupled in the large detuning regime , and thus the eigenstates of the system are approximately product states of the cavity field and qubit states . however , the driving field can strongly mix these product states and so - called polariton states can be formed . the weights of the states for the qubit and cavity field in the polariton states can be tuned by the driving field , and thus the decay rates of the polariton states can be changed . we choose a three - level system with $ \lambda$-type transitions in such a driven circuit qed system , and demonstrate how eit and ats can be realized in this compound system . we believe that this study will be helpful for eit experiments using sqcs .
