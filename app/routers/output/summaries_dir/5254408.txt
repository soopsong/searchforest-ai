this paper deals with different ways to extract the effective two - dimensional lower level dynamics of a lambda system excited by off - resonant laser beams . we present a commonly used procedure for elimination of the upper level , and we show that it may lead to ambiguous results . to overcome this problem and better understand the applicability conditions of this scheme , we review two rigorous methods which allow us both to derive an unambiguous effective two - level hamiltonian of the system and to quantify the accuracy of the approximation achieved : the first one relies on the exact solution of the schrodinger equation , while the second one resorts to the green 's function formalism and the feshbach projection operator technique .
