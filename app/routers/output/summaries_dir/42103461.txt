reversible logic has two main properties . first , the number of inputs is equal to the number of outputs . second , it implements a one - to - one mapping ; i.e. , one can reconstruct the inputs from the outputs . these properties enable its applications in building quantum computing architectures . in this paper , we study reverse engineering of reversible logic circuits , including reverse engineering of non - reversible functions embedded into reversible circuits . we propose the number of embeddings of non - reversible functions into a reversible circuit as the security metric for reverse engineering . we analyze the security benefits of automatic synthesis of reversible circuits . we use our proposed security metric to show that the functional synthesis approaches yield reversible circuits that are more resilient to reverse engineering than the structural synthesis approaches . finally , we propose scrambling of the inputs and outputs of a reversible circuit to thwart reverse engineering .
