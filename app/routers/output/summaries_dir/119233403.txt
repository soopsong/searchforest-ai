we present a filtered backprojection algorithm for reconstructing the wigner function of a system of large angular momentum j from stern - gerlach - type measurements . our method is advantageous over the full determination of the density matrix in that it is insensitive to experimental fluctuations in j , and allows for a natural elimination of high - frequency noise in the wigner function by taking into account the experimental uncertainties in the determination of j , its projection m , and the quantization axis orientation . no data binning and no arbitrary smoothing parameters are necessary in this reconstruction . using recently published data [ riedel et al . , nature 464:1170 ( 2010 ) ] we reconstruct the wigner function of a spin - squeezed state of a bose - einstein condensate of about 1250 atoms , demonstrating that measurements along quantization axes lying in a single plane are sufficient for performing this tomographic reconstruction . our method does not guarantee positivity of the reconstructed density matrix in the presence of experimental noise , which is a general limitation of backprojection algorithms .
