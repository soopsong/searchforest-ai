we consider the security of practical continuous - variable quantum key distribution implementation with the local oscillator ( lo ) fluctuating in time , which opens a loophole for eve to intercept the secret key . we show that eve can simulate this fluctuation to hide her gaussian collective attack by reducing the intensity of the lo . numerical simulations demonstrate that , if bob does not monitor the lo intensity and does not scale his measurements with the instantaneous intensity values of lo , the secret key rate will be compromised severely .
