we consider error correction procedures designed specifically for the amplitude damping channel . we analyze amplitude damping errors in the stabilizer formalism . this analysis allows a generalization of the [ 4,1 ] ` approximate ' amplitude damping code of quant - ph/9704002 . we present this generalization as a class of [ 2(m+1),m ] codes and present quantum circuits for encoding and recovery operations . we also present a [ 7,3 ] amplitude damping code based on the classical hamming code . all of these are stabilizer codes whose encoding and recovery operations can be completely described with clifford group operations . finally , we describe optimization options in which recovery operations may be further adapted according to the damping probability gamma .
