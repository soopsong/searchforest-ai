we generate nonclassical conditional states by exploiting the quantum correlations of multi - mode twin - beam states endowed with a sizeable number of photons . a strong relation between the sub - shot - noise correlations exhibited by twin beams and the sub - poissonian character of the conditional states is experimentally revealed . it determines optimal conditions for sub - poissonian light generation .
