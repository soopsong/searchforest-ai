we study the small - mass ( overdamped ) limit of langevin equations for a particle in a potential and/or magnetic field with matrix - valued and state - dependent drift and diffusion . the present work generalizes prior derivations of the homogenized equation for the position degrees of freedom in the $ m\to 0 $ limit . specifically , we develop a hierarchy of approximate equations for the position degrees of freedom that achieves accuracy of order $ m^{\ell/2}$ over compact time intervals for any $ \ell\in\mathbb{z}^+$. the results cover bounded forces , for which we prove convergence in $ l^p$ norms , and unbounded forces , in which case we prove convergence in probability .
