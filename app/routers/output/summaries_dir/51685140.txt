we study a protocol for constructing a squeezed atom laser for a model originating from the generalized uncertainty principle . we show that the squeezing effects arising from such systems do not require any squeezed light as an input , but the squeezing appears automatically because of the structure of the model it owns . the output atom laser beam becomes squeezed due to the nonlinear interaction between the bose - einstein condensate and the deformed radiation field created due to the noncommutative structure . we analyze several standard squeezing techniques based on the analytical expressions followed by a numerical analysis for further insights .
