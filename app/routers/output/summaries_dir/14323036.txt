photonic quantum systems are among the most promising architectures for quantum computers . it is well known that for dual - rail photons effective non - linearities and near - deterministic non - trivial two - qubit gates can be achieved via the measurement process and by introducing ancillary photons . while in principle this opens a legitimate path to scalable linear optical quantum computing , the technical requirements are still very challenging and thus other optical encodings are being actively investigated . one of the alternatives is to use single - rail encoded photons , where entangled states can be deterministically generated . here we prove that even for such systems universal optical quantum computing using only passive optical elements such as beam splitters and phase shifters is not possible . this no - go theorem proves that photon bunching can not be passively suppressed even when extra ancilla modes and arbitrary number of photons are used . our result provides useful guidance for the design of optical quantum computers .
