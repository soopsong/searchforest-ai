we present a novel approach to precisely synthesize arbitrary polarization states of light with a high modulation bandwidth . our approach consists of superimposing two laser light fields with the same wavelength , but with opposite circular polarizations , where the phase and the amplitude of each light field are individually controlled . we find that the polarization - synthesized beam reaches a degree of polarization of 99.99 % , which is mainly limited by static spatial variations of the polarization state over the beam profile . we also find that the depolarization caused by temporal fluctuations of the polarization state is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller . in a recent work , robens et al . [ phys . rev . lett . 118 , 065302 ( 2017 ) ] demonstrated an application of the polarization synthesizer to create two independently controllable optical lattices , which trap atoms depending on their internal spin state . we here use ultracold atoms in polarization - synthesized optical lattices to give an independent , in situ demonstration of the performance of the polarization synthesizer .
