we study the possibility of producing and detecting continuous variable cluster states in an optical set - up in an extremely compact fashion . this method is based on a multi - pixel homodyne detection system recently demonstrated experimentally , which includes classical data post - processing . it allows to incorporate the linear optics network , usually employed in standard experiments for the production of cluster states , in the stage of the measurement . after giving an example of cluster state generation by this method , we further study how this procedure can be generalized to perform gaussian quantum computation .
