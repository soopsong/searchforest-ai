an approximate analytical solution is presented , along with numerical calculations , for a system of two single - photon wavepackets interacting via an ideal , localized kerr medium . it is shown that , because of spontaneous emission into the initially unoccupied temporal modes , the cross - phase modulation in the schrodinger picture is very small as long as the spectral width of the single - photon pulses is well within the medium 's bandwidth . in this limit , the hamiltonian used can be derived from the"giant kerr effect"for a four - level atom , under conditions of electromagnetically - induced transparency ; it is shown explicitly that the linear absorption in this system increases as the pulse 's spectral width approaches the medium 's transparency bandwidth , and hence , as long as the absorption probability remains small , the maximum cross - phase modulation is limited to essentially useless values . these results are in agreement with the general , causality- and unitarity - based arguments of shapiro and co - workers .
