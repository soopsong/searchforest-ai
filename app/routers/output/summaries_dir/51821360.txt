we investigate the quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement of an atomic population based on a heterodyne detection and show that the induced back - action allows to prepare both spin - squeezed and dicke states . we use a wavevector formalism to describe the stochastic process of the measurement and the associated atomic evolution . analytical formulas of the atomic distribution momenta are derived in the weak coupling regime both for short and long time behavior , and they are in good agreement with those obtained by a monte - carlo simulation . the experimental implementation of the proposed heterodyne detection scheme is discussed . the role played in the squeezing process by the spontaneous emission is considered .
