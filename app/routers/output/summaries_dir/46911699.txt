inspired by creation of a fast exchange - only qubit ( medford et al . , phys . rev . lett . , 111 , 050501 ( 2013 ) ) , we develop a theory describing the nonlinear dynamics of two such qubits that are capacitively coupled , when one of them is driven resonantly at a frequency equal to its level splitting . we include conditions of strong driving , where the rabi frequency is a significant fraction of the level splitting , and we consider situations where the splitting for the second qubit may be the same or different than the first . we demonstrate that coupling between qubits can be detected by reading the response of the second qubit , even when the coupling between them is only of about $ 1\%$ of their level splittings , and calculate entanglement between qubits . patterns of nonlinear dynamics of coupled qubits and their entanglement are strongly dependent on the geometry of the system , and the specific mechanism of inter - qubit coupling deeply influences dynamics of both qubits . in particular , we describe the development of irregular dynamics in a two - qubit system , explore approaches for inhibiting it , and demonstrate existence of an optimal range of coupling strength maintaining stability during the operational time .
