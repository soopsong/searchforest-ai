we show how to implement a rindler transformation of coordinates with an embedded quantum simulator . a suitable mapping allows to realise the unphysical operation in the simulated dynamics by implementing a quantum gate on an enlarged quantum system . this enhances the versatility of embedded quantum simulators by extending the possible in - situ changes of reference frames to the non - inertial realm .
