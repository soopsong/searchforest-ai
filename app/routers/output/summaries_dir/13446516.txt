we present a square root law for active sensing of phase $ \theta$ of a single pixel using optical probes that pass through a single - mode lossy thermal - noise bosonic channel . specifically , we show that , when the sensor uses an $ n$-mode covert optical probe , the mean squared error ( mse ) of the resulting estimator $ \hat{\theta}_n$ scales as $ \langle ( \theta-\hat{\theta}_n)^2\rangle=\mathcal{o}(1/\sqrt{n})$ ; improving the scaling necessarily leads to detection by the adversary with high probability . we fully characterize this limit and show that it is achievable using laser light illumination and a heterodyne receiver , even when the adversary captures every photon that does not return to the sensor and performs arbitrarily complex measurement as permitted by the laws of quantum mechanics .
