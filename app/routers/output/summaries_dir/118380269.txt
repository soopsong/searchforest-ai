we consider the jaynes - cummings model describing the interaction of a cooper pair box ( cpb ) and a nanoresonator ( nr ) in the presence of a kerr medium and losses the evolution of the entropy of both subsystems and the cpb population inversion were calculated numerically . it is found that these properties increase when the nr frequency is time - dependent , even in the presence of losses ; the effect is very sensitive to detuning and disappears in the resonant regime . the roles played by the losses affecting the cpb and the nr are also compared .
