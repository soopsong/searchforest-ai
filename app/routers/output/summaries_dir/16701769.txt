we study some consequences of noncommutativity to homogeneous cosmologies by introducing a deformation of the commutation relation between the minisuperspace variables . the investigation is carried out for the kantowski - sachs model by means of a comparative study of the universe evolution in four different scenarios : the classical commutative , classical noncommutative , quantum commutative , and quantum noncommutative . the comparison is rendered transparent by the use of the bohmian formalism of quantum trajectories . as a result of our analysis , we found that noncommutativity can modify significantly the universe evolution , but can not alter its singular behavior in the classical context . quantum effects , on the other hand , can originate non - singular periodic universes in both commutative and noncommutative cases . the quantum noncommutative model is shown to present interesting properties , as the capability to give rise to non - trivial dynamics in situations where its commutative counterpart is necessarily static .
