we formulate a new class of two - person zero - sum differential games , in a stochastic setting , where a specification on a target terminal state distribution is imposed on the players . we address such added specification by introducing incentives to the game that guides the players to steer the join distribution accordingly . in the present paper , we only address linear quadratic games with gaussian target distribution . the solution is characterized by a coupled riccati equations system , resembling that in the standard linear quadratic differential games . indeed , once the incentive function is calculated , our problem reduces to a standard one . tthe framework developed in this paper extends previous results in covariance control , a fast growing research area . on the numerical side , problems herein are reformulated as convex - concave minimax problems for which efficient and reliable algorithms are available .
