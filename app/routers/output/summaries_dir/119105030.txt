we apply the dirac - bergmann algorithm for the analysis of constraints to gauge theories defined on spherically symmetric black hole backgrounds . we find that the constraints for a given theory are modified on such spacetimes through the presence of additional contributions from the horizon . as a concrete example , we consider the maxwell field on a black hole background , and determine the role of the horizon contributions on the dynamics of the theory .
