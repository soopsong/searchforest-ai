this paper considers the problem of implementing a previously proposed direct coupling quantum observer for a closed linear quantum system . this observer is shown to be able to estimate some but not all of the plant variables in a time averaged sense . the paper proposes a possible experimental implementation of the observer plant system using a non - degenerate parametric amplifier .
