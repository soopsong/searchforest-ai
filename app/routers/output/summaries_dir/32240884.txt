a system scheme is presented which allows non - reciprocal wave transmission or directional amplification of electromagnetic signals , using a boxed four - node method . edges represent strong hopping interactions and diagonals stand for weak parametric interactions . using careful optimization of values for design parameters , we are able to obtain non - reciprocity in excess of 12db and 130db for intrinsic and extrinsic configurations at identical input / output frequencies . for the directional amplification , an isolation as high as 40db is demonstrated with forward / backward gains of $ \pm$20db . cascading two such systems potentially can offer high isolations at high gains .
