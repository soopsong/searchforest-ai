in counterfactual quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , two remote parties can securely share random polarization - encoded bits through the blocking rather than the transmission of particles . we propose a semi - counterfactual qkd , i.e. , one where the secret bit is shared , and also encoded , based on the blocking or non - blocking of a particle . the scheme is thus semi - counterfactual and not based on polarization encoding . as with other counterfactual schemes and the goldenberg - vaidman protocol , but unlike bb84 , the encoding states are orthogonal and security arises ultimately from single - particle non - locality . unlike any of them , however , the secret bit generated is maximally indeterminate until the joint action of alice and bob . we prove the general security of the protocol , and study the most general photon - number - preserving incoherent attack in detail .
