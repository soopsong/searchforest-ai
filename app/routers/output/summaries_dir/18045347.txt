we propose a dressed - state scheme to achieve shortcuts to adiabaticity in atom - cavity quantum electrodynamics for speeding up adiabatic two - atom quantum state transfer and maximum entanglement generation . compared with stimulated raman adiabatic passage , the dressed - state scheme greatly shortens the operation time in a non - adiabatic way . by means of some numerical simulations , we determine the parameters which can guarantee the feasibility and efficiency both in theory and experiment . besides , numerical simulations also show the scheme is robust against the variations in the parameters , atomic spontaneous emissions and the photon leakages from the cavity .
