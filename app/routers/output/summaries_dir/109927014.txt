we discuss reservoir induced phase transitions of lattice fermions in the non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) of an open system with local reservoirs . these systems may become critical in the sense of a diverging correlation length upon changing the reservoir coupling . we here show that the transition to a critical state is associated with a vanishing gap in the damping spectrum . it is shown that although in linear systems there can be a transition to a critical state there is no reservoir - induced quantum phase transition between distinct phases with non - vanishing damping gap . we derive the static and dynamical critical exponents corresponding to the transition to a critical state and show that their possible values , defining universality classes of reservoir - induced phase transitions are determined by the coupling range of the independent local reservoirs . if a reservoir couples to n neighboring lattice sites , the critical exponent can assume all fractions from 1 to 1/(n - 1 ) .
