we analyse a system composed of a qubit coupled to electromagnetic fields of two high quality quantum oscillators . particular realization of such a system is the superconducting qubit coupled to a transmission - line resonator driven by two signals with frequencies close to the resonator 's harmonics . one strong signal is used for exciting the system to a high energetic state while the second weak signal is applied for probing effective eigenstates of the system . we demonstrate that a description of the system dynamics as doubly dressed qubit is applicable . experiments show that in the case of high quality resonators the energy levels and the resonance conditions can be probed even for high driving amplitudes . the interaction of the qubit with photons of two harmonics has prospects to be used as a quantum amplifier or an attenuator .
