recently , there are comparable revised interests in bubble nucleation seeded by black holes . however , it is debated in the literature that whether one shall interpret a static bounce solution in the euclidean schwarzschild spacetime ( with periodic euclidean schwarzschild time ) as describing a false vacuum decay at zero temperature or at finite temperature . in this paper , we show a correspondence that the static bounce solution describes either a thermal transition of vacuum in the static region outside of a schwarzschild black hole or a quantum transition in a maximally extended kruskal - szekeres spacetime , corresponding to the viewpoint of the external static observers or the freely falling observers , respectively . the matsubara modes in the thermal interpretation can be mapped to the circular harmonic modes from an $ o(2)$ symmetry in the tunneling interpretation . the complementary tunneling interpretation must be given in the kruskal - szekeres spacetime because of the so - called thermofield dynamics . this correspondence is general for bubble nucleation around horizons . we propose a new paradox related to black holes as a consequence of this correspondence .
