we evaluate the performance of quantum arithmetic algorithms run on a distributed quantum computer ( a quantum multicomputer ) . we vary the node capacity and i / o capabilities , and the network topology . the tradeoff of choosing between gates executed remotely , through ` ` teleported gates ' ' on entangled pairs of qubits ( telegate ) , versus exchanging the relevant qubits via quantum teleportation , then executing the algorithm using local gates ( teledata ) , is examined . we show that the teledata approach performs better , and that carry - ripple adders perform well when the teleportation block is decomposed so that the key quantum operations can be parallelized . a node size of only a few logical qubits performs adequately provided that the nodes have two transceiver qubits . a linear network topology performs acceptably for a broad range of system sizes and performance parameters . we therefore recommend pursuing small , high - i / o bandwidth nodes and a simple network . such a machine will run shor 's algorithm for factoring large numbers efficiently .
