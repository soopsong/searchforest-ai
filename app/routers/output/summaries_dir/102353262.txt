we use the formalism of geodesic witten diagrams to study the holographic realization of the conformal block expansion for entanglement entropy of two disjoint intervals . the agreement between the ryu - takayanagi formula and the identity block contribution has a dual realization as the product of bulk to boundary propagators . quantum bulk corrections instead arise from stripped higher order diagrams and back - reaction effects ; these are also mapped to the structure for $ g_n^0 $ terms found in \cite{faulkner:2013ana } , with the former identified as the bulk entanglement entropy across the ryu - takayanagi surfaces . an independent derivation of this last statement is provided by implementing a twist - line formalism in the bulk , and additional checks from the computation of mutual information and single interval entanglement entropy . finally an interesting correspondence is found between the recently proposed holographic entanglement of purification , and an approximated form for certain $ 1 / c$ renyi entropies corrections .
