in the present paper we study the minimization of energy integrals on the sphere with a focus on an interesting clustering phenomenon : for certain types of potentials , optimal measures are discrete or are supported on small sets . in particular , we prove that the support of any minimizer of the $ p$-frame energy has empty interior whenever $ p$ is not an even integer . a similar effect is also demonstrated for energies with analytic potentials which are not positive definite . in addition , we establish the existence of discrete minimizers for a large class of energies , which includes energies with polynomial potentials .
