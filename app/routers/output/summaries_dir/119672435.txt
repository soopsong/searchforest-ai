we investigate the utility of geometric ( clifford ) algebras ( ga ) methods in two specific applications to quantum information science . first , using the multiparticle spacetime algebra ( msta , the geometric algebra of a relativistic configuration space ) , we present an explicit algebraic description of one and two - qubit quantum states together with a msta characterization of one and two - qubit quantum computational gates . second , using the above mentioned characterization and the ga description of the lie algebras so(3 ) and su(2 ) based on the rotor group spin+(3 , 0 ) formalism , we reexamine boykin 's proof of universality of quantum gates . we conclude that the msta approach does lead to a useful conceptual unification where the complex qubit space and the complex space of unitary operators acting on them become united , with both being made just by multivectors in real space . finally , the ga approach to rotations based on the rotor group does bring conceptual and computational advantages compared to standard vectorial and matricial approaches .
