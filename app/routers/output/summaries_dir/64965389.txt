typical quantum gate tomography protocols struggle with a self - consistency problem : the gate operation can not be reconstructed without knowledge of the initial state and final measurement , but such knowledge can not be obtained without well - characterized gates . a recently proposed technique , known as randomized benchmarking tomography ( rbt ) , sidesteps this self - consistency problem by designing experiments to be insensitive to preparation and measurement imperfections . we implement this proposal in a superconducting qubit system , using a number of experimental improvements including implementing each of the elements of the clifford group in single ` atomic ' pulses and custom control hardware to enable large overhead protocols . we show a robust reconstruction of several single - qubit quantum gates , including a unitary outside the clifford group . we demonstrate that rbt yields physical gate reconstructions that are consistent with fidelities obtained by randomized benchmarking .
