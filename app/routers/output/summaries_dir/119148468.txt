in this work we recall the definition of matrix immanants , a generalization of the determinant and permanent of a matrix . we use them to generalize families of symmetric and antisymmetric orbit functions related to weyl groups of the simple lie algebras $ a_n$. the new functions and their properties are described , in particular we give their continuous orthogonality relations . several examples are shown .
