we introduce the driven discrete time quantum walk , where walkers are added during the walk instead of only at the beginning . this leads to interference in walker number and very different dynamics when compared to the original quantum walk . these dynamics have two regimes , which we illustrate using the one - dimensional line . then , we explore a search application which has certain advantages over current search protocols , namely that it does not require a complicated initial state nor a specific measurement time to observe the marked state . finally , we describe a potential experimental implementation using existing technology .
