we study the asymmetric zero - range process ( zrp ) with l sites and open boundaries , conditioned to carry an atypical current . using a generalized doob h - transform we compute explicitly the transition rates of an effective process for which the conditioned dynamics are typical . this effective process is a zero - range process with renormalized hopping rates , which are space dependent even when the original rates are constant . this leads to non - trivial density profiles in the steady state of the conditioned dynamics , and , under generic conditions on the jump rates of the unconditioned zrp , to an intriguing supercritical bulk region where condensates can grow . these results provide a microscopic perspective on macroscopic fluctuation theory ( mft ) for the weakly asymmetric case : it turns out that the predictions of mft remain valid in the non - rigorous limit of finite asymmetry . in addition , the microscopic results yield the correct scaling factor for the asymmetry that mft can not predict .
