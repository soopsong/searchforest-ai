a nonlocal subspace $ \mathcal{h}_{ns}$ is a subspace within the hilbert space $ \mathcal{h}_n$ of a multi - particle system such that every state $ \psi \in \mathcal{h}_{ns}$ violates a given bell inequality $ \mathcal{b}$. subspace $ \mathcal{h}_{ns}$ is maximally nonlocal if each such state $ \psi$ violates $ \mathcal{b}$ to its algebraic maximum . we propose ways by which states with a stabilizer structure of graph states can be used to construct maximally nonlocal subspaces , essentially as a degenerate eigenspace of bell operators derived from the stabilizer generators . two cryptographic applications-- to quantum information splitting and quantum subspace certification-- are discussed .
