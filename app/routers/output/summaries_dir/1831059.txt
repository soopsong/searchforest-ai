we consider extended starlike networks where the hub node is coupled with several chains of nodes representing star rays . assuming that nodes of the network are occupied by nonidentical self - oscillators we study various forms of their cluster synchronization . radial cluster emerges when the nodes are synchronized along a ray , while circular cluster is formed by nodes without immediate connections but located on identical distances to the hub . by its nature the circular synchronization is a new manifestation of so called remote synchronization [ phys . rev . e 85 ( 2012 ) , 026208 ] . we report its long - range form when the synchronized nodes interact through at least three intermediate nodes . forms of long - range remote synchronization are elements of scenario of transition to the total synchronization of the network . we observe that the far ends of rays synchronize first . then more circular clusters appear involving closer to hub nodes . subsequently the clusters merge and , finally , all network become synchronous . behavior of the extended starlike networks is found to be strongly determined by the ray length , while varying the number of rays basically affects fine details of a dynamical picture . symmetry of the star also extensively influences the dynamics . in an asymmetric star circular cluster mainly vanish in favor of radial ones , however , long - range remote synchronization survives .
