by considering matter wave bright solitons from weakly coupled bose - einstein condensates trapped in a double - well potential , we study the formation of macroscopic non - classical states , including schr\"odinger - cat superposition states and maximally path entangled $ n00n$-states . with these macroscopic states , we examine mach - zehnder interferometer in the context of parity measurements , in order to obtain heisenberg limit accuracy for linear phase shift measurement . we reveal that the ratio between two - body scattering length and intra - well hopping parameter can be measured with the scaling beyond this limit by using nonlinear phase shift with interacting quantum solitons .
