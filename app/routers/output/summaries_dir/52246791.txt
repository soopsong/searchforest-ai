we describe a method to tune , in - situ , between transverse and longitudinal light - matter coupling in a hybrid circuit - qed device composed of an electron spin degree of freedom coupled to a microwave transmission line cavity . our approach relies on periodic modulation of the coupling itself , such that in a certain frame the interaction is both amplified and either transverse , or , by modulating at two frequencies , longitudinal . the former realizes an effective simulation of certain aspects of the ultra - strong coupling regime , while the latter allows one to implement a longitudinal readout scheme even when the intrinsic hamiltonian is transverse , and the individual spin or cavity frequencies can not be changed . we analyze the fidelity of using such a scheme to measure the state of the electron spin degree of freedom , and argue that the longitudinal readout scheme can operate in regimes where the traditional dispersive approach fails .
