we investigate experimentally a cascade of temperature - compensated unequal - path interferometers that can be used to measure frequency states in a high - dimensional quantum distribution system . in particular , we demonstrate that commercially - available interferometers have sufficient environmental isolation so that they maintain an interference visibility greater than 98.5\% at a wavelength of 1550 nm over extended periods with only moderate passive control of the interferometer temperature ( $ < \pm0.50 ^{\circ}$c ) . specifically , we characterize two interferometers that have matched delays : one with a free - spectral range of 2.5 ghz , and the other with 1.25 ghz . we find that the relative path of these interferometers drifts less than 3~nm over a period of one hour during which the temperature fluctuates by $ < \pm$0.10 $ ^{\circ } $ c. when we purposely heat the interferometers over a temperature range of 20 - 50 $ ^{\circ}$c , we find that the temperature sensitivity is different for each interferometer , likely due to slight manufacturing errors during the temperature compensation procedure . over this range , we measure a path - length shift of 26 $ \pm$ 9 nm/$^{\circ } $ c for the 2.5 ghz interferometer . for the 1.25 ghz interferometer , the path - length shift is nonlinear and is locally equal to zero at a temperature of 37.1 $ ^{\circ}$c and is 50 $ \pm$ 17 nm/$^{\circ } $ c at 22 $ ^{\circ}$c . with these devices , we realize a cascade of 1.25 ghz and 2.5 ghz interferometers to measure four - dimensional classical frequency states created by modulating a stable and continuous - wave laser . we observe a visibility $ > 99\%$ over an hour , which is mainly limited by our ability to precisely generate these states . overall , our results indicate that these interferometers are well suited for realistic time - frequency quantum distribution protocols .
