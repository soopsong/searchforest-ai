in this paper , we study decoherence on grover 's quantum searching algorithm using a perturbative method . we assume that each two - state system ( qubit ) suffers \sigma_{z } error with probability p ( 0\leq p\leq 1 ) independently at every step in the algorithm . considering an n - qubit density operator to which grover 's operation is applied m times , we expand it in powers of 2mnp and derive its matrix element order by order under the n\to \infty limit . ( in this large n limit , we assume p is small enough , so that 2mnp(\geq 0 ) can take any real positive value or 0 . ) this approach gives us an interpretation about creation of new modes caused by \sigma_{z } error and an asymptotic form of an arbitrary order correction . calculating the matrix element up to the fifth order term numerically , we investigate a region of 2mnp ( perturbative parameter ) where the algorithm finds the correct item with a threshold of probability p_{th } or more . it satisfies 2mnp<(8/5)(1-p_{th } ) around 2mnp\simeq 0 and p_{th}\simeq 1 , and this linear relation is applied to a wide range of p_{th } approximately . this observation is similar to a result obtained by e. bernstein and u. vazirani concerning accuracy of quantum gates for general algorithms . we can not investigate a quantum to classical phase transition of the algorithm , because it is outside the reliable domain of our perturbation theory .
