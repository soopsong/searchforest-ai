this paper addresses the problem of qubit routing in first - generation and other near - term quantum computers . in particular , it is asserted that the qubit routing problem can be formulated as a reinforcement learning ( rl ) problem , and that this is sufficient , in principle , to discover the optimal qubit routing policy for any given quantum computer architecture . in order to achieve this , it is necessary to alter the conventional rl framework to allow combinatorial action space , and this represents a second contribution of this paper , which is expected to find additional application , beyond the qubit routing problem addressed herein . numerical results are included demonstrating the advantage of the rl - trained qubit routing policy over using a sorting network .
