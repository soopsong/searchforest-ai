we introduce a class of communication tests where the task is to communicate partial ignorance by means of a physical system . we present a full characterization of the implementations of these tests in the qubit case and partial results for qudits . a peculiar observation is that two physical systems with the same operational dimensions may differ with respect to implementations of these tasks , as is shown to be the case for the qubit and rebit . finally , we consider the natural question whether some of the communication tests are more difficult than others . a new preordering that we call the ultraweak matrix majorization is presented to answer this question in a theory - independent way .
