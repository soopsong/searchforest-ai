we theoretically study the transparency and amplification of a weak probe field applied to the cavity in hy- brid systems formed by a driven superconducting circuit qed system and a mechanical resonator , or a driven optomechanical system and a superconducting qubit . we find that both the mechanical resonator and the su- perconducting qubit can result in the transparency to a weak probe field in such hybrid systems when a strong driving field is applied to the cavity . we also find that the weak probe field can be amplified in some parameter regimes . we further study the statistical properties of the output field via the degrees of second - order coherence . we find that the nonclassicality of the output field strongly depends on the system parameters . our studies show that one can control single - photon transmission in the optomechanical system via a tunable artificial atom or in the circuit qed system via a mechanical resonator .
