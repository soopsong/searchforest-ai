we initiate the study of passive environment - assisted communication via a quantum channel , modeled as a unitary interaction between the information carrying system and an environment . in this model , the environment is controlled by a benevolent helper who can set its initial state such as to assist sender and receiver of the communication link . ( the case of a malicious environment , also known as jammer , or arbitrarily varying channel , is essentially well - understood and comprehensively reviewed . ) here , after setting out precise definitions , focussing on the problem of quantum communication , we show that entanglement plays a crucial role in this problem : indeed , the assisted capacity where the helper is restricted to product states between channel uses is different from the one with unrestricted helper . furthermore , prior shared entanglement between the helper and the receiver makes a difference , too .
