we prove that a harmonic oscillator driven by lindblad dynamics where the typical drive and loss channels are two - photon processes instead of single - photon ones , converges to a protected subspace spanned by two coherent states of opposite amplitude . we then characterize the slow dynamics induced by a perturbative single - photon loss on this protected subspace , by performing adiabatic elimination in the lindbladian dynamics .
