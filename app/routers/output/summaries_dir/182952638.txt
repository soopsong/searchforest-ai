it is well known that symplectic methods have been rigorously shown to be superior to non - symplectic ones especially in long - time computation , when applied to deterministic hamiltonian systems . in this paper , we focus on the superiority of stochastic symplectic methods applied to a linear stochastic oscillator , from the perspective of large deviations principle ( ldp ) . based on the g\"artner -- ellis theorem , we first study the ldps of the mean position and the mean velocity for both the exact solution of the stochastic oscillator and its numerical approximations . then , by giving the conditions which make numerical methods have first order convergence in mean - square sense , we prove that symplectic methods asymptotically preserve these two ldps , in the sense that the modified rate functions of symplectic methods converge to the rate functions of exact solution . this indicates that stochastic symplectic methods are able to approximate well the exponential decay speed of the"hitting probability"of the mean position and mean velocity of the original system . however , it is shown that non - symplectic methods do not asymptotically preserve these two ldps by using the tail estimation of gaussian random variables . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first result about using ldp to show the superiority of stochastic symplectic methods compared with non - symplectic ones .
