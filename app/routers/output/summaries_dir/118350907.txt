we introduce a new non - gaussian state , generated by m times coherent superposition operation $ a\cos \theta + a^{\dagger } e^{i\varphi } \sin \theta $ ( mcso ) on odd - schrodinger - cat state ( oscs ) . its normalized constant is turned out to be related with the hermite polynomial . we further investigate the nonclassical properties of the mcso - oscs through mandel 's q - parameter , quadrature squeezing , the photocount distribution and wigner function ( wf ) . it is shown that the nonclassicality of the mcso - oscs is influenced by the number of times ( m ) of coherent superpositon operation , the angle $ \theta $ and the amplitude of the coherent state ( |$\alpha _ { 0}$| ) . especially the volume of negative region of wf increases with the increment of parameters m , $ \theta $ and $ \alpha _ { 0}$. we also investigate the decoherence of the mcso - oscs in terms of the fadeaway of the negativity of wf in a thermal environment .
