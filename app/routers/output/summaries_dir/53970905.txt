we present a quantum algorithm for approximating the real time evolution $ e^{-iht}$ of an arbitrary $ d$-sparse hamiltonian to error $ \epsilon$ , given black - box access to the positions and $ b$-bit values of its non - zero matrix entries . the complexity of our algorithm is $ \mathcal{o}((t\sqrt{d}\|h\|_{1 \rightarrow 2})^{1+o(1)}/\epsilon^{o(1)})$ queries and a factor $ \mathcal{o}(b)$ more gates , which is shown to be optimal up to subpolynomial factors through a matching query lower bound . this provides a polynomial speedup in sparsity for the common case where the spectral norm $ \|h\|\ge\|h\|_{1 \rightarrow 2}$ is known , and generalizes previous approaches which achieve optimal scaling , but with respect to more restrictive parameters . by exploiting knowledge of the spectral norm , our algorithm solves the black - box unitary implementation problem -- $ \mathcal{o}(d^{1/2+o(1)})$ queries suffice to approximate any $ d$-sparse unitary in the black - box setting , which matches the quantum search lower bound of $ \omega(\sqrt{d})$ queries and improves upon prior art [ berry and childs , qip 2010 ] of $ \tilde{\mathcal{o}}(d^{2/3})$ queries . combined with known techniques , we also solve systems of sparse linear equations with condition number $ \kappa$ using $ \mathcal{o}((\kappa \sqrt{d})^{1+o(1)}/\epsilon^{o(1)})$ queries , which is a quadratic improvement in sparsity .
