quantum nanophotonics has become a new research frontier where quantum optics is combined with nanophotonics in order to enhance and control the interaction between strongly confined light and quantum emitters . such progress provides a promising pathway towards quantum - information processing on an all - solid - state platform . here we review recent progress on experiments with single quantum dots in nanophotonic structures . embedding the quantum dots in photonic band - gap structures offers a way of controlling spontaneous emission of single photons to a degree that is determined by the local light - matter coupling strength . introducing defects in photonic crystals implies new functionalities . for instance , efficient and strongly confined cavities can be constructed enabling cavity - quantum - electrodynamics experiments . furthermore , the speed of light can be tailored in a photonic - crystal waveguide forming the basis for highly efficient single - photon sources where the photons are channeled into the slowly propagating mode of the waveguide . finally , we will discuss some of the surprises that arise in solid - state implementations of quantum - optics experiments in comparison to their atomic counterparts . in particular , it will be shown that the celebrated point - dipole description of light - matter interaction can break down when quantum dots are coupled to plasmon nanostructures .
