in open quantum systems , entanglement can vanish faster than coherence . this phenomenon is usually called sudden death of entanglement . in this paper sudden death of entanglement is discussed from a geometrical point of view , in the context of two qubits . a classification of possible scenarios is presented , with important known examples classified . theoretical and experimental construction of other examples is suggested as well as large dimensional and multipartite versions of the effect .
