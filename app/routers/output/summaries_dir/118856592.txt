the certificate of success for a number of important quantum information processing protocols , such as entanglement distillation , is based on the difference in the entanglement content of the quantum states before and after the protocol . in such cases , effective bounds need to be placed on the entanglement of non - local states consistent with statistics obtained from local measurements . in this work , we study numerically the ability of a novel type of homodyne detector which combines phase sensitivity and photon - number resolution to set accurate bounds on the entanglement content of two - mode quadrature squeezed states without the need for full state tomography . we show that it is possible to set tight lower bounds on the entanglement of a family of two - mode degaussified states using only a few measurements . this presents a significant improvement over the resource requirements for the experimental demonstration of continuous - variable entanglement distillation , which traditionally relies on full quantum state tomography .
