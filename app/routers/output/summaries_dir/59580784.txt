reliable single photon sources constitute the basis of schemes for quantum communication and measurement based quantum computing . solid state single photon sources based on quantum dots are convenient and versatile but the electronic transitions that generate the photons are subject to interactions with lattice vibrations . using a microscopic model of electron - phonon interactions and a quantum master equation , we here examine phonon - induced decoherence and assess its impact on the rate of production , and indistinguishability , of single photons emitted from an optically driven quantum dot system . we find that , above a certain threshold of desired indistinguishability , it is possible to mitigate the deleterious effects of phonons by exploiting a three - level raman process for photon production .
