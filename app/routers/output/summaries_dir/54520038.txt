we investigate the entanglement entropy of a two - dimensional disordered system holographically . the disorder deforms a two - dimensional conformal field theory defined at a uv fixed point to a lifshitz field theory in an ir region . after decomposing the entanglement entropy into short and long range correlations , we investigate how the entanglement entropy of the disordered system evolves from uv to ir along the renormalization group flow . the long range correlation interestingly leads to a universal critical exponent in the ir regime , which is only very weakly dependent on the strength of the disorder . we also investigate a possible phase transition and long range correlation between two subsystems by studying the mutual information .
