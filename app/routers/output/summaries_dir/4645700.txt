we describe and demonstrate a method to control a detuned movable - mirror fabry - perot cavity using radiation pressure in the presence of a strong optical spring . at frequencies below the optical spring resonance , self - locking of the cavity is achieved intrinsically by the optomechanical ( om ) interaction between the cavity field and the movable end mirror . the om interaction results in a high rigidity and reduced susceptibility of the mirror to external forces . however , due to a finite delay time in the cavity , this enhanced rigidity is accompanied by an anti - damping force , which destabilizes the cavity . the cavity is stabilized by applying external feedback in a frequency band around the optical spring resonance . the error signal is sensed in the amplitude quadrature of the transmitted beam with a photodetector . an amplitude modulator in the input path to the cavity modulates the light intensity to provide the stabilizing radiation pressure force .
