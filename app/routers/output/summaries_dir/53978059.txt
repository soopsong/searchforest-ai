we define and analyze random quantum walks on homogeneous trees of degree $ q\geq 3$. such walks describe the discrete time evolution of a quantum particle with internal degree of freedom in $ \c^q$ hopping on the neighboring sites of the tree in presence of static disorder . the one time step random unitary evolution operator of the particle depends on a unitary matrix $ c\in u(q)$ which monitors the strength of the disorder . we prove for any $ q$ that there exist open sets of matrices in $ u(q)$ for which the random evolution has either pure point spectrum almost surely or purely absolutely continuous spectrum , thereby showing the existence of a spectral transition driven by $ c\in u(q)$. for $ q\in\{3,4\}$ , we establish properties of the spectral diagram which provide a description of the spectral transition .
