consider many instances of an arbitrary quadripartite pure state of four quantum systems acbr . alice holds the ac part of each state , bob holds b , while r represents all other parties correlated with acb . alice is required to redistribute the c systems to bob while asymptotically retaining the purity of the global states . we prove that this is possible using q qubits of communication and e ebits of shared entanglement between alice and bob provided that q < i(r;c|b)/2 and q + e < h(c|b ) . this matches the outer bound for this problem given in quant - ph/0611008 . the optimal qubit rate provides the first known operational interpretation of quantum conditional mutual information . we also show how our protocol leads to a fully operational proof of strong subaddivity and uncover a general organizing principle , in analogy to thermodynamics , which underlies the optimal rates .
