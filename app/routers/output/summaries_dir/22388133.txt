we model the spectral quantum - mechanical purity of heralded single photons from a photon - pair source based on nondegenerate spontaneous four - wave mixing taking the impact of distributed dispersion fluctuations into account . the considered photon - pair - generation scheme utilizes pump - pulse walk - off to produce pure heralded photons and phase matching is achieved through the dispersion properties of distinct spatial modes in a few - mode silica step - index fiber . we show that fiber - core - radius fluctuations in general severely impact the single - photon purity . furthermore , by optimizing the fiber design we show that generation of single photons with very high spectral purity is feasible even in the presence of large core - radius fluctuations . at the same time , contamination from spontaneous raman scattering is greatly mitigated by separating the single - photon frequency by more than 32 thz from the pump frequency .
