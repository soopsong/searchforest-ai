computational advantages gained by quantum algorithms rely largely on the coherence of quantum devices and are generally compromised by decoherence . as an exception , we present a quantum algorithm for graph isomorphism testing whose performance is optimal when operating in the partially coherent regime , as opposed to the extremes of fully coherent or classical regimes . the algorithm builds on continuous - time quantum stochastic walks ( qsws ) on graphs and the algorithmic performance is quantified by the distinguishing power ( dip ) between non - isomorphic graphs . the qsw explores the entire graph and acquires information about the underlying structure , which is extracted by monitoring stochastic jumps across an auxiliary edge . the resulting counting statistics of stochastic jumps is used to identify the spectrum of the dynamical generator of the qsw , serving as a novel graph invariant , based on which non - isomorphic graphs are distinguished . we provide specific examples of non - isomorphic graphs that are only distinguishable by qsws in the presence of decoherence .
