this paper considers a problem of quantum communication between parties that are connected through a network of quantum channels . the model in this paper assumes that there is no prior entanglement shared among any of the parties , but that classical communication is free . the task is to perfectly transfer an unknown quantum state from a source subsystem to a target subsystem , where both source and target are formed by ordered sets of some of the nodes . it is proved that a lower bound of the rate at which this quantum communication task is possible is given by the classical min - cut max - flow theorem of network coding , where the capacities in question are the quantum capacities of the edges of the network .
