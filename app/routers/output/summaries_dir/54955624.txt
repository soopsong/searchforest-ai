we propose to couple a trapped single electron to superconducting structures located at a variable distance from the electron . the electron is captured in a cryogenic penning trap using electric fields and a static magnetic field in the tesla range . measurements on the electron will allow investigating the properties of the superconductor such as vortex structure , damping and decoherence . we propose to couple a superconducting microwave resonator to the electron in order to realize a circuit qed - like experiment , as well as to couple superconducting josephson junctions or superconducting quantum interferometers ( squids ) to the electron . the electron may also be coupled to a vortex which is situated in a double well potential , realized by nearby pinning centers in the superconductor , acting as a quantum mechanical two level system that can be controlled by a transport current tilting the double well potential . when the vortex is trapped in the interferometer arms of a squid , this would allow its detection both by the squid and by the electron .
