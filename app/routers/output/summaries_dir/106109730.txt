we review the main arguments against antigravity , a different acceleration of antimatter relative to matter in a gravitational field , discussing and challenging morrison 's , good 's and schiff 's arguments . following price , we show that , very surprisingly , the usual expression of the equivalence principle is violated by general relativity when particles of negative mass are supposed to exist , which may provide a fundamental explanation of mond phenomenology , obviating the need for dark matter . motivated by the observation of repulsive gravity under the form of dark energy , and by the fact that our universe looks very similar to a coasting ( neither decelerating nor accelerating ) universe , we study the dirac - milne cosmology , a symmetric matter - antimatter cosmology where antiparticles have the same gravitational properties as holes in a semiconductor . noting the similarities with our universe ( age , sn1a luminosity distance , nucleosynthesis , cmb angular scale ) , we focus our attention on structure formation mechanisms , finding strong similarities with our universe . additional tests of the dirac - milne cosmology are briefly reviewed , and we finally note that a crucial test of the dirac - milne cosmology will be soon realized at cern next to the elena antiproton decelerator , possibly as early as fall 2018 , with the aegis , alpha - g and gbar antihydrogen gravity experiments .
