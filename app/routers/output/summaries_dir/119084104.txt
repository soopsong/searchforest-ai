we investigate entanglement of purification in conformal field theory . by using reeh - schlieder theorem , we construct a set of the purification states for $ \rho_{ab}$ , where $ \rho_{ab}$ is reduced density matrix for subregion $ ab$ of a global state $ \rho$. the set can be approximated by acting all the unitary observables , located in the complement of subregion $ ab$ , on the global state $ \rho$ , as long as the global state $ \rho$ is \text{cyclic } for every local algebra , e.g. , the vacuum state . combining with the gravity explanation of unitary operations in the context of the so - called surface / state correspondence , we prove the holographic eop formula . we also explore the projective measurement with the conformal basis in conformal field theory and its relation to the minimization procedure of eop . interestingly , though the projective measurement is not a unitary operator , the difference in some limits between holographic eop and the entanglement entropy after a suitable projective measurement is a constant $ \frac{c}{3}\log 2 $ up to some contributions from boundary . this suggests the states after projective measurements may approximately be taken as the purification state corresponding to the minimal value of the procedure .
