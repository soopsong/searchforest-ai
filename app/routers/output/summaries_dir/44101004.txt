we propose an approach to use the state covariance of linear systems to track time - varying covariance matrices of non - stationary time series . following concepts from riemmanian geometry , we investigate three types of covariance paths obtained by using different quadratic regularizations of system matrices . the first quadratic form induces the geodesics based on the bures - wasserstein metric from optimal mass transport theory and quantum mechanics . the second type of quadratic form leads to the geodesics based on the fisher - rao metric from information geometry . in the process , we introduce a fluid - mechanics interpretation of the fisher - rao metric for multivariate gaussian distributions . a main contribution of this work is the introduction of the third type of covariance paths which are steered by linear system matrices with rotating eigenspace . we provide theoretical results on the existence and uniqueness of this type of covariance paths . the three types of covariance paths are compared using two examples with synthetic data and real data based on functional magnetic resonance imaging , respectively .
