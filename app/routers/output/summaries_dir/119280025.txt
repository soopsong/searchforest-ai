we study the implementation of quantum channels with quantum computers while minimizing the experimental cost , measured in terms of the number of controlled - not ( c - not ) gates required ( single - qubit gates are free ) . we consider three different models . in the first , the quantum circuit model ( qcm ) , we consider sequences of single - qubit and c - not gates and allow qubits to be traced out at the end of the gate sequence . in the second ( randomqcm ) , we also allow external classical randomness . in the third ( measuredqcm ) we also allow measurements followed by operations that are classically controlled on the outcomes . we prove lower bounds on the number of c - not gates required and give near - optimal decompositions in almost all cases . our main result is a measuredqcm circuit for any channel from m qubits to n qubits that uses at most one ancilla and has a low c - not count . we give explicit examples for small numbers of qubits that provide the lowest known c - not counts .
