we demonstrate low - power amplification process in cavity optomechanics ( com ) . this operation is based on the nonlinear position - modulated self - kerr interaction . owing to this nonlinear term , the effective coupling highly scales with the photon number , resulting in a giant enhancement of the cooperativity . even for small nonlinearity , the system reaches the amplification threshold for weak driving strength , leading to low - power phonon lasing . this amplifier can be phase - preserving and provides a practical advantage related to the power consumption issues . this work opens up new avenues to realize low - power and efficient amplifiers in optomechanics and related fields .
