this paper considers hamiltonian identification for a controllable quantum system with non - degenerate transitions and a known initial state . we assume to have at our disposal a single scalar control input and the population measure of only one state at an ( arbitrarily large ) final time t. we prove that the quantum dipole moment matrix is locally observable in the following sense : for any two close but distinct dipole moment matrices , we construct discriminating controls giving two different measurements . such discriminating controls are constructed to have three well defined temporal components , as inspired by ramsey interferometry . this result suggests that what may appear at first to be very restrictive measurements are actually rich for identification , when combined with well designed discriminating controls , to uniquely identify the complete dipole moment of such systems . the assessment supports the employment of quantum control as a promising means to achieve high quality identification of a hamiltonian .
