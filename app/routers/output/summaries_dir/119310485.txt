by starting from the stochastic schr\"odinger equation and quantum trajectory theory , we introduce memory effects by considering stochastic adapted coefficients . as an example of a natural non - markovian extension of the theory of white noise quantum trajectories we use an ornstein - uhlenbeck coloured noise as the output driving process . under certain conditions a random hamiltonian evolution is recovered . moreover , we show that our non - markovian stochastic schr\"odinger equations unravel some master equations with memory kernels .
