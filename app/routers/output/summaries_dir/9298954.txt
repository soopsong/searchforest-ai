a bell inequality defined for a specific experimental configuration can always be extended to a situation involving more observers , measurement settings or measurement outcomes . in this article , such"liftings"of bell inequalities are studied . it is shown that if the original inequality defines a facet of the polytope of local joint outcome probabilities then the lifted one also defines a facet of the more complex polytope .
