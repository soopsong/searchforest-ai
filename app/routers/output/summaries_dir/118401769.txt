the necessity of quantising the gravitational field is still subject to an open debate . in this paper we compare the approach of quantum gravity , with that of a fundamentally semi - classical theory of gravity , in the weak - field non - relativistic limit . we show that , while in the former case the schr\"odinger equation stays linear , in the latter case one ends up with the so - called schr\"odinger - newton equation , which involves a nonlinear , non - local gravitational contribution . we further discuss that the schr\"odinger - newton equation does not describe the collapse of the wave - function , although it was initially proposed for exactly this purpose . together with the standard collapse postulate , fundamentally semi - classical gravity gives rise to superluminal signalling . a consistent fundamentally semi - classical theory of gravity can therefore only be achieved together with a suitable prescription of the wave - function collapse . we further discuss , how collapse models avoid such superluminal signalling and compare the nonlinearities appearing in these models with those in the schr\"odinger - newton equation .
