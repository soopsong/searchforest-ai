implementing spatially - encoded universal linear multiport interferometers on integrated photonic platforms with high controllability becomes increasingly difficult as the number of modes increases . in this work , we consider an architecture in which temporally - encoded modes are injected into a chain of reconfigurable beamsplitters and delay loops , and provide a detailed loss analysis for this and other comparable architectures . this analysis also yields a straightforward and explicit description of the control sequence needed for implementing an arbitrary temporally - encoded transformation . we consider possible physical implementations of these architectures and compare their performance . we conclude that implementing a chain of reconfigurable beamsplitters and delay loops on an integrated lithum niobate platform could outperform comparable architectures in the near future .
