we discuss the possibility of existence of entanglement in biological systems . our arguments centre on the fact that biological systems are thermodynamic open driven systems far from equilibrium . in such systems error correction can occur which may maintain entanglement despite high levels of de - coherence . we also discuss the possibility of cooling ( classical or quantum ) at molecular level .
