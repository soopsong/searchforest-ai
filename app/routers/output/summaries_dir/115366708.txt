implication logic gates that are based on volatile memristors are demonstrated experimentally with the use of relay - based volatile memristor emulators of an original design . the fabricated logic circuit involves two volatile memristors and it is capable of performing four fundamental logic functions ( two types of material implication and the negations thereof ) . moreover , current - voltage characteristics of individual emulators are recorded and self - sustained oscillations in a resistor - volatile memristor circuit are found . the developed emulator offers a great potential for memristive circuit experiments because of its simplicity , similarity of response with volatile memristors , and low cost . our findings , which are based on emulators , can easily be reproduced with physical volatile memristors and , thus , open up possibilities for emerging in - memory computing architectures .
