in this paper we consider the problem of unambiguous discrimination between a set of linearly independent pure quantum states . we show that the design of the optimal measurement that minimizes the probability of an inconclusive result can be formulated as a semidefinite programming problem . based on this formulation , we develop a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for an optimal quantum measurement . we show that the optimal measurement can be computed very efficiently in polynomial time by exploiting the many well - known algorithms for solving semidefinite programs , which are guaranteed to converge to the global optimum . using the general conditions for optimality , we derive necessary and sufficient conditions so that the measurement that results in an equal probability of an inconclusive result for each one of the quantum states is optimal . we refer to this measurement as the equal - probability measurement ( epm ) . we then show that for any state set , the prior probabilities of the states can be chosen such that the epm is optimal . finally , we consider state sets with strong symmetry properties and equal prior probabilities for which the epm is optimal . we first consider geometrically uniform state sets that are defined over a group of unitary matrices and are generated by a single generating vector . we then consider compound geometrically uniform state sets which are generated by a group of unitary matrices using multiple generating vectors , where the generating vectors satisfy a certain ( weighted ) norm constraint .
