we define and study a fidelity criterion for quantum channels , which we term the minimax fidelity , through a noncommutative generalization of maximal hellinger distance between two positive kernels in classical probability theory . like other known fidelities for quantum channels , the minimax fidelity is well - defined for channels between finite - dimensional algebras , but it also applies to a certain class of channels between infinite - dimensional algebras ( explicitly , those channels that possess an operator - valued radon -- nikodym density with respect to the trace in the sense of belavkin -- staszewski ) and induces a metric on the set of quantum channels which is topologically equivalent to the cb - norm distance between channels , precisely in the same way as the bures metric on the density operators associated with statistical states of quantum - mechanical systems , derived from the well - known fidelity ( ` generalized transition probability ' ) of uhlmann , is topologically equivalent to the trace - norm distance .
