we study the quantum query complexity of constant - sized subgraph containment . such problems include determining whether an $ n $ -vertex graph contains a triangle , clique or star of some size . for a general subgraph $ h $ with $ k $ vertices , we show that $ h $ containment can be solved with quantum query complexity $ o(n^{2-\frac{2}{k}-g(h ) } ) $ , with $ g(h ) $ a strictly positive function of $ h $ . this is better than $ \tilde{o}\s{n^{2 - 2 / k } } $ by magniez et al . these results are obtained in the learning graph model of belovs .
