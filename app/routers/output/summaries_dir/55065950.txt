the reeh - schlieder theorem , with the time - slice axiom of quantum field theory , may be used to recover the information which falls into a black hole . analyticity of quantum fields in states with finite energy plays the crucial role . in ads spacetime , our argument based on the reeh - schlieder theorem is consistent with the argument that there is no information loss because of the ads / cft correspondence .
