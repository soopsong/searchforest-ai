a succinct summary is given of the problem of reconciling observation of black hole - like objects with quantum mechanics . if quantum black holes behave like subsystems , and also decay , their information must be transferred to their environments . interactions that accomplish this with ` minimal ' departure from a standard description are parameterized . possible sensitivity of gravitational wave or very long baseline interferometric observations to these interactions is briefly outlined .
