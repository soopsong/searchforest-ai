a one dimensional optical lattice is considered where a second dimension is encoded in the internal states of the atoms giving effective ladder systems . frustration is introduced by an additional optical lattice that induces tunneling of superposed atomic states . the effects of frustration range from the stabilization of the mott insulator phase with ferromagnetic order , to the breakdown of superfluidity and the formation of a macroscopically fragmented phase .
