dark state as a consequence of interference between different quantum states has great importance in the fields of chip - scale atomic clock and quantum information . for the $ \lambda$-type three - level system , this dark state is generally regarded as being dissipation - free because it is a superposition of two lowest states without dipole transition between them . however , previous studies are based on the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) by neglecting the counter - rotating terms in the system - environment interaction . in this work , we study non - markovian quantum dynamics of the dark state in a $ \lambda$-type three - level system coupled to two bosonic baths and reveal the effect of counter - rotating terms on the dark state . in contrast to the dark state within the rwa , leakage of the dark state occurs even at zero temperature , as a result of these counter - rotating terms . also , we present a method to restore the quantum coherence of the dark state by applying a leakage elimination operator to the system .
