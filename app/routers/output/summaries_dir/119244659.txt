in this work we study the entanglement entropy of a uniform quantum ising chain in transverse field undergoing a periodic driving of period $ \tau$ . by means of floquet theory we show that , for any subchain , the entanglement entropy tends asymptotically to a value $ \tau$ - periodic in time . we provide a semi - analytical formula for the leading term of this asymptotic regime : it is constant in time and obeys a volume law . the entropy in the asymptotic regime is always smaller than the thermal one : because of integrability the system locally relaxes to a generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) density matrix . the leading term of the asymptotic entanglement entropy is completely determined by this gge density matrix . remarkably , the asymptotic entropy shows marked features in correspondence to some non - equilibrium quantum phase transitions undergone by a floquet state analog of the ground state .
