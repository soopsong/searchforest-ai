we investigate signatures of non - classicality in quantum states , in particular , those involved in the dqc1 model of mixed - state quantum computation [ phys . rev . lett . 81 , 5672 ( 1998 ) ] . to do so , we consider two known non - classicality criteria . the first quantifies disturbance of a quantum state under locally noneffective unitary operations ( lnu ) , which are local unitaries acting invariantly on a subsystem . the second quantifies measurement induced disturbance ( mid ) in the eigenbasis of the reduced density matrices . we study the role of both figures of non - classicality in the exponential speedup of the dqc1 model and compare them vis - a - vis the interpretation provided in terms of quantum discord . in particular , we prove that a non - zero quantum discord implies a non - zero shift under lnus . we also use the mid measure to study the locking of classical correlations [ phys . rev . lett . 92 , 067902 ( 2004 ) ] using two mutually unbiased bases ( mub ) . we find the mid measure to exactly correspond to the number of locked bits of correlation . for three or more mubs , it predicts the possibility of superior locking effects .
