the quantum approximate optimization algorithm ( qaoa ) is a standard method for combinatorial optimization with a gate - based quantum computer . the qaoa consists of a particular ansatz for the quantum circuit architecture , together with a prescription for choosing the variational parameters of the circuit . we propose modifications to both . first , we define the gibbs objective function and show that it is superior to the energy expectation value for use as an objective function in tuning the variational parameters . second , we describe an ansatz architecture search ( aas ) algorithm for searching the discrete space of quantum circuit architectures near the qaoa to find a better ansatz . through the aas we find quantum circuits with the same number of variational parameters as the qaoa but which have improved performance on certain ising - type problems . this opens a new research field of quantum circuit architecture design for quantum optimization algorithms .
