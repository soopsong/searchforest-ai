a system consisting of two single - mode cavities spatially separated and connected by an optical fiber and multiple two - level atoms trapped in the cavities is considered . if the atoms resonantly and collectively interact with the local cavity fields but there is no direct interaction between the atoms , we show that an ideal quantum state transfer and highly reliable quantum swap , entangling , and controlled - z gates can be deterministically realized between the distant cavities . we find that the operation of state transfer and swap , entangling , and controlled - z gates can be greatly speeded up as number of the atoms in the cavities increases . we also notice that the effects of spontaneous emission of atoms and photon leakage out of cavity on the quantum processes can also be greatly diminished in the multiatom case .
