the purport of quantum teleportation is to completely transfer information from one party to another distant partner . however , from the perspective of parameter estimation , it is the information carried by a particular parameter , not the information of total quantum state that needs to be teleported . due to the inevitable noise in environment , we propose two schemes to enhance quantum fisher information ( qfi ) teleportation under amplitude damping noise with the technique of partial measurements . we find that post partial measurement can greatly enhance the teleported qfi , while the combination of prior partial measurement and post partial measurement reversal could completely eliminate the effect of decoherence . we show that , somewhat consequentially , enhancing qfi teleportation is more economic than that of improving fidelity teleportation . our work extends the ability of partial measurements as a quantum technique to battle decoherence in quantum information processing .
