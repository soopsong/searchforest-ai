we propose replacing concurrence by convex - roof extended negativity ( cren ) for studying monogamy of entanglement ( moe ) . we show that all proven moe relations using concurrence can be rephrased in terms of cren . furthermore we show that higher - dimensional ( qudit ) extensions of moe in terms of cren are not disproven by any of the counterexamples used to disprove qudit extensions of moe in terms of concurrence . we further test the cren version of moe for qudits by considering fully or partially coherent mixtures of a qudit w - class state with the vacuum and show that the cren version of moe for qudits is satisfied in this case as well . the cren version of moe for qudits is thus a strong conjecture with no obvious counterexamples .
