a fundamental connection between thermodynamics and information theory arises from the fact that correlations exhibit an inherent work value . for noninteracting systems this translates to a work cost for establishing correlations . here we investigate the relationship between work and correlations in the presence of interactions that can not be controlled or removed . for such naturally coupled systems , which are correlated even in thermal equilibrium , we determine general strategies that can reduce the work cost of correlations , and illustrate these for a selection of exemplary physical systems .
