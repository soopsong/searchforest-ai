exploiting a fluid dynamic formulation for which a probabilistic counterpart might not be available , we extend the theory of schroedinger bridges to the case of inertial particles with losses and general , possibly singular diffusion coefficient . we find that , as for the case of constant diffusion coefficient matrix , the optimal control law is obtained by solving a system of two p.d.e . 's involving adjoint operators and coupled through their boundary values . in the linear case with quadratic loss function , the system turns into two matrix riccati equations with coupled split boundary conditions . an alternative formulation of the control problem as a semidefinite programming problem allows computation of suboptimal solutions . this is illustrated in one example of inertial particles subject to a constant rate killing .
