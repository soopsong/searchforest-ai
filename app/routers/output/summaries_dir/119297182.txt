environmental noise usually hinders the efficiency of charge transport through coherent quantum systems ; an exception is dephasing - assisted transport ( dat ) . we show that linear triple quantum dots in a transport configuration and subjected to pure dephasing exhibit dat if the coupling to the drain reservoir exceeds a threshold . dat occurs for arbitrarily weak dephasing and the enhancement can be directly controlled by the coupling to the drain . moreover , for specific settings , the enhanced current is accompanied by a reduction in relative shot noise . we identify the quantum zeno effect and long - distance tunnelling as underlying dynamical processes involved in dephasing - assisted and -suppressed transport . our analytical results are obtained by using the density matrix formalism and the characteristic polynomial approach to full counting statistics .
