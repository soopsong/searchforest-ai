we study scattering quantum walks on highly symmetric graphs and use the walks to solve search problems on these graphs . the particle making the walk resides on the edges of the graph , and at each time step scatters at the vertices . all of the vertices have the same scattering properties except for a subset of special vertices . the object of the search is to find a special vertex . a quantum circuit implementation of these walks is presented in which the set of special vertices is specified by a quantum oracle . we consider the complete graph , a complete bipartite graph , and an $ m$-partite graph . in all cases , the dimension of the hilbert space in which the time evolution of the walk takes place is small ( between three and six ) , so the walks can be completely analyzed analytically . such dimensional reduction is due to the fact that these graphs have large automorphism groups . we find the usual quadratic quantum speedups in all cases considered .
