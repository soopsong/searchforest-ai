we explore theoretically the feasibility of using frequency conversion by sum- or difference - frequency generation , enabled by three- wave - mixing , for selectively multiplexing orthogonal input waveforms that overlap in time and frequency . such a process would enable a drop device for use in a transparent optical network using temporally orthogonal waveforms to encode different channels . we model the process using coupled - mode equations appropriate for wave mixing in a uniform second- order nonlinear optical medium pumped by a strong laser pulse . we find green functions describing the process , and employ schmidt ( singular- value ) decompositions thereof to quantify its viability in functioning as a coherent waveform discriminator . we define a selectivity figure of merit in terms of the schmidt coefficients , and use it to compare and contrast various parameter regimes via extensive numerical computations . we identify the most favorable regime ( at least in the case of no pump chirp ) and derive the complete analytical solution for the same . we bound the maximum achievable selectivity in this parameter space . we show that including a frequency chirp in the pump does not improve selectivity in this optimal regime . we also find an operating regime in which high - efficiency frequency conversion without temporal - shape selectivity can be achieved while preserving the shapes of a wide class of input pulses . the results are applicable to both classical and quantum frequency conversion .
