the robust phase estimation ( rpe ) protocol was designed to be an efficient and robust way to calibrate quantum operations . the robustness of rpe refers to its ability to estimate a single parameter , usually gate amplitude , even when other parameters are poorly calibrated or when the gate experiences significant errors . here we demonstrate the robustness of rpe to errors that affect initialization , measurement , and gates . in each case , the error threshold at which rpe begins to fail matches quantitatively with theoretical bounds . we conclude that rpe is an effective and reliable tool for calibration of one - qubit rotations and that it is particularly useful for automated calibration routines and sensor tasks .
