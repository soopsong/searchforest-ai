the squashed entanglement is a fundamental entanglement measure in quantum information theory , finding application as an upper bound on the distillable secret key or distillable entanglement of a quantum state or a quantum channel . this paper simplifies proofs that the squashed entanglement is an upper bound on distillable key for finite - dimensional quantum systems and solidifies such proofs for infinite - dimensional quantum systems . more specifically , this paper establishes that the logarithm of the dimension of the key system ( call it $ \log_{2}k$ ) in an $ \varepsilon$-approximate private state is bounded from above by the squashed entanglement of that state plus a term that depends only $ \varepsilon$ and $ \log_{2}k$. importantly , the extra term does not depend on the dimension of the shield systems of the private state . the result holds for the bipartite squashed entanglement , and an extension of this result is established for two different flavors of the multipartite squashed entanglement .
