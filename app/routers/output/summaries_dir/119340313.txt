the initial entanglement shared between inertial and accelerated observers degrades due to the influence of the unruh effect . here , we show that the unruh effect can be completely eliminated by the technique of partial measurement . the lost entanglement could be entirely retrieved or even amplified , which is dependent on whether the optimal strength of reversed measurement is \emph{state - independent } or \emph{state - dependent } . our work provides a novel and unexpected method to recover the lost entanglement under unruh decoherence and exhibits the ability of partial measurement as an important technique in relativistic quantum information .
