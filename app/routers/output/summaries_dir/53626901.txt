we provide an efficient and general route for preparing non - trivial quantum states that are not adiabatically connected to unentangled product states . our approach is a variant of the ' quantum approximate optimization algorithm ' ( qaoa ) [ e. farhi et al . , arxiv:1411.4028 ] and is experimentally realizable on near - term quantum simulators of synthetic quantum systems . as proof of concept , our approach yields explicit protocols which prepare with perfect fidelities ( i ) the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state , ( ii ) a quantum critical state , and ( iii ) a topologically ordered state , all with $ p = l/2 $ iterations of the algorithm and physical runtimes $ t$ that scale linearly with the system size $ l$ , i.e. $ t \sim l$. the protocol is additionally able to prepare the ground states of antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains with very good fidelities . besides being practically useful , our results also illustrate the utility of qaoa - type circuits as variational wavefunctions for non - trivial states of matter .
