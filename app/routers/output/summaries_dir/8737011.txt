we experimentally study forced and self oscillations of an optomechanical cavity which is formed between a fiber bragg grating that serves as a static mirror and between a freely suspended metallic mechanical resonator that serves as a moving mirror . in the domain of small amplitude mechanical oscillations , we find that the optomechanical coupling is manifested as changes in the effective resonance frequency , damping rate and cubic nonlinearity of the mechanical resonator . moreover , self oscillations of the micromechanical mirror are observed above a certain optical power threshold . a comparison between the experimental results and a theoretical model that we have recently presented yields a good agreement . the comparison also indicates that the dominant optomechanical coupling mechanism is the heating of the metallic mirror due to optical absorption .
