we study the nonreciprocal transmission and the fast - slow light effects in a cavity optomechanical system , in which the cavity supports a clockwise and a counter - clockwise circulating optical modes , both the two modes are driven simultaneously by a strong pump field and a weak signal field . we find that when the intrinsic photon loss of the cavity is equal to the external coupling loss of the cavity , the system reveals a nonreciprocal transmission of the signal fields . however , when the intrinsic photon loss is much less than the external coupling loss , the nonreciprocity about the transmission properties almost disappears , and the nonreciprocity is shown in the group delay properties of the signal fields , and the system exhibits a nonreciprocal fast - slow light propagation phenomenon .
