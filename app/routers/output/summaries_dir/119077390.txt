the physics of quantum walks on graphs is formulated in hamiltonian language , both for simple quantum walks and for composite walks , where extra discrete degrees of freedom live at each node of the graph . it is shown how to map between quantum walk hamiltonians and hamiltonians for qubit systems and quantum circuits ; this is done for both a single- and multi - excitation coding , and for more general mappings . specific examples of spin chains , as well as static and dynamic systems of qubits , are mapped to quantum walks , and walks on hyperlattices and hypercubes are mapped to various gate systems . we also show how to map a quantum circuit performing the quantum fourier transform , the key element of shor 's algorithm , to a quantum walk system doing the same . the results herein are an essential preliminary to a hamiltonian formulation of quantum walks in which coupling to a dynamic quantum environment is included .
