in this work we aim at proving central limit theorems for open quantum walks on $ \mathbb{z}^d$. we study the case when there are various classes of vertices in the network . furthermore , we investigate two ways of distributing the vertex classes in the network . first we assign the classes in a regular pattern . secondly , we assign each vertex a random class with a uniform distribution . for each way of distributing vertex classes , we obtain an appropriate central limit theorem , illustrated by numerical examples . these theorems may have application in the study of complex systems in quantum biology and dissipative quantum computation .
