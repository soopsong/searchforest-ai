the goldenberg - vaidman ( gv ) protocol for quantum key distribution ( qkd ) uses orthogonal encoding states of a particle . its security arises because operations accessible to eve are insufficient to distinguish the two states encoding the secret bit . we propose a two - particle cryptographic protocol for quantum secure direct communication , wherein orthogonal states encode the secret , and security arises from restricting eve from accessing any two - particle operations . however , there is a non - trivial difference between the two cases . while the encoding states are perfectly indistinguishable in gv , they are partially distinguishable in the bi - partite case , leading to a qualitatively different kind of information - vs - disturbance trade - off and also options for eve in the two cases .
