we generalize kato 's adiabatic theorem to nonunitary dynamics with an isospectral generator . this enables us to unify two strong - coupling limits : one driven by fast oscillations under a hamiltonian , and the other driven by strong damping under a lindbladian . we discuss the case where both mechanisms are present and provide nonperturbative error bounds . we also analyze the links with the quantum zeno effect and dynamics .
