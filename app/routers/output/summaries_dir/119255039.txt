this paper considers the transmission characteristics of incidenting from an infinte coupled - resonator waveguide ( crw ) or a semi - infinite crw , respectively . the nth cavity of a semi - infinite crw intersecting with an infinite crw and a cascade three level system(ctls ) form a t - bulge structure . due to symmetry breaking boundary , the maximum of transfer rate would reach unity when light incidenting from the semi - infinite crw , while reach 0.5 for infinite crw case . the position of the intersection have effect on the location of the extreme point of the transmission coefficients changing with couple strength . 4d figures are used to illustrate the transmission characteristics , which is more visable .
