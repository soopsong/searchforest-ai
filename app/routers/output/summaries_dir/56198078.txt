we propose that a large schwarzschild black hole ( bh ) is a bound state of highly excited , long , closed strings at the hagedorn temperature . the size of the bound state is smaller than the string random - walk scale and determined dynamically by the string attractive interactions . it is further proposed that the effective free - energy density of the bound state should be expressed as a function of its entropy density . for a macroscopic bh , the free - energy density contains only linear and quadratic terms , in analogy with that of a collapsed polymer when expressed as a function of the polymer concentration . using the effective free energy , we derive scaling relations for the entropy , energy and size of the bound state and show that these agree with the scaling relations of the bh ; in particular , with the area law for the bh entropy . the area law originates from the inverse scaling of the effective temperature with the bound - state radius . we also find that the energy density of the bound state is equal to its pressure .
