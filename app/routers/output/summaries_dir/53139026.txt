recent technological developments in the field of experimental quantum annealing have made prototypical annealing optimizers with hundreds of qubits commercially available . the experimental demonstration of a quantum speedup for optimization problems has since then become a coveted , albeit elusive goal . recent studies have shown that the so far inconclusive results , regarding a quantum enhancement , may have been partly due to the benchmark problems used being unsuitable . in particular , these problems had inherently too simple a structure , allowing for both traditional resources and quantum annealers to solve them with no special efforts . the need therefore has arisen for the generation of harder benchmarks which would hopefully possess the discriminative power to separate classical scaling of performance with size , from quantum . we introduce here a practical technique for the engineering of extremely hard spin glass ising - type problem instances that does not require ` cherry picking ' from large ensembles of randomly generated instances . we accomplish this by treating the generation of hard optimization problems itself as an optimization problem , for which we offer a heuristic algorithm that solves it . we demonstrate the genuine thermal hardness of our generated instances by examining them thermodynamically and analyzing their energy landscapes , as well as by testing the performance of various state - of - the art algorithms on them . we argue that a proper characterization of the generated instances offers a practical , efficient way to properly benchmark experimental quantum annealers , as well as any other optimization algorithm .
