complex mesoscopic systems play increasingly important roles in modern science -- from understanding biological functions at the molecular level , to designing solid - state information processing devices . the operation of these systems typically depends on their energetic structure , yet probing their energy - landscape can be extremely challenging ; they have many degrees of freedom , which may be hard to isolate and measure independently . here we show that a qubit ( a two - level quantum system ) with a biased energy - splitting can directly probe the spectral properties of a complex system , without knowledge of how they couple . our work is based on the completely - positive and trace - preserving map formalism , which treats any unknown dynamics as a ` black - box ' process . this black box contains information about the system with which the probe interacts , which we access by measuring the survival probability of the initial state of the probe as function of the energy - splitting and the process time . fourier transforming the results yields the energy spectrum of the complex system . without making assumptions about the strength or form of its coupling , our probe could determine aspects of a complex molecule 's energy landscape as well as , in many cases , test for coherent superposition of its energy eigenstates .
