identifying and ameliorating dominant sources of decoherence are important steps in understanding and improving quantum systems . here we show that the free induction decay time ( $ t_{2}^{*}$ ) and the rabi decay rate ( $ \gamma_{\mathrm{rabi}}$ ) of the quantum dot hybrid qubit can be increased by more than an order of magnitude by appropriate tuning of the qubit parameters and operating points . by operating in the spin - like regime of this qubit , and choosing parameters that increase the qubit 's resilience to charge noise ( which we show is presently the limiting noise source for this qubit ) , we achieve a ramsey decay time $ t_{2}^{*}$ of $ 177~\mathrm{ns}$ and a rabi decay time , $ 1/\gamma_{\mathrm{rabi}}$ , exceeding $ 1~\mathrm{\mu s}$. we find that the slowest $ \gamma_{\mathrm{rabi}}$ is limited by fluctuations in the rabi frequency induced by charge noise and not by fluctuations in the qubit energy itself .
