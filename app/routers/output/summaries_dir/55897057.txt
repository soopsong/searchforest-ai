we construct entanglement witnesses using fundamental quantum operators of spin models which contain two - particle interactions and posses a certain symmetry . by choosing the hamiltonian as such an operator , our method can be used for detecting entanglement by energy measurement . we apply this method to the cubic heisenberg lattice model in a magnetic field , the xy model and other familiar spin systems . our method is used to obtain a temperature bound for separable states for systems in thermal equilibrium . we also study the bose - hubbard model and relate its energy minimum for separable states to the minimum obtained from the gutzwiller ansatz .
