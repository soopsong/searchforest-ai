we report the realization of a new iterative fourier - transform algorithm for creating holograms that can diffract light into an arbitrary two - dimensional intensity profile . we show that the predicted intensity distributions are smooth with a fractional error from the target distribution at the percent level . we demonstrate that this new algorithm outperforms the most frequently used alternatives typically by one and two orders of magnitude in accuracy and roughness , respectively . the techniques described in this paper outline a path to creating arbitrary holographic atom traps in which the only remaining hurdle is physical implementation .
