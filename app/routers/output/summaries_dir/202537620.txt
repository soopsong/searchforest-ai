high - precision operation of quantum computing systems must be robust to uncertainties and noises in the quantum hardware . in this paper , we show that through a game played between the uncertainties ( or noises ) and the controls , adversarial uncertainty samples can be generated to train highly robust controls through the search for nash equilibria ( ne ) . we propose two effective learning schemes , namely the best - response approach and the better - response approach , to make the learning converge faster to robust controls . numerical experiments demonstrate a remarkable enhancement of control robustness while preserving high accuracy .
