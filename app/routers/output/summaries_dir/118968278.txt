a method for reconstructing joint photon - number distributions of twin beams from the experimental photocount histograms is suggested and experimentally implemented . contrary to the standard reconstruction methods , it incorporates spatial noise reduction based on spatial pairing of photons . superior performance of the method above the usual one for the maximum - likelihood approach is demonstrated .
