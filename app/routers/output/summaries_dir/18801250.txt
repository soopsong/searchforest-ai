in the one - way model of quantum computing , quantum algorithms are implemented using only measurements on an entangled initial state . much of the hard work is done up - front when creating this universal resource , known as a cluster state , on which the measurements are made . here we detail a new proposal for a scalable method of creating cluster states using only a single multimode optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) . the method generates a continuous - variable cluster state that is universal for quantum computation and encoded in the quadratures of the optical frequency comb of the opo . this work expands on the presentation in phys . rev . lett . 101 , 130501 ( 2008 ) .
