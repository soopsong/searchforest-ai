the standard hydrodynamic drude model with hard - wall boundary conditions can give accurate quantitative predictions for the optical response of noble - metal nanoparticles . however , it is less accurate for other metallic nanosystems , where surface effects due to electron density spill - out in free space can not be neglected . here we address the fundamental question whether the description of surface effects in plasmonics necessarily requires a fully quantum - mechanical approach , such as time - dependent density - functional theory ( td - dft ) , that goes beyond an effective drude - type model . we present a more general formulation of the hydrodynamic model for the inhomogeneous electron gas , which additionally includes gradients of the electron density in the energy functional . in doing so , we arrive at a self - consistent hydrodynamic model ( sc - hdm ) , where spill - out emerges naturally . we find a redshift for the optical response of na nanowires , and a blueshift for ag nanowires , which are both in quantitative agreement with experiments and more advanced quantum methods . the sc - hdm gives accurate results with modest computational effort , and can be applied to arbitrary nanoplasmonic systems of much larger sizes than accessible with td - dft methods . moreover , while the latter typically neglect retardation effects due to time - varying magnetic fields , our sc - hdm takes retardation fully into account .
