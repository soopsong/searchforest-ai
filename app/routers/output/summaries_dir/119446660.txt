we calculate in detail the renyi entanglement entropies of ctpq states as a function of subsystem volume , filling the details of our prior work [ nature communications 9 , 1635 ( 2018 ) ] , where the formulas were first presented . working in a limit of large total volume , we find universal formulas for the renyi entanglement entropies in a region where the subsystem volume is comparable to that of the total system . the formulas are applicable to the infinite temperature limit as well as general interacting systems . for example we find that the second renyi entropy of ctpq states in terms of subsystem volume is written universally up to two constants , $ s_2(\ell)=-\ln k(\beta)+\ell\ln a(\beta)-\ln\left(1+a(\beta)^{-l+2\ell}\right)$ , where $ l$ is the total volume of the system and $ a$ and $ k$ are two undetermined constants . the uses of the formulas were already presented in our prior work and we mostly concentrate on the theoretical aspect of the formulas themselves . aside from deriving the formulas for the renyi page curves , the expression for the von neumann page curve is also derived , which was not presented in our previous work .
