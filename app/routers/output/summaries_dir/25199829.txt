today 's standard fabrication processes are just capable of manufacturing slab of photonic and phononic crystals , so an efficient method for analysis of these crystals is indispensable . plane wave expansion ( pwe ) as a widely used method in studying photonic and phononic ( phoxonic ) crystals in full three dimensions is not suitable for slab analysis in its standard form , because of convergence and stability issues . here , we propose a modification to this method which overcomes these limitations . this improved method can be utilized for calculation of both photonic and phononic modes in phoxonic slabs . while in the standard three - dimensional pwe , fourier series are used to estimate the field dependence across the normal component of the slab , we expand the fields across the third dimension using eigenmodes of a plain unstructured slab . despite its approximate nature , this approach is observed to be both much faster and more accurate than the conventional pwe method and can give a very accurate estimation of confined propagating modes . as an application example of the proposed method we investigate a non - reciprocal photonic device . this device is a phoxonic slab waveguide which changes modes of optical waves by elastic waves and can be used as an optical insulator or mode converter .
