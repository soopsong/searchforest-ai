the fokker - planck equation provides complete statistical description of a particle undergoing random motion in a solvent . in the presence of lorentz force due to an external magnetic field , the fokker - planck equation picks up a tensorial coefficient , which reflects the anisotropy of the particle 's motion . this tensor , however , can not be interpreted as a diffusion tensor ; there are antisymmetric terms which give rise to fluxes perpendicular to the density gradients . here , we show that for an inhomogeneous magnetic field these nondiffusive fluxes have finite divergence and therefore affect the density evolution of the system . only in the special cases of a uniform magnetic field or carefully chosen initial condition with the same symmetry as the magnetic field can these fluxes be ignored in the density evolution .
