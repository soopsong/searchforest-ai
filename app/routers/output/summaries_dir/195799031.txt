we consider the symmetry resolved r\'enyi entropies in the one dimensional tight binding model , equivalent to the spin-1/2 xx chain in a magnetic field . we exploit the generalised fisher - hartwig conjecture to obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the entanglement entropies with a flux charge insertion at leading and subleading orders . the o(1 ) contributions are found to exhibit a rich structure of oscillatory behaviour . we then use these results to extract the symmetry resolved entanglement , determining exactly all the non - universal constants and logarithmic corrections to the scaling that are not accessible to the field theory approach . we also discuss how our results are generalised to a one - dimensional free fermi gas .
