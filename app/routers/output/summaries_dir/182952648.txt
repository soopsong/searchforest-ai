quantum supremacy is the ability of quantum processors to outperform classical computers at certain tasks . in digital random quantum circuit approaches for supremacy , the output distribution produced is described by the porter - thomas ( pt ) distribution . in this regime , the system uniformly explores its entire hilbert space , which makes simulating such quantum dynamics with classical computational resources impossible for large systems . however , the latter has no direct application so far in solving a specific problem . in this work , we show that the same sampling complexity can be achieved from driven analog quantum processors , with less stringent requirements for coherence and control . more importantly , we discuss how to apply this approach to solve problems in quantum simulations of phases of matter and machine learning . specifically , we consider a simple quantum spin chain with nearest - neighbor interactions driven by a global magnetic field . we show how quantum supremacy is achieved as a consequence of the thermalization due to the interplay between the disorder and the driven many - body dynamics . we analyze how the achieved pt distribution can be used as an accessible reference distribution to probe the many - body localization ( mbl ) phase transition . in the second part of our work , we show how our setup can be used for generative modeling machine learning tasks . we propose a novel variational hybrid quantum - classical approach , exploiting the system 's inherent tunable mbl dynamics , to train the device to learn distributions of complex classical data . the performance of our training protocol depends solely on the phase that the quantum system is in , which makes fine - tuning of local parameters not necessary . the protocol is implementable in a range of driven quantum many - body systems , compatible with noisy intermediate - scale quantum devices .
