in this work , we investigate modular hamiltonians defined with respect to arbitrary spatial regions in quantum field theory states which have semi - classical gravity duals . we find prescriptions in the gravity dual for calculating the action of the modular hamiltonian on its defining state , including its dual metric , and also on small excitations around the state . curiously , use of the covariant holographic entanglement entropy formula leads us to the conclusion that the modular hamiltonian , which in the quantum field theory acts only in the causal completion of the region , does not commute with bulk operators whose entire gauge - invariant description is space - like to the causal completion of the region .
