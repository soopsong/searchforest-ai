the proposal for quantum computing with rare - earth - ion qubits in inorganic crystals makes use of the inhomogeneous broadening of optical transitions in the ions to associate individual qubits with ions responding to radiation in selected frequency channels . we show that a class of gaussian composite pulses and complex sech pulses provide accurate qubit pi - rotations , which are at the same time channel selective on a 5 mhz frequency scale and tolerant to 0.5 mhz deviations of the transition frequency of ions within a single channel . rotations in qubit space of arbitrary angles and phases are produced by sequences of pi - pulses between the excited state of the ions and coherent superpositions of the qubit states .
