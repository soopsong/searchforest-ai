in this paper we obtain a stabilization result for the schr\"odinger equation under generic assumptions on the potential . then we consider the schr\"odinger equation with a potential which has a random time - dependent amplitude . we show that if the distribution of the amplitude is sufficiently non - degenerate , then any trajectory of system is almost surely non - bounded in sobolev spaces .
