we present a method to measure the absolute surface resistance of conductive samples at a set of ghz frequencies with superconducting lead stripline resonators at temperatures 1- 6k . the stripline structure can easily be applied for bulk samples and allows direct calculation of the surface resistance without the requirement of additional calibration measurements or sample reference points . we further describe a correction method to reduce experimental background on high - q resonance modes by exploiting tem - properties of the external cabling . we then show applications of this method to the reference materials gold , tantalum , and tin , which include the anomalous skin effect and conventional superconductivity . furthermore , we extract the complex optical conductivity for an all - lead stripline resonator to find a coherence peak and the superconducting gap of lead .
