this paper studies three kinds of long - term behaviours , namely reachability , repeated reachability and persistence , of quantum markov chains ( qmcs ) . as a stepping - stone , we introduce the notion of bottom strongly connected component ( bscc ) of a qmc and develop an algorithm for finding bscc decompositions of the state space of a qmc . as the major contribution , several ( classical ) algorithms for computing the reachability , repeated reachability and persistence probabilities of a qmc are presented , and their complexities are analysed .
