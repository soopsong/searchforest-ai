new quantum distance is introduced as a half - sum of several singular values of difference between two density operators . this is , up to factor , the metric induced by so - called ky fan norm . the partitioned trace distances enjoy similar properties to the standard trace distance , including the unitary invariance , the strong convexity and the close relations to the classical distances . the partitioned distances can not increase under quantum operations of certain kind including bistochastic maps . all the basic properties are re - formulated as majorization relations . possible applications to quantum information processing are briefly discussed .
