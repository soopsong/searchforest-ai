we consider theoretically the optomechanical interaction of several mechanical modes with a single quantized cavity field mode for linear and quadratic coupling . we focus specifically on situations where the optical dissipation is the dominant source of damping , in which case the optical field can be adiabatically eliminated , resulting in effective multimode interactions between the mechanical modes . in the case of linear coupling , the coherent contribution to the interaction can be exploited e.g. in quantum state swapping protocols , while the incoherent part leads to significant modifications of cold damping or amplification from the single - mode situation . quadratic coupling can result in a wealth of possible effective interactions including the analogs of second - harmonic generation and four - wave mixing in nonlinear optics , with specific forms depending sensitively on the sign of the coupling . the cavity - mediated mechanical interaction of two modes is investigated in two limiting cases , the resolved sideband and the doppler regime . as an illustrative application of the formal analysis we discuss in some detail a two - mode system where a bose - einstein condensate is optomechanically linearly coupled to the moving end mirror of a fabry - p\'erot cavity .
