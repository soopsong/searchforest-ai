we study the generation of strongly correlated photons by coupling an atom to photonic quantum fields in a one - dimensional waveguide . specifically , we consider a three - level or four - level system for the atom . photon - photon bound states emerge as a manifestation of the strong photon - photon correlation mediated by the atom . effective repulsive or attractive interaction between photons can be produced , causing either suppressed multiphoton transmission ( photon blockade ) or enhanced multiphoton transmission ( photon - induced tunneling ) . as a result , nonclassical light sources can be generated on demand by sending coherent states into the proposed system . we calculate the second - order correlation function of the transmitted field and observe bunching and antibunching caused by the bound states . furthermore , we demonstrate that the proposed system can produce photon pairs with a high degree of spectral entanglement , which have a large capacity for carrying information and are important for large - alphabet quantum communication .
