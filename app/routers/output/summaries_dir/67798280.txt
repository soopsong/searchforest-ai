we study the topological entanglement negativity between two spatial regions in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional chern - simons gauge theories by using the replica trick and the surgery method . for a bipartitioned or tripartitioned spatial manifold , we show how the topological entanglement negativity depends on the presence of quasiparticles and the choice of ground states . in particular , for two adjacent non - contractible regions on a tripartitioned torus , the entanglement negativity provides a simple way to distinguish abelian and non - abelian theories . our method applies to a chern - simons gauge theory defined on an arbitrary oriented ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime manifold . our results agree with the edge theory approach in a recent work ( x. wen , s. matsuura and s. ryu , arxiv:1603.08534 ) .
