we introduce the general parameter q_pb that provides an experimentally accessible nonclassicality measure for light . the parameter is quantified by the click statistics obtained from on - off detectors in a general multiplexing detection setup . sub - poisson - binomial statistics , observed by q_pb<0 , indicates that a given state of light is nonclassical . our new parameter replaces the binomial parameter q_b for more general cases , where any unbalance among the multiplexed modes is allowed , thus enabling the use of arbitrary multiplexing schemes . the significance of the parameter q_pb is theoretically examined in a measurement setup that only consists of a ring resonator and a single on - off detector . the proposed setup exploits minimal experimental resources and is geared towards a fully integrated quantum nanophotonic circuit . the results show that nonclassical features remain noticeable even in the presence of significant losses , rendering the new nonclassicality test more practical and flexible to be used in various nanophotonic platforms .
