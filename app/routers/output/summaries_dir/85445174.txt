we apply the measurement reduction technique to optimally reconstruct an object image from multiplexed ghost images ( gi ) while taking into account both gi correlations and object image sparsity . we show that one can reconstruct an image in that way even if the object is illuminated by a small photon number . we consider frequency gi multiplexing using coupled parametric processes . we revealed that the imaging condition depends on the type of parametric process , namely , whether down- or up - conversion is used . influence of information about sparsity in discrete cosine transform and haar transform bases on reconstruction quality is studied . in addition , we compared ordinary and ghost images when the detectors are additionally illuminated by noise photons in a computer experiment , which showed increased noise immunity of gi , especially with processing via the proposed technique .
