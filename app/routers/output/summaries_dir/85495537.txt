we investigate the performance of a certain nonclassicality identifier , expressed via integrated second - order intensity moments of optical fields , in revealing bipartite entanglement of quantum - optical frequency combs ( qofcs ) , which are generated in both spontaneous and stimulated parametric down - conversion processes . we show that , by utilizing that nonclassicality identifier , one can well identify the entanglement of the qofc directly from the experimentally measured intensity moments without invoking any state reconstruction techniques or homodyne detection . moreover , we demonstrate that the stimulated generation of the qofc improves the entanglement detection of these fields with the nonclassicality identifier . additionally , we show that the nonclassicality identifier can be expressed in a factorized form of detectors quantum efficiencies and the number of modes , if the qofc consists of many copies of the same two - mode twin beam . as an example , we apply the nonclassicality identifier to two specific types of qofc , where : ( i ) the qofc consists of many independent two - mode twin beams with non - overlapped spatial frequency modes , and ( ii ) the qofc contains entangled spatial frequency modes which are completely overlapped , i.e. , each mode is entangled with all the remaining modes in the system . we show that , in both cases , the nonclassicality identifier can reveal bipartite entanglement of the qofc including noise , and that it becomes even more sensitive for the stimulated processes .
