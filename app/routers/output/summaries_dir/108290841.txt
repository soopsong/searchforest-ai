we investigate several problems in entanglement theory from the perspective of convex optimization . this list of problems comprises ( a ) the decision whether a state is multi - party entangled , ( b ) the minimization of expectation values of entanglement witnesses with respect to pure product states , ( c ) the closely related evaluation of the geometric measure of entanglement to quantify pure multi - party entanglement , ( d ) the test whether states are multi - party entangled on the basis of witnesses based on second moments and on the basis of linear entropic criteria , and ( e ) the evaluation of instances of maximal output purities of quantum channels . we show that these problems can be formulated as certain optimization problems : as polynomially constrained problems employing polynomials of degree three or less . we then apply very recently established known methods from the theory of semi - definite relaxations to the formulated optimization problems . by this construction we arrive at a hierarchy of efficiently solvable approximations to the solution , approximating the exact solution as closely as desired , in a way that is asymptotically complete . for example , this results in a hierarchy of novel , efficiently decidable sufficient criteria for multi - particle entanglement , such that every entangled state will necessarily be detected in some step of the hierarchy . finally , we present numerical examples to demonstrate the practical accessibility of this approach .
