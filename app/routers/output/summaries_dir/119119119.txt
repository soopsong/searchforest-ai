optical field fluctuations in self - defocusing media can be described in terms of sound waves in a 2d photon - fluid . it is shown that , while the background fluid couples with the usual flat metric , sound - like waves experience an effective curved spacetime determined by the physical properties of the flow . in an optical cavity configuration , the background spacetime can be suitably controlled by the driving beam allowing the formation of acoustic ergoregions and event horizons . an experiment simulating the main features of the rotating black hole geometry is proposed .
