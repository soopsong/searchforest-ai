we study massless scalar theory with the quartic self - interacting term far away from and near to evaporating and spherically symmetric black hole . we propose a principle of how to define the physical notion of particle in curved space - time . employing this definition , we compute one - loop correction to the self - energy and coupling constant of the scalar field near the horizon in the freely - falling frame . we find that the coupling constant becomes slightly stronger near to the horizon . we also find that the term in the 2-point function that is ( partially ) responsible for the black - hole evaporation corresponds to the sub - leading correction to the feynman propagator whose pole structure is of the leading order .
