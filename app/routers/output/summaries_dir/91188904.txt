we study using large deviation theory the fluctuations of time - integrated functionals or observables of the unbiased random walk evolving on erd\"os - r\'enyi random graphs , and construct a modified , biased random walk that explains how these fluctuations arise in the long - time limit . two observables are considered : the sum of the degrees visited by the random walk and the sum of their logarithm , related to the trajectory entropy . the modified random walk is used for both quantities to explain how sudden changes in degree fluctuations , akin to dynamical phase transitions , are related to localization transitions . for the second quantity , we also establish links between the large deviations of the trajectory entropy and the maximum entropy random walk .
