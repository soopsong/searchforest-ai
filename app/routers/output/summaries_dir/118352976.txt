the last two decades have seen tremendous advances in our ability to generate and manipulate quantum coherence in mesoscopic superconducting circuits . these advances have opened up the study of quantum optics of microwave photons in superconducting circuits as well as providing important hardware for the manipulation of quantum information . focusing primarily on charge - based qubits , we provide a brief overview of these developments and discuss the present state of the art . we also survey the remarkable progress that has been made in realizing circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in which superconducting artificial atoms are strongly coupled to individual microwave photons .
