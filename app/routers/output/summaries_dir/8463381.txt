this paper considers the problem of robust stability for a class of uncertain nonlinear quantum systems subject to unknown perturbations in the system hamiltonian . the nominal system is a linear quantum system defined by a linear vector of coupling operators and a quadratic hamiltonian . this paper extends previous results on the robust stability of nonlinear quantum systems to allow for quantum systems with dynamic uncertainties . these dynamic uncertainties are required to satisfy a certain quantum stochastic integral quadratic constraint . the robust stability condition is given in terms of a strict bounded real condition . this result is applied to the robust stability analysis of an optical parametric amplifier .
