we discuss a practical design for tunably coupling a pair of flux qubits via the quantum inductance of a third high - frequency qubit . the design is particularly well suited for realizing a recently proposed microwave - induced parametric coupling scheme . this is attractive because the qubits can always remain at their optimal points . furthermore , we will show that the resulting coupling also has an optimal point where it is insensitive to low - frequency flux noise . this is an important feature for the coherence of coupled qubits . the presented scheme is an experimentally realistic way of carrying out two - qubit gates and should be easily extended to multiqubit systems .
