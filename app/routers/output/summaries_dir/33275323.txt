in this work we show that a tunable coupling between microwave resonators can be engineered by means of simple josephson junctions circuits , such as dc- and rf - squids . we show that by controlling the time dependence of the coupling it is possible to switch on and off and modulate the cross - talk , boost the interaction towards the ultrastrong regime , as well as to engineer red and blue sideband couplings , nonlinear photon hopping and classical gauge fields . we discuss how these dynamically tunable superconducting circuits enable key applications in the fields of all optical quantum computing , continuous variable quantum information and quantum simulation - all within the reach of state of the art in circuit - qed experiments .
