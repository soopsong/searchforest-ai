nonequilibrium conditions are traditionally seen as detrimental to the appearance of quantum - coherent many - body phenomena , and much effort is often devoted to their elimination . recently this approach has changed : it has been realized that driven - dissipative could be used as a resource . by proper engineering of the reservoirs and their couplings to a system , one may drive the system towards desired quantum - correlated steady states , even in the absence of internal hamiltonian dynamics . an intriguing category of equilibrium many - particle phases are those which are distinguished by topology rather than by symmetry . a natural question thus arises : which of these topological states can be achieved as the result of purely dissipative lindblad - type ( markovian ) evolution ? beside its fundamental importance , it may offer novel routes to the realization of topologically - nontrivial states in quantum simulators , especially ultracold atomic gases . in this work i go beyond previous studies in giving a general answer to this question in the context of gaussian ( " integer " ) topological states , concentrating on 2d chern insulators as the main example . on the one hand i prove a no - go theorem which shows that such dynamics can not lead to a topological robust ( gapped liouvillian ) unique pure steady state as the result of finite - range liouvillian . on the other hand , i construct a recipe showing that , under the above conditions , a pure topological steady state may result if exponetially - local liouvillian is allowed . if strictly local evolution is insisted upon , a mixed steady state arbitrarily close to the desired pure state may be obtained . i will also show how such dynamics could be realized with ultracold atoms and similar systems , and how the resulting states may be detected and topologically - classified . extension to other types of topological insulators and superconductors is also discussed .
