we demonstrate a direct mapping of max k - sat problems ( and weighted max k - sat ) to a chimera graph , which is the non - planar hardware graph of the devices built by d - wave systems inc . we further show that this mapping can be used to map a similar class of maximum satisfiability problems where the clauses are replaced by parity checks over potentially large numbers of bits . the latter is of specific interest for applications in decoding for communication . we discuss an example in which the decoding of a turbo code , which has been demonstrated to perform near the shannon limit , can be mapped to a chimera graph . the weighted max k - sat problem is the most general class of satisfiability problems , so our result effectively demonstrates how any satisfiability problem may be directly mapped to a chimera graph . our methods faithfully reproduce the low energy spectrum of the target problems , so therefore may also be used for maximum entropy inference .
