we present a deterministic scheme for generating large - scale atomic w states in a cavity qed system via a simple expansion mechanism , which is realized only by a detuned interaction between two identical atoms and a vacuum cavity mode . with the presented scheme , a w - type bell pair can be created and an n - atom w state can be expanded to a 2n - atom w state with a unit probability of success in principle . no multi - atom gates , quantum memories or quantum non - demolition measurements are required , greatly simplifying the experimental realization of the scheme . the feasibility analysis shows that our expansion scheme can be implemented with state - of - the - art technologies . our scheme enables advances not only in quantum information and communication but also in quantum thermodynamics , where atomic w states plays a crucial role .
