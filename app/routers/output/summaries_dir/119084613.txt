there has been a rise in decoding quantum error correction codes with neural network based decoders , due to the good decoding performance achieved and adaptability to any noise model . however , the main challenge is scalability to larger code distances due to an exponential increase of the error syndrome space . note that , successfully decoding the surface code under realistic noise assumptions will limit the size of the code to less than 100 qubits with current neural network based decoders . such a problem can be tackled by a distributed way of decoding , similar to the renormalization group ( rg ) decoders . in this paper , we introduce a decoding algorithm that combines the concept of rg decoding and neural network based decoders . we tested the decoding performance under depolarizing noise with noiseless error syndrome measurements for the rotated surface code and compared against the blossom algorithm and a neural network based decoder . we show that similar level of decoding performance can be achieved between all tested decoders while providing a solution to the scalability issues of neural network based decoders .
