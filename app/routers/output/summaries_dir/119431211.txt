we develop an alternative boson sampling model operating on single - photon states followed by linear interferometry and gaussian measurements . the hardness proof for simulating such continuous - variable measurements is established in two main steps , making use of the symmetry of quantum evolution under time reversal . namely , we first construct a twofold version of scattershot boson sampling in which , as opposed to the original proposal , both legs of a collection of two - mode squeezed vacuum states undergo parallel linear - optical transformations . this twofold scattershot model yields , as a corollary , an instance of boson sampling from gaussian states where photon counting is hard to simulate . then , a time - reversed setup is used to exhibit a boson sampling model in which the simulation of gaussian measurements -- namely the outcome of eight - port homodyne detection -- is proven to be computationally hard . these results illustrate how the symmetry of quantum evolution under time reversal may serve as a tool for analyzing the computational complexity of novel physically - motivated computational problems .
