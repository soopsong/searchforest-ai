we define the task of { \it quantum tagging } , that is , authenticating the classical location of a classical tagging device by sending and receiving quantum signals from suitably located distant sites , in an environment controlled by an adversary whose quantum information processing and transmitting power is unbounded . we define simple security models for this task and briefly discuss alternatives . we illustrate the pitfalls of naive quantum cryptographic reasoning in this context by describing several protocols which at first sight appear unconditionally secure but which , as we show , can in fact be broken by teleportation - based attacks . we also describe some protocols which can not be broken by these specific attacks , but do not prove they are unconditionally secure . we review the history of quantum tagging protocols , which we first discussed in 2002 and described in a 2006 patent ( for an insecure protocol ) . the possibility has recently been reconsidered by other authors . all the more recently discussed protocols of which we are aware were either previously considered by us in 2002 - 3 or are variants of schemes then considered , and all are provably insecure .
