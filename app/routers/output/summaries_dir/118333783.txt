dirac sought an interpretation of mathematical formalism in terms of physical entities and einstein insisted that physics should describe"the real states of the real systems " . while bell inequalities put into question the reality of states , modern device - independent approaches do away with the idea of entities : physical theory may contain no physical systems . focusing on the correlations between operationally defined inputs and outputs , device - independent methods promote a view more distant from the conventional one than einstein 's ' principle theories ' were from ' constructive theories ' . on the examples of indefinite causal orders and almost quantum correlations , we ask a puzzling question : if physical theory is not about systems , then what is it about ? the answer given by the device - independent models is that physics is about languages . in moving away from the information - theoretic reconstructions of quantum theory , this answer marks a new conceptual development in the foundations of physics .
