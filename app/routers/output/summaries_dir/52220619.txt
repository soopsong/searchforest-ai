we investigate how discrete internal degrees of freedom in a quasi - macroscopic system affect the violation of the leggett -- garg inequality , a test of macroscopic - realism based on temporal correlation functions . as a specific example , we focus on an ensemble of qubits subject to collective and individual noise . this generic model can describe a range of physical systems , including atoms in cavities , electron or nuclear spins in nv centers in diamond , erbium in y$_2$sio$_5 $ , bismuth impurities in silicon , or arrays of superconducting circuits , to indicate but a few . such large ensembles are potentially more macroscopic than other systems that have been used so far for testing the leggett -- garg inequality , and open a route toward probing the boundaries of quantum mechanics at macroscopic scales . we find that , because of the non - trivial internal structure of such an ensemble , the behavior of different measurement schemes , under the influence of noise , can be surprising . we discuss which measurement schemes are optimal for flux qubits and nv centers , and some of the technological constraints and difficulties for observing such violations with present - day experiments .
