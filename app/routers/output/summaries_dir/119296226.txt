optically levitated nanoparticles have recently emerged as versatile platforms for investigating macroscopic quantum mechanics and enabling ultrasensitive metrology . in this article we theoretically consider two damping regimes of an optically levitated nanoparticle cooled by cavityless parametric feedback . our treatment is based on a generalized fokker - planck equation derived from the quantum master equation presented recently and shown to agree very well with experiment [ 1 ] . for low damping , we find that the resulting wigner function yields the single - peaked oscillator position distribution and recovers the appropriate energy distribution derived earlier using a classical theory and verified experimentally [ 2 ] . for high damping , in contrast , we predict a double - peaked position distribution , which we trace to an underlying bistability induced by feedback . unlike in cavity - based optomechanics , stochastic processes play a major role in determining the bistable behavior . to support our conclusions , we present analytical expressions as well as numerical simulations using the truncated wigner function approach . our work opens up the prospect of developing bistability - based devices , characterization of phase - space dynamics , and investigation of the quantum - classical transition using levitated nanoparticles .
