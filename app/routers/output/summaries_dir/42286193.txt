time - bin encoding is a robust form of optical quantum information , especially for transmission in optical fibers . to read out the information , the separation of the time bins must be larger than the detector time resolution , typically on the order of nanoseconds for photon counters . in the present work , we demonstrate a technique using a nonlinear interaction between chirped entangled time - bin photons and shaped laser pulses to perform projective measurements on arbitrary time - bin states with picosecond - scale separations . we demonstrate a tomographically - complete set of time - bin qubit projective measurements and show the fidelity of operations is sufficiently high to violate the chsh - bell inequality by more than 6 standard deviations .
