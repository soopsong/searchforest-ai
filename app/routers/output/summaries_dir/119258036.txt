we address the problem of compressing density operators defined on a finite dimensional hilbert space which assumes a tensor product decomposition . in particular , we look for an efficient procedure for learning the most likely density operator , according to jaynes ' principle , given a chosen set of partial information obtained from the unknown quantum system we wish to describe . for complexity reasons , we restrict our analysis to tree - structured sets of bipartite marginals . we focus on the tripartite scenario , where we solve the problem for the couples of measured marginals which are compatible with a quantum markov chain , providing then an algebraic necessary and sufficient condition for the compatibility to be verified . we introduce the generalization of the procedure to the n - partite scenario , giving some preliminary results . in particular , we prove that if the pairwise markov condition holds between the subparts then the choice of the best set of tree - structured bipartite marginals can be performed efficiently . moreover , we provide a new characterisation of quantum markov chains in terms of quantum bayesian updating processes .
