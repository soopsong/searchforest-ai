we discuss the bloch - messiah decomposition for the broadband squeezed light generated by type - i parametric down - conversion with monochromatic pump . using an exact solution for this process , we evaluate the squeezing parameters and the corresponding squeezing eigenmodes . next , we consider the magnus expansion of the quantum - mechanical evolution operator for this process and obtain its first three approximation orders . using these approximated solutions , we evaluate the corresponding approximations for the bloch - messiah decomposition . our results allow us to conclude that the first - order approximation of the magnus expansion is sufficient for description of the broadband squeezed light for squeezing values below 12.5 db . for higher degrees of squeezing we show fast convergence of the magnus series providing a good approximation for the exact solution already in the third order . we propose a quantitative criterion for this ultra - high - gain regime of parametric down - conversion when the higher - orders terms of the magnus expansion , known in the literature as the operator - ordering effects , become necessary .
