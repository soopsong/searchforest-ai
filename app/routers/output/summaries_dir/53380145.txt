recently , the fast development of quantum technologies led to the need for tools allowing the characterization of quantum resources . in particular , the ability to estimate non - classical aspects , e.g. entanglement and quantum discord , in two - qubit systems , is relevant to optimise the performance of quantum information processes . here we present an experiment in which the amount of entanglement and discord are measured exploiting different estimators . among them , some will prove to be optimal , i.e. , able to reach the ultimate precision bound allowed by quantum mechanics . these estimation techniques have been tested with a specific family of states ranging from nearly pure bell states to completely mixed states . this work represents a significant step in the development of reliable metrological tools for quantum technologies .
