we prove stability of the spectral gap for gapped , frustration - free hamiltonians under general , quasi - local perturbations . we present a necessary and sufficient condition for stability , which we call"local topological quantum order"and show that this condition implies an area law for the entanglement entropy of the groundstate subspace . this result extends previous work by bravyi et al . , on the stability of topological quantum order for hamiltonians composed of commuting projections with a common zero - energy subspace . we conclude with a list of open problems relevant to spectral gaps and topological quantum order .
