we develop a general technique for proving convergence of repeated quantum interactions to the solution of a quantum stochastic differential equation . the wide applicability of the method is illustrated in a variety of examples . our main theorem , which is based on the trotter - kato theorem , is not restricted to a specific noise model and does not require boundedness of the limit coefficients .
