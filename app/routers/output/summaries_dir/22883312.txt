the development of quantum algorithms based on quantum versions of random walks is placed in the context of the emerging field of quantum computing . constructing a suitable quantum version of a random walk is not trivial ; pure quantum dynamics is deterministic , so randomness only enters during the measurement phase , i.e. when converting the quantum information into classical information . the outcome of a quantum random walk is very different from the corresponding classical random walk owing to the interference between the different possible paths . the upshot is that quantum walkers find themselves further from their starting point than a classical walker on average , and this forms the basis of a quantum speed up , which can be exploited to solve problems faster . surprisingly , the effect of making the walk slightly less than perfectly quantum can optimize the properties of the quantum walk for algorithmic applications . looking to the future , even with a small quantum computer available , the development of quantum walk algorithms might proceed more rapidly than it has , especially for solving real problems .
