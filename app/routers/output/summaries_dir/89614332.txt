the theory of relativity requires that no information travel faster than light , whereas the unitarity of quantum mechanics ensures that quantum information can not be cloned . these conditions provide the basic constraints that appear in information replication tasks , which formalize aspects of the behavior of information in relativistic quantum mechanics . in this article , we provide continuous variable ( cv ) strategies for spacetime quantum information replication that are directly amenable to optical or mechanical implementation . we use a new class of homologically - constructed cv quantum error correcting codes to provide efficient solutions for the general case of information replication . as compared to schemes encoding qubits , our cv solution requires half as many shares per encoded system . we also provide an optimized five - mode strategy for replicating quantum information in a particular configuration of four spacetime regions designed not to be reducible to previously performed experiments . for this optimized strategy , we provide detailed encoding and decoding procedures using standard optical apparatus and calculate the recovery fidelity when finite squeezing is used . as such we provide a scheme for experimentally realizing quantum information replication using quantum optics .
