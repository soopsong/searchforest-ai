a major hurdle to the deployment of quantum linear systems algorithms and recent quantum simulation algorithms lies in the difficulty to find inexpensive reversible circuits for arithmetic using existing hand coded methods . motivated by recent advances in reversible logic synthesis , we synthesize arithmetic circuits using classical design automation flows and tools . the combination of classical and reversible logic synthesis enables the automatic design of large components in reversible logic starting from well - known hardware description languages such as verilog . as a prototype example for our approach we automatically generate high quality networks for the reciprocal $ 1 / x$ , which is necessary for quantum linear systems algorithms .
