the algebraic quantification of nonclassicality , which naturally arises from the quantum superposition principle , is related to properties of regular nonclassicality quasiprobabilities . the latter are obtained by non - gaussian filtering of the glauber - sudarshan $ p$~function . they yield lower bounds for the degree of nonclassicality . we also derive bounds for convex combinations of gaussian states for certifying quantum non - gaussianity directly from the experimentally accessible nonclassicality quasiprobabilities . other quantum - state representations , such as $ s$-parametrized quasiprobabilities , insufficiently indicate or even fail to directly uncover detailed information on the properties of quantum states . as an example , our approach is applied to multi - photon - added squeezed vacuum states .
