random number generators are essential to ensure performance in information technologies , including cryptography , stochastic simulations and massive data processing . the quality of random numbers ultimately determines the security and privacy that can be achieved , while the speed at which they can be generated poses limits to the utilisation of the available resources . in this work we propose and demonstrate a quantum entropy source for random number generation on an indium phosphide photonic integrated circuit made possible by a new design using two - laser interference and heterodyne detection . the resulting device offers high - speed operation with unprecedented security guarantees and reduced form factor . it is also compatible with complementary metal - oxide semiconductor technology , opening the path to its integration in computation and communication electronic cards , which is particularly relevant for the intensive migration of information processing and storage tasks from local premises to cloud data centres .
