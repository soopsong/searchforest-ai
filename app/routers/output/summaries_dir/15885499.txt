we derive noncommutative multi - particle quantum mechanics from noncommutative quantum field theory in the nonrelativistic limit . paricles of opposite charges are found to have opposite noncommutativity . as a result , there is no noncommutative correction to the hydrogen atom spectrum at the tree level . we also comment on the obstacles to take noncommutative phenomenology seriously , and propose a way to construct noncommutative su(5 ) grand unified theory .
