continuous variable entanglement is a fundamental resource for many quantum information tasks . important protocols like superactivation of zero - capacity channels and finite - size quantum cryptography that provides security against most general attacks , require about 10 db two - mode squeezing . additionally , stable phase control mechanisms are necessary but are difficult to achieve because the total amount of optical loss to the entangled beams needs to be small . here , we experimentally demonstrate a control scheme for two - mode squeezed vacuum states at the telecommunication wavelength of 1550 nm . our states exhibited an einstein - podolsky - rosen covariance product of 0.0309 \pm 0.0002 , where 1 is the critical value , and a duan inseparability value of 0.360 \pm 0.001 , where 4 is the critical value . the latter corresponds to 10.45 \pm 0.01 db which reflects the average non - classical noise suppression of the two squeezed vacuum states used to generate the entanglement . with the results of this work demanding quantum information protocols will become feasible .
