a powerful theoretical structure has emerged in recent years on the characterization and quantification of entanglement in continuous - variable systems . after reviewing this framework , we will illustrate it with an original set - up based on a type - ii opo with adjustable mode coupling . experimental results allow a direct verification of many theoretical predictions and provide a sharp insight into the general properties of two - mode gaussian states and entanglement resource manipulation .
