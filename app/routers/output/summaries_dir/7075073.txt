we investigate the single qubit transformations under several typical coherence - free operations , such as , incoherent operation ( io ) , strictly incoherent operation ( sio ) , physically incoherent operation ( pio ) , and coherence preserving operation ( cpo ) . quantitative connection has been built between io and sio in single qubit systems . moreover , these coherence - free operations have a clear hierarchical relationship in single qubit systems : cpo $ \subset$ pio $ \subset$ sio = io . a new and explicit proof for the necessary and sufficient condition of single qubit transformation via io or sio has been provided , which indicates that sio with only two kraus operators are enough to realize this transformation . the transformation regions of single qubits via cpo and pio are also given . our method provides a geometric illustration to analyze single qubit coherence transformations by introducing the bloch sphere depiction of the transformation regions , and tells us how to construct the corresponding coherence - free operations .
