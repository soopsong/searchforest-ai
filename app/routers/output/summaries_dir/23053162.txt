it has recently been shown that finding the optimal measurement on the environment for stationary linear quadratic gaussian control problems is a semi - definite program . we apply this technique to the control of the epr - correlations between two bosonic modes interacting via a parametric hamiltonian at steady state . the optimal measurement turns out to be nonlocal homodyne measurement -- the outputs of the two modes must be combined before measurement . we also find the optimal local measurement and control technique . this gives the same degree of entanglement but a higher degree of purity than the local technique previously considered [ s. mancini , phys . rev . a { \bf 73 } , 010304(r ) ( 2006 ) ] .
