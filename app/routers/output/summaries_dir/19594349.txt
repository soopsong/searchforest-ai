design of a doubly - clamped beam structure capable of localizing mechanical and optical energy at the nanoscale is presented . the optical design is based upon photonic crystal concepts in which patterning of a nanoscale - cross - section beam can result in strong optical localization to an effective optical mode volume of 0.2 cubic wavelengths ( ( \lambda_{c})^3 ) . by placing two identical nanobeams within the near field of each other , strong optomechanical coupling can be realized for differential motion between the beams . current designs for thin film silicon nitride beams at a wavelength of 1.5 microns indicate that such structures can simultaneously realize an optical q - factor of 7x10 ^ 6 , motional mass m~40 picograms , mechanical mode frequency ~170 mhz , and an optomechanical coupling factor ( g_{om}=d\omega_{c}/dx = \omega_{c}/l_{om } ) with effective length l_{om } ~ \lambda = 1.5 microns .
