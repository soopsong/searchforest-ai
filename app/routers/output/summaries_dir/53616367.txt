we present a detailed theoretical analysis of a weakly driven multimode optomechanical system , in which two optical modes are strongly and near - resonantly coupled to a single mechanical mode via a three - wave mixing interaction . we calculate one- and two - time intensity correlations of the two optical fields and compare them to analogous correlations in atom - cavity systems . nonclassical photon correlations arise when the optomechanical coupling $ g$ exceeds the cavity decay rate $ \kappa$ , and we discuss signatures of one- and two - photon resonances as well as quantum interference . we also find a long - lived correlation that decays slowly with the mechanical decay rate $ \gamma$ , reflecting the heralded preparation of a single phonon state after detection of a photon . our results provide insight into the quantum regime of multimode optomechanics , with potential applications for quantum information processing with photons and phonons .
