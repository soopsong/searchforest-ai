we demonstrate heralded qubit amplification for time - bin and fock - state qubits in an all - fibre , telecom - wavelength , scheme that highlights the simplicity , the stability and potential for fully integrated photonic solutions . exploiting high - efficiency superconducting detectors , the gain , the fidelity and the performance of the amplifier are studied as a function of loss . we also demonstrate the first heralded fock - state qubit amplifier without post - selection . this provides a significant advance towards demonstrating device - independent quantum key distribution as well as fundamental tests of quantum mechanics over extended distances .
