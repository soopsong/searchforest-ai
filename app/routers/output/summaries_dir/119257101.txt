the entanglement entropy for a quantum critical system across a boundary with a corner exhibits a sub - leading logarithmic scaling term with a scale - invariant coefficient . using a numerical linked cluster expansion , we calculate this universal quantity for a square - lattice bilayer heisenberg model at its quantum critical point . we find , for this 2 + 1 dimensional o(3 ) universality class , that it is thrice the value calculated previously for the ising universality class . this relation gives substantial evidence that this coefficient provides a measure of the number of degrees of freedom of the theory , analogous to the central charge in a 1 + 1 dimensional conformal field theory .
