we consider a correlated bose gas tightly confined into a ring shaped lattice , in the presence of an artificial gauge potential inducing a persistent current through it . a weak link painted on the ring acts as a source of coherent back - scattering for the propagating gas , interfering with the forward scattered current . this system defines an atomic counterpart of the rf - squid : the atomtronics quantum interference device ( aquid ) . the goal of the present study is to corroborate the emergence of an effective two - level system in such a setup and to assess its quality , in terms of its inner resolution and its separation from the rest of the many - body spectrum , across the different physical regimes . in order to achieve this aim , we examine the dependence of the qubit energy gap on the bosonic density , the interaction strength , and the barrier depth , and we show how the superposition between current states appears in the momentum distribution ( time - of - flight ) images . a mesoscopic ring lattice with intermediate - to - strong interactions and weak barrier depth is found to be a favorable candidate for setting up , manipulating and probing a qubit in the next generation of atomic experiments .
