in this work , we investigate the properties of four - wave mixing bragg scattering in a configuration that employs orthogonally polarized pumps in a birefringent waveguide . this configuration enables a large signal conversion bandwidth , and allows strongly unidirectional frequency conversion as undesired bragg - scattering processes are suppressed by waveguide birefringence . moreover , we show that this form of four - wave mixing bragg scattering preserves the ( arbitrary ) signal pulse shape , even when driven by pulsed pumps .
