in past work we introduced a method which allows for exact computations of entanglement hamiltonians . the method relies on computing the resolvent for the projected ( on the entangling region ) green 's function using a solution to the riemann - hilbert problem combined with finite rank perturbation theory . here we analyze in detail several examples involving excited states of chiral fermions ( dirac and majorana ) on a spatial circle . we compute the exact entanglement hamiltonians and an exact formula for the change in entanglement entropy due to the introduction of a particle above the dirac sea . for dirac fermions , we give the first - order temperature correction to the entanglement entropy in the case of a multiple interval entangling region .
