we provide a non - deterministic quantum protocol that approximates the single qubit rotations r_x(2a^2 b^2)$ using r_x(2a ) and r_x(2b ) and a constant number of clifford and t operations . we then use this method to construct a"floating point"implementation of a small rotation wherein we use the aforementioned method to construct the exponent part of the rotation and also to combine it with a mantissa . this causes the cost of the synthesis to depend more strongly on the relative ( rather than absolute ) precision required . we analyze the mean and variance of the \tcount required to use our techniques and provide new lower bounds for the t - count for ancilla free synthesis of small single - qubit axial rotations . we further show that our techniques can use ancillas to beat these lower bounds with high probability . we also discuss the t - depth of our method and see that the vast majority of the cost of the resultant circuits can be shifted to parallel computation paths .
