currently available quantum computing hardware platforms have limited 2-qubit connectivity among their addressable qubits . in order to run a generic quantum algorithm on such a platform , one has to transform the initial logical quantum circuit describing the algorithm into an equivalent one that obeys the connectivity restrictions . in this work we construct a circuit synthesis scheme that takes as input the qubit connectivity graph and a quantum circuit over the gate set generated by $ \{\text{cnot},r_{z}\}$ and outputs a circuit that respects the connectivity of the device . as a concrete application , we apply our techniques to google 's bristlecone 72-qubit quantum chip connectivity , ibm 's tokyo 20-qubit quantum chip connectivity , and rigetti 's acorn 19-qubit quantum chip connectivity . in addition , we also compare the performance of our scheme as a function of sparseness of randomly generated quantum circuits . note : recently , the authors of arxiv:1904.00633 independently presented a similar optimization scheme . our work is independent of arxiv:1904.00633 , being a longer version of the seminar presented by beatrice nash at the dagstuhl seminar 18381 : quantum programming languages , pg . 120 , september 2018 , dagstuhl , germany , slide deck available online at https://materials.dagstuhl.de/files/18/18381/18381.beatricenash.slides.pdf .
