the mechanism of decoherence for a quantum system with rotational degrees of freedom is studied . from a simple model of elastic scattering , we show that the non - diagonal density matrix elements of the system exponentially decay . the decay rate depends on the difference of scattering amplitudes for different rotational configurations , leading to the gradual loss of quantum coherence between the pointer states in the system orientational space . for a dielectric ellipsoid immersed in a photon - gas environment ( assuming no absorption ) , the decay rate is found to be proportional to the seventh power of the temperature . for an ellipsoidal object interacting with mass particles , the decay rate is proportional to the 5/2 power of the temperature . both are different from the case of translational decoherence induced by the same environment scattering . for photon scattering , the coherence time in the rotational degrees of freedom is shown to be much shorter than that in the translational degrees of freedom .
