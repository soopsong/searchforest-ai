we introduce a composition of quantum states of a bipartite system which is based on the reshuffling of density matrices . this non - abelian product is associative and stems from the composition of quantum maps acting on a simple quantum system . it induces a semi - group in the subset of states with maximally mixed partial traces . subadditivity of the von neumann entropy with respect to this product is proved . it is equivalent to subadditivity of the entropy of bistochastic maps with respect to their composition , where the entropy of a map is the entropy of the corresponding state under the jamiolkowski isomorphism . strong dynamical subadditivity of a concatenation of three bistochastic maps is established . analogous bounds for the entropy of a composition are derived for general stochastic maps . in the classical case they lead to new bounds for the entropy of a product of two stochastic matrices .
