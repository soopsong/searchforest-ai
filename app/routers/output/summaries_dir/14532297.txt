it is shown that spatial correlation functions measured for correlated photon pairs at the single - photon level correspond to speckle patterns visible at high intensities . this correspondence is observed for the first time in one experimental setup by using different acquisition modes of an intensified ccd camera in low and high intensity regimes . the behavior of intensity auto- and cross - correlation functions in dependence on pump - beam parameters including power and transverse profile is investigated .
