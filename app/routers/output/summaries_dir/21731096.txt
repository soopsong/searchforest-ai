markov states have been defined for tripartite quantum systems . in this paper , we generalize the definition of the markov states to arbitrary multipartite case and find the general structure of an important subset of them , which we will call strong markov states . in addition , we focus on an important property of the markov states : if the initial state of the whole system - environment is a markov state , then each localized dynamics of the whole system - environment reduces to a localized subdynamics of the system . this provides us a necessary condition for entanglement revival in an open quantum system : entanglement revival can occur only when the system - environment state is not a markov state . to illustrate ( a part of ) our results , we consider the case that the environment is modeled as classical . in this case , though the correlation between the system and the environment remains classical during the evolution , the change of the state of the system - environment , from its initial markov state to a state which is not a markov one , leads to the entanglement revival in the system . this shows that the non - markovianity of a state is not equivalent to the existence of non - classical correlation in it , in general .
