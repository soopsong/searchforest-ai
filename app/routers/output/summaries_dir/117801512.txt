the question under what conditions different witnesses may detect some entangled states simultaneously is answered for both finite- and infinite - dimensional bipartite systems . finite many different witnesses can detect some entangled states simultaneously if and only if their convex combinations are still witnesses ; they can not detect any entangled state simultaneously if and only if the set of their convex combinations contains a positive operator . for two witnesses $ w_1 $ and $ w_2 $ , some more can be said : ( 1 ) $ w_1 $ and $ w_2 $ can detect the same set of entangled states if and only if they are linearly dependent ; ( 2 ) $ w_2 $ can detect more entangled states than that $ w_1 $ can if and only if $ w_1 $ is a linear combination of $ w_2 $ and a positive operator . as an application , some characterizations of the optimal witnesses are given and some structure properties of the decomposable optimal witnesses are presented .
