we in this paper consider a further generalization of the ( optical ) holonomic quantum computation proposed by zanardi and rasetti ( quant - ph/9904011 ) , and reinforced by fujii ( quant - ph/9910069 ) and pachos and chountasis ( quant - ph/9912093 ) . we construct a quantum computational bundle on some parameter space , and calculate non - abelian berry connections and curvatures explicitly in the special cases . our main tool is unitary coherent operators based on lie algebras su(n+1 ) and su(n,1 ) , where the case of n = 1 is the previous one .
