particle indistinguishability is at the heart of quantum statistics that regulates fundamental phenomena such as the electronic band structure of solids , bose - einstein condensation and superconductivity . moreover , it is necessary in practical applications such as linear optical quantum computation and simulation , in particular for boson sampling devices . it is thus crucial to develop tools to certify genuine multiphoton interference between multiple sources . here we show that so - called sylvester interferometers are near - optimal for the task of discriminating the behaviors of distinguishable and indistinguishable photons . we report the first implementations of integrated sylvester interferometers with 4 and 8 modes with an efficient , scalable and reliable 3d - architecture . we perform two - photon interference experiments capable of identifying indistinguishable photon behaviour with a bayesian approach using very small data sets . furthermore , we employ experimentally this new device for the assessment of scattershot boson sampling . these results open the way to the application of sylvester interferometers for the optimal assessment of multiphoton interference experiments .
