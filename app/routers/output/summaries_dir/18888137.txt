the error threshold for fault - tolerant quantum computation with concatenated encoding of qubits is penalized by internal communication overhead . many quantum computation proposals rely on nearest neighbor communication , which requires excess gate operations . for a qubit stripe with a width of l+1 physical qubits implementing l levels of concatenation , we find that the error threshold of 2.1 / spl times/10 / sup -5/ without any communication burden is reduced to 1.2 / spl times/10 / sup -7/ when gate errors are the dominant source of error . this /spl sim/175 / spl times/ penalty in error threshold translates to an /spl sim/13 / spl times/ penalty in the amplitude and timing of gate operation control pulses .
