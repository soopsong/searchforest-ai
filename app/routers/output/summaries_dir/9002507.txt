we establish the classical capacity of optical quantum channels as a sharp transition between two regimes --- one which is an error - free regime for communication rates below the capacity , and the other in which the probability of correctly decoding a classical message converges exponentially fast to zero if the communication rate exceeds the classical capacity . this result is obtained by proving a strong converse theorem for the classical capacity of all phase - insensitive bosonic gaussian channels , a well - established model of optical quantum communication channels , such as lossy optical fibers , amplifier and free - space communication . the theorem holds under a particular photon - number occupation constraint , which we describe in detail in the paper . our result bolsters the understanding of the classical capacity of these channels and opens the path to applications , such as proving the security of noisy quantum storage models of cryptography with optical links .
