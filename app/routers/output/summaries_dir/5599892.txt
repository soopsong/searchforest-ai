in this paper we present a general method for estimating rates of accidental coincidence between a pair of single photon detectors operated within their saturation regimes . by folding the effects of recovery time of both detectors and the detection circuit into an"effective duty cycle"we are able to accomodate complex recovery behaviour at high event rates . as an example , we provide a detailed high - level model for the behaviour of passively quenched avalanche photodiodes , and demonstrate effective background subtraction at rates commonly associated with detector saturation . we show that by post - processing using the updated model , we observe an improvement in polarization correlation visibility from 88.7 % to 96.9 % in our experimental dataset . this technique will be useful in improving the signal - to - noise ratio in applications which depend on coincidence measurements , especially in situations where rapid changes in flux may cause detector saturation .
