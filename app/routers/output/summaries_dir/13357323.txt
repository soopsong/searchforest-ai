the effect of the hawking temperature on the entanglement and teleportation for the scalar field in a most general , static and asymptotically flat black hole with spherical symmetry has been investigated . it is shown that the same"initial entanglement"for the state parameter $ \alpha$ and its"normalized partners"$\sqrt{1-\alpha^{2}}$ will be degraded by the hawking effect with increasing hawking temperature along two different trajectories except for the maximally entangled state . in the infinite hawking temperature limit , corresponding to the case of the black hole evaporating completely , the state has no longer distillable entanglement for any $ \alpha$. it is interesting to note that the mutual information in this limit equals to just half of the"initially mutual information " . it has also been demonstrated that the fidelity of teleportation decreases as the hawking temperature increases , which just indicates the degradation of entanglement .
