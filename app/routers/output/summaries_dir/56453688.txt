we present an efficient photon - echo experiment based on atomic frequency combs [ phys . rev . a 79 , 052329 ( 2009 ) ] . echoes containing an energy of up to 35 % of that of the input pulse are observed in a pr3 + -doped y2sio5 crystal . this material allows for the precise spectral holeburning needed to make a sharp and highly absorbing comb structure . we compare our results with a simple theoretical model with satisfactory agreement . our results show that atomic frequency combs has the potential for high - efficiency storage of single photons as required in future long - distance communication based on quantum repeaters .
