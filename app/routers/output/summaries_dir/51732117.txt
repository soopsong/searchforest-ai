we establish a novel approach to probing spatially resolved multi - time correlation functions of interacting many - body systems , with scalable experimental overhead . specifically , designing nonlinear measurement protocols for multidimensional spectra in a chain of trapped ions with single - site addressability enables us , e.g. , to distinguish coherent from incoherent transport processes , to quantify potential anharmonicities , and to identify decoherence - free subspaces .
