recently , motes , gilchrist , dowling&rohde [ phys . rev . lett . 113 , 120501 ( 2014 ) ] presented a scheme for photonic boson - sampling using a fiber - loop architecture . here we show that the same architecture can be modified to implement full , universal linear optics quantum computing , in various incarnations . the scheme employs two embedded fiber - loops , a single push - button photon source , three dynamically controlled beamsplitters , and a single time - resolved photo - detector . the architecture has only a single point of interference , and thus may be significantly easier to align than other schemes . the experimental complexity of the scheme is constant , irrespective of the size of the computation , limited only by fiber lengths and their respective loss rates .
