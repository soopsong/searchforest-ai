the negatively - charged silicon - vacancy ( $ \mathrm{siv}^{-}$ ) center in diamond is a bright source of indistinguishable single photons and a useful resource in quantum information protocols . until now , $ \mathrm{siv}^{-}$ centers with narrow optical linewidths and small inhomogeneous distributions of $ \mathrm{siv}^{-}$ transition frequencies have only been reported in samples doped with silicon during diamond growth . we present a technique for producing implanted $ \mathrm{siv}^{-}$ centers with nearly lifetime - limited optical linewidths and a small inhomogeneous distribution . these properties persist after nanofabrication , paving the way for incorporation of high - quality $ \mathrm{siv}^{-}$ centers into nanophotonic devices .
