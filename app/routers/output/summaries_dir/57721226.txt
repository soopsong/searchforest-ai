in this paper , we introduce the model of quantum mealy machines and study the equivalence checking and minimisation problems of them . two efficient algorithms are developed for checking equivalence of two states in the same machine and for checking equivalence of two machines . they are applied in experiments of equivalence checking of quantum circuits . moreover , it is shown that the minimisation problem is proved to be in \textbf{pspace } .
