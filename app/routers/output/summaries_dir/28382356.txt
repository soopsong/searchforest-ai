while dissipation is widely considered as being harmful for quantum coherence , it can , when properly engineered , lead to the stabilization of non - trivial pure quantum states . we propose a scheme for continuous generation and stabilization of schr\"{o}dinger cat states in a cavity using dissipation engineering . we first generate non - classical photon states with definite parity by means of a two - photon drive and dissipation , and then stabilize these transient states against single - photon decay . the single - photon stabilization is autonomous , and is implemented through a second engineered bath , which exploits the photon number dependent frequency - splitting due to kerr interactions in the strongly dispersive regime of circuit qed . starting with the hamiltonian of the baths plus cavity , we derive an effective model of only the cavity photon states along with analytic expressions for relevant physical quantities , such as the stabilization rate . the deterministic generation of such cat states is one of the key ingredients in performing universal quantum computation .
