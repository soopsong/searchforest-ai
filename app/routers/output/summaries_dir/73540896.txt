quantum information processing ( qip ) offers the promise of being able to do things that we can not do with conventional technology . here we present a new route for distributed optical qip , based on generalized quantum non - demolition measurements , providing a unified approach for quantum communication and computing . interactions between photons are generated using weak non - linearities and intense laser fields -- the use of such fields provides for robust distribution of quantum information . our approach requires only a practical set of resources , and it uses these very efficiently . thus it promises to be extremely useful for the first quantum technologies , based on scarce resources . furthermore , in the longer term this approach provides both options and scalability for efficient many - qubit qip .
