we consider the problem of robustness in large consensus networks that occur in many areas such as distributed optimization . robustness , in this context , is the scaling of performance measures , e.g. h2-norm , as a function of network dimension . we provide a formal framework to quantify the relation between such performance scaling and the convergence speed of the network . specifically , we provide upper and lower bounds for the convergence speed in terms of robustness and discuss how these bounds scale with the network topology . the main contribution of this work is that we obtain tight bounds , that hold regardless of network topology . the work here also encompasses some results in convergence time analysis in previous literature .
