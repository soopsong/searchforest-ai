we derive a family of stochastic master equations describing homodyne measurement of multi - qubit diagonal observables in circuit quantum electrodynamics . in the regime where qubit decay can be neglected , our approach replaces the polaron - like transformation of previous work , which required a lengthy calculation for the physically interesting case of three qubits and two resonator modes . the technique introduced here makes this calculation straightforward and manifestly correct . using this technique , we are able to show that registers larger than one qubit evolve under a non - markovian master equation . we perform numerical simulations of the three - qubit , two - mode case from previous work , obtaining an average post - measurement state fidelity of $ \sim 94\%$ , limited by measurement - induced decoherence and dephasing .
