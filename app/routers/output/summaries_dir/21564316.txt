hybrid quantum information protocols are based on local qubits , such as trapped atoms , nv centers , and quantum dots , coupled to photons . the coupling is achieved through optical cavities . here we demonstrate far - field optimized h1 photonic crystal membrane cavities combined with an additional back reflection mirror below the membrane that meet the optical requirements for implementing hybrid quantum information protocols . using numerical optimization we find that 80 % of the light can be radiated within an objective numerical aperture of 0.8 , and the coupling to a single - mode fiber can be as high as 92 % . we experimentally prove the unique external mode matching properties by resonant reflection spectroscopy with a cavity mode visibility above 50 % .
