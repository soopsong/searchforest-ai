we consider three modes $ a$ , $ b$ and $ c$ and derive continuous variable monogamy inequalities that constrain the distribution of bipartite entanglement amongst the three modes . the inequalities hold for all such tripartite states , without the assumption of gaussian states , and are based on measurements of two conjugate quadrature phase amplitudes $ x_{i}$ and $ p_{i}$ at each mode $ i = a , b$. the first monogamy inequality is $ d_{ba}+d_{bc}\geq1 $ where $ d_{ba}<1 $ is the widely used symmetric entanglement criterion , for which $ d_{ba}$ is the sum of the variances of $ ( x_{a}-x_{b})/2 $ and $ ( p_{a}+p_{b})/2$. a second monogamy inequality is $ ent_{ba}ent_{bc}\geq\frac{1}{\left(1+(g_{ba}^{(sym)})^{2}\right)\left(1+(g_{bc}^{(sym)})^{2}\right)}$ where $ ent_{ba}<1 $ is the epr variance product criterion for entanglement . here $ ent_{ba}$ is a normalised product of variances of $ x_{b}-g_{ba}^{(sym)}x_{a}$ and $ p_{b}+g_{ba}^{(sym)}p_{a}$ , and $ g_{ba}^{(sym)}$ is a parameter that gives a measure of the symmetry between the moments of $ a$ and $ b$. we also show that the monogamy bounds are increased if a standard steering criterion for the steering of $ b$ is not satisfied . we illustrate the monogamy for continuous variable tripartite entangled states including the effects of losses and noise , and identify regimes of saturation of the inequalities . the monogamy relations explain the experimentally observed saturation at $ d_{ab}=0.5 $ for the entanglement between $ a$ and $ b$ when both modes have 50\% losses , and may be useful to establish rigorous bounds of correlation for the purpose of quantum key distribution protocols .
