plasma in low earth orbit can damage electronic components and potentially jeopardise the scientific missions in space . predicting the accumulated damage and understanding the components ' radiation tolerance are important to mission planning . in this manuscript we report on the observed radiation tolerance of single photon detectors and a liquid crystal polarization rotator . we conclude that an uncooled si apd could continue to operate from more than a month up to beyond the lifetime of the satellite depending on the orbit . the polarization rotator was also unaffected by the exposed dosage .
