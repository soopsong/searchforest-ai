we report photonic quantum circuits created using an ultrafast laser processing technique that is rapid , requires no lithographic mask and can be used to create three - dimensional networks of waveguide devices . we have characterized directional couplers -- the key functional elements of photonic quantum circuits -- and found that they perform as well as lithographically produced waveguide devices . we further demonstrate high - performance interferometers and an important multi - photon quantum interference phenomenon for the first time in integrated optics . this direct - write approach will enable the rapid development of sophisticated quantum optical circuits and their scaling into three - dimensions .
