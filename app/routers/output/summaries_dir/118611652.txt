we study the creation of knotted ultracold matter waves in bose - einstein condensates via coherent two - photon raman transitions with a $ \lambda$ level configuration . the raman transition allows an indirect transfer of atoms from the internal state $ \left| a \right\rangle$ to the target state $ \left| b \right\rangle$ via an excited state $ \left| e \right\rangle$ , that would be otherwise dipole - forbidden . this setup enables us to imprint three - dimensional knotted vortex lines embedded in the the probe field to the density in the target state . we elaborate on experimental feasibility as well as on subsequent dynamics of the matter wave .
