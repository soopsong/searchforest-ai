a recent proposal for mixed dynamics of classical and quantum ensembles is shown , in contrast to other proposals , to satisfy the minimal algebraic requirements proposed by salcedo for any consistent formulation of such dynamics . generalised ehrenfest relations for the expectation values of classical and quantum observables are also obtained . it is further shown that additional desirable requirements , related to separability , may be satisfied under the assumption that only the configuration of the classical component is directly accessible to measurement , eg , via a classical pointer . although the mixed dynamics is formulated in terms of ensembles on configuration space , thermodynamic mixtures of such ensembles may be defined which are equivalent to canonical phase space ensembles on the classical sector . hence , the formulation appears to be both consistent and physically complete .
