the quantum trajectories method ( qtm ) is one of { the } frequently used methods for studying open quantum systems . { the main idea of this method is { the } evolution of wave functions which { describe the system ( as functions of time ) . then , } so - called quantum jumps are applied at { a } randomly selected point in time . { the } obtained system state is called as a trajectory . after averaging many single trajectories { , } we obtain the approximation of the behavior of { a } quantum system . } { this fact also allows } us to use parallel computation methods . in the article { , } we discuss the qtm package which is supported by the mpi technology . using mpi allowed { utilizing } the parallel computing for calculating the trajectories and averaging them -- as the effect of these actions { , } the time { taken by } calculations is shorter . in spite of using the c++ programming language , the presented solution is easy to utilize and does not need any advanced programming techniques . at the same time { , } it offers a higher performance than other packages realizing the qtm . it is especially important in the case of harder computational tasks { , } and the use of mpi allows { improving the } performance of particular problems which can be solved in the field of open quantum systems .
