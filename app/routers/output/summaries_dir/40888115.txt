we treat a position dependent quantum walk ( qw ) on the line which we assign two different time - evolution operators to positive and negative parts respectively . we call the model"the two - phase qw"here , which has been expected to be a mathematical model of the topological insulator . we obtain the stationary and time - averaged limit measures related to localization for the two - phase qw with one defect . this is the first result on localization for the two - phase qw . the analytical methods are mainly based on the splitted generating function of the solution for the eigenvalue problem , and the generating function of the weight of the passages of the model . in this paper , we call the methods"the splitted generating function method"and"the generating function method " , respectively . the explicit expression of the stationary measure is asymmetric for the origin , and depends on the initial state and the choice of the parameters of the model . on the other hand , the time - averaged limit measure has a starting point symmetry and localization effect heavily depends on the initial state and the parameters of the model . regardless of the strong effect of the initial state and the parameters , the time - averaged limit measure also suggests that localization can be always observed for our two - phase qw . furthermore , our results imply that there is an interesting relation between the stationary and time - averaged limit measures when the parameters of the model have specific periodicities , which suggests that there is a possibility that we can analyze localization of the two - phase qw with one defect from the stationary measure .
