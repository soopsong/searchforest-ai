the quantum fisher information matrix provides us with a tool to determine the precision , in any multiparametric estimation protocol , through quantum cram\'er - rao bound . in this work , we study simultaneous and individual estimation strategies using the density matrix vectorization method . two special heisenberg $ xy$ models are considered . the first one concerns the anisotropic $ xy$ model in which the temperature $ t$ and the anisotropic parameter $ \gamma$ are estimated . the second situation concerns the isotropic $ xy$ model submitted to an external magnetic field $ b$ in which the temperature and the magnetic field are estimated . our results show that the simultaneous strategy of multiple parameters is always advantageous and can provide a better precision than the individual strategy in the multiparameter estimation procedures .
