decoherence is the major stumbling block in the realization of a large - scale quantum computer . ingenious methods have been devised to overcome decoherence , but their success has been proven only for over - simplified models of system - environment interaction . whether such methods will be reliable in the face of more realistic models is a fundamental open question . in this partly pedagogical article , we study two toy models of quantum information processing , using the language of \emph{quantum walks } . decoherence is incorporated in 3 ways - by coupling to a noisy ` projective measurement ' system , and by coupling to oscillator and spin baths .
