in this work we analyse three quantum communication schemes for the generation of gaussian entanglement between two ground stations . communication occurs via a satellite over two independent atmospheric fading channels dominated by turbulence - induced beam wander . in our first scheme the engineering complexity remains largely on the ground transceivers , with the satellite acting simply as a reflector . although the channel state information of the two atmospheric channels remains unknown in this scheme , the gaussian entanglement generation between the ground stations can still be determined . on the ground , distillation and gaussification procedures can be applied , leading to a refined gaussian entanglement generation rate between the ground stations . we compare the rates produced by this first scheme with two competing schemes in which quantum complexity is added to the satellite , thereby illustrating the trade - off between space - based engineering complexity and the rate of ground - station entanglement generation .
