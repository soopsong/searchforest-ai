the dicke - ising model describes cavity quantum electrodynamics setups in which dipoles couple not only with the photonic cavity field but also to each other through dipole - dipole interaction . in this work we diagonalise such a model in terms of bosonic polaritonic operators for arbitrarily large values of the light - matter coupling and for values of the dipole - dipole interaction until the onset of the ferromagnetic ising phase transition . in order to accomplish this task we exploit higher order terms of the holstein - primakoff transformation , developing a general method which allows to solve the normal phase of the ising model in term of bosonic excitations for large values of the dipole - dipole interaction . our results shed light on the interplay between the dipole - dipole and the light - matter coupling strengths , and their effect on the virtual excitations which populate the ground - state when the interactions become comparable with the bare transition frequency .
