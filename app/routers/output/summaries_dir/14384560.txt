we analyze the magnitude of the radiation pressure and electrostrictive stresses exerted by light confined inside gaas semiconductor wgm optomechanical disk resonators , through analytical and numerical means , and find the electrostrictive force to be of prime importance . we investigate the geometric and photoelastic optomechanical coupling resulting respectively from the deformation of the disk boundary and from the strain - induced refractive index changes in the material , for various mechanical modes of the disks . photoelastic optomechanical coupling is shown to be a predominant coupling mechanism for certain disk dimensions and mechanical modes , leading to total coupling g$_{om}$ and g$_0 $ reaching respectively 3 thz / nm and 4 mhz . finally , we point towards ways to maximize the photoelastic coupling in gaas disk resonators , and we provide some upper bounds for its value in various geometries .
