while the emergent field of quantum thermodynamics has the potential to impact energy science , the performance of thermal machines is often classical . we ask whether quantum effects can boost the performance of a thermal machine to reach quantum supremacy , i.e. , surpassing both the efficiency and power achieved in classical thermodynamics . to this end , we introduce a nonadiabatic quantum heat engine operating an otto cycle with a many - particle working medium , consisting of an interacting bose gas confined in a time - dependent harmonic trap . it is shown that thanks to the interplay of nonadiabatic and many - particle quantum effects , this thermal machine can outperform an ensemble of single - particle heat engines with same resources , demonstrating quantum supremacy in many - particle thermal machines .
