in this paper , we study the full statistics of photons transmitted through an optical cavity coupled to nanomechanical motion . we analyze the entire temporal evolution of the photon correlations , the fano factor , and the effects of strong laser driving , all of which show pronounced features connected to the mechanical backaction . in the regime of single - photon strong coupling , this allows us to predict a transition from sub - poissonian to super - poissonian statistics for larger observation time intervals . furthermore , we predict cascades of transmitted photons triggered by multi - photon transitions . in this regime , we observe fano factors that are drastically enhanced due to the mechanical motion .
