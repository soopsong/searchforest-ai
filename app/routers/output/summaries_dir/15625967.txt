ground state cooling of massive mechanical objects remains a difficult task restricted by the unresolved mechanical sidebands . we propose an optomechanically - induced - transparency cooling scheme to achieve ground state cooling of mechanical motion without the resolved sideband condition in a pure optomechanical system with two mechanical modes coupled to the same optical cavity mode . we show that ground state cooling is achievable for sideband resolution $ \omega_{m}/\kappa$ as low as 0.003 . this provides a new route for quantum manipulation of massive macroscopic devices and high - precision measurements .
