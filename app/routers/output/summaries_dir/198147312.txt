we theoretically analyze the phase sensitivity of the induced - coherence ( mandel - type ) interferometer , including the case where the sensitivity is"boosted"into the bright input regime with coherent - light seeding . we find scaling which reaches below the shot noise limit , even when seeding the spatial mode which does not interact with the sample - or when seeding the undetected mode . it is a hybrid of a linear and a non - linear ( yurke - type ) interferometer , and aside from the super - sensitivity , is distinguished from other systems by"preferring"an imbalance in the gains of the two non - linearities ( with the second gain being optimal at low values ) , and non - monotonic behavior of the sensitivity as a function of the gain of the second non - linearity . furthermore , the setup allows use of subtracted intensity measurements , instead of direct ( additive ) or homodyne measurements - a significant practical advantage . bright , super - sensitive phase estimation of an object with different light fields for interaction and detection is possible , with various potential applications , especially in cases where the sample may be sensitive to light , or is most interesting in frequency domains outside what is easily detected , or when desiring bright - light phase estimation with sensitive / delicate detectors . we use an analysis in terms of general squeezing and discover that super - sensitivity occurs only in this case - that is , the effect is not present with the spontaneous - parametric - down - conversion approximation , which many previous analyses and experiments have focused on .
