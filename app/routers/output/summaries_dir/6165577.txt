we demonstrate efficient generation of correlated photon pairs by spontaneous four wave mixing in a 5 \mu m radius silicon ring resonator in the telecom band around 1550 nm . by optically pumping our device with a 200 \mu w continuous wave laser , we obtain a pair generation rate of 0.2 mhz and demonstrate photon time correlations with a coincidence - to - accidental ratio as high as 250 . the results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions and show the potential of silicon micro - ring resonators as room temperature sources for integrated quantum optics applications .
