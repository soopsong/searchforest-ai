we report a versatile and practical approach for generating high - quality polarization entanglement in a fully guided - wave fashion . our setup relies on a high - brilliance type-0 waveguide generator producing paired photon at a telecom wavelength associated with an advanced energy - time to polarisation transcriber . the latter is capable of creating any pure polarization entangled state , and allows manipulating single photon bandwidths that can be chosen at will over five orders of magnitude , ranging from tens of mhz to several thz . we achieve excellent entanglement fidelities for particular spectral bandwidths , i.e. 25 mhz , 540 mhz and 100 ghz , proving the relevance of our approach . our scheme stands as an ideal candidate for a wide range of network applications , ranging from dense division multiplexing quantum key distribution to heralded optical quantum memories and repeaters .
