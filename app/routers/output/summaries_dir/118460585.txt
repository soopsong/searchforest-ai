presented is a quantum lattice gas algorithm to efficiently model a system of dirac particles interacting through an intermediary gauge field . the algorithm uses a fixed qubit array to represent both the spacetime and the particles contained in the spacetime . despite being a lattice based algorithm , lorentz invariance is preserved down to the grid scale , with the continuum dirac hamiltonian generating the local unitary evolution even at that scale : there is nonlinear scaling between the smallest observable time and that time measured in the quantum field theory limit , a kind of time dilation effect that emerges on small scales but has no effect on large scales . the quantum lattice gas algorithm correctly accounts for the anticommutative braiding of indistinguishable fermions --- it does not suffer the fermi - sign problem . it provides a highly convergent numerical simulation for strongly - correlated fermions equal to a covariant path integral , presented here for the case when a dirac particle 's compton wavelength is large compared to the grid scale of the qubit array .
