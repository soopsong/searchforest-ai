testing quantum theory on macroscopic scales is a longstanding challenge that might help to revolutionise physics . for example , laboratory tests ( such as those anticipated in nanomechanical or biological systems ) may look to rule out macroscopic realism : the idea that the properties of macroscopic objects exist objectively and can be non - invasively measured . such investigations are likely to suffer from i ) stringent experimental requirements , ii ) marginal statistical significance and iii ) logical loopholes . we address all of these problems by refining two tests of macroscopic realism , or ` quantum witnesses ' , and implementing them in a microscopic test on a photonic qubit and qutrit . the first witness heralds the invasiveness of a blind measurement ; its maximum violation has been shown to grow with the dimensionality of the system under study . the second witness heralds the invasiveness of a generic quantum operation , and can achieve its maximum violation in any dimension -- it therefore allows for the highest quantum signal - to - noise ratio and most significant refutation of the classical point of view .
