recent advances in quantum information processing with trapped ions have demonstrated the need for new ion trap architectures capable of holding and manipulating chains of many ( > 10 ) ions . here we present the design and detailed characterization of a new linear trap , microfabricated with scalable complementary metal - oxide - semiconductor ( cmos ) techniques , that is well - suited to this challenge . forty - four individually controlled dc electrodes provide the many degrees of freedom required to construct anharmonic potential wells , shuttle ions , merge and split ion chains , precisely tune secular mode frequencies , and adjust the orientation of trap axes . microfabricated capacitors on dc electrodes suppress radio - frequency pickup and excess micromotion , while a top - level ground layer simplifies modeling of electric fields and protects trap structures underneath . a localized aperture in the substrate provides access to the trapping region from an oven below , permitting deterministic loading of particular isotopic / elemental sequences via species - selective photoionization . the shapes of the aperture and radio - frequency electrodes are optimized to minimize perturbation of the trapping pseudopotential . laboratory experiments verify simulated potentials and characterize trapping lifetimes , stray electric fields , and ion heating rates , while measurement and cancellation of spatially - varying stray electric fields permits the formation of nearly - equally spaced ion chains .
