we propose a novel molecular device that pumps heat against a thermal gradient . the system consists of a molecular element connecting two thermal reservoirs that are characterized by different spectral properties . the pumping action is achieved by applying an external force that periodically modulates molecular levels . this modulation affects periodic oscillations of the internal temperature of the molecule and the strength of its coupling to each reservoir resulting in a net heat flow in the desired direction . the heat flow is examined in the slow and fast modulation limits and for different modulation waveforms , thus making it possible to optimize the device performance .
