semiconductor devices are strong competitors in the race for the development of quantum computational systems . in this work , we interface two semiconductor building blocks of different dimensionality and with complementary properties : ( 1 ) a quantum dot hosting a single exciton and acting as a nearly ideal single - photon emitter and ( 2 ) a quantum well in a 2d microcavity sustaining polaritons , which are known for their strong interactions and unique hydrodynamics properties including ultrafast real - time monitoring of their propagation and phase - mapping . in the present experiment we can thus observe how the injected single - polaritons propagate and evolve inside the microcavity . in the presence of a structural defect , we observe the celebrated quantum interference of a single particle that produces fringes reminiscent of a wave propagation . our imaging of such an interference pattern , together with a measurement of antibunching , thus constitutes the first demonstration of the wave - particle duality , in space and time , for polariton fluids .
