quantum thermodynamics and quantum information are two frameworks for employing quantum mechanical systems for practical tasks , exploiting genuine quantum features to obtain advantages with respect to classical implementations . while appearing disconnected at first , the main resources of these frameworks , work and correlations , have a complicated yet interesting relationship that we examine here . we review the role of correlations in quantum thermodynamics , with a particular focus on the conversion of work into correlations . we provide new insights into the fundamental work cost of correlations and the existence of optimally correlating unitaries , and discuss relevant open problems .
