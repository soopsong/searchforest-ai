quantum machine learning witnesses an increasing amount of quantum algorithms for data - driven decision making , a problem with potential applications ranging from automated image recognition to medical diagnosis . many of those algorithms are implementations of quantum classifiers , or models for the classification of data inputs with a quantum computer . following the success of collective decision making with ensembles in classical machine learning , this paper introduces the concept of quantum ensembles of quantum classifiers . creating the ensemble corresponds to a state preparation routine , after which the quantum classifiers are evaluated in parallel and their combined decision is accessed by a single - qubit measurement . this framework naturally allows for exponentially large ensembles in which -- similar to bayesian learning -- the individual classifiers do not have to be trained . as an example , we analyse an exponentially large quantum ensemble in which each classifier is weighed according to its performance in classifying the training data , leading to new results for quantum as well as classical machine learning .
