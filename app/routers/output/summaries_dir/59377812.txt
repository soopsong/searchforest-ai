we use quantum information measures to study the local quantum phase transition that occurs for trapped spinless fermions in one - dimensional lattices . we focus on the case of a harmonic confinement . the transition occurs upon increasing the characteristic density and results in the formation of a band - insulating domain in the center of the trap . we show that the ground - state bipartite entanglement entropy can be used as an order parameter to characterize this local quantum phase transition . we also study excited eigenstates by calculating the average von neumann and second renyi eigenstate entanglement entropies , and compare the results with the thermodynamic entropy and the mutual information of thermal states at the same energy density . while at low temperatures we observe a linear increase of the thermodynamic entropy with temperature at all characteristic densities , the average eigenstate entanglement entropies exhibit a strikingly different behavior as functions of temperature below and above the transition . they are linear in temperature below the transition but exhibit activated behavior above it . hence , at nonvanishing energy densities above the ground state , the average eigenstate entanglement entropies carry fingerprints of the local quantum phase transition .
