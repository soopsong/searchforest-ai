one of the outstanding challenges for ion trap quantum information processing is to accurately detect the states of many ions in a scalable fashion . in the particular case of surface traps , geometric constraints make imaging perpendicular to the surface appealing for light collection at multiple locations with minimal cross - talk . in this report we describe an experiment integrating diffractive optic elements ( doe 's ) with surface electrode traps , connected through in - vacuum multi - mode fibers . the square doe 's reported here were all designed with solid angle collection efficiencies of 3.58 % ; with all losses included a detection efficiency of 0.388 % ( 1.02 % excluding the pmt loss ) was measured with a single ca+ ion . the presence of the doe had minimal effect on the stability of the ion , both in temporal variation of stray electric fields and in motional heating rates .
