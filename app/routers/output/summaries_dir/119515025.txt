in this paper , we study the ornstein - uhlenbeck bridge process ( i.e. the ornstein - uhlenbeck process conditioned to start and end at fixed points ) constraints to have a fixed area under its path . we present both anticipative ( in this case , we need the knowledge of the future of the path ) and non - anticipative versions of the stochastic process . we obtain the anticipative description thanks to the theory of generalized gaussian bridges while the non - anticipative representation comes from the theory of stochastic control . for this last representation , a stochastic differential equation is derived which leads to an effective langevin equation . finally , we extend our theoretical findings to linear bridge processes .
