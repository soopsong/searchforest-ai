the application of the theory of open quantum systems in biological processes such as photosynthetic complexes , has recently received renewed attention . in this paper , a quantum algorithm is presented for simulation of arbitrary markovian dynamics of the fmo complex exist in photosynthesis using a ' universal set ' of one - parameter semigroup of generators . we investigate the detailed constitution of each generator that obtain from spectral decomposition of the gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan ( gks ) matrix by using of linear combination and unitary conjugation . also , we design a quantum circuit for implementing of these generators .
