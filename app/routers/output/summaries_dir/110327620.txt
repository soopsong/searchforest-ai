quantum key distribution ( qkd ) has the potential to improve communications security by offering cryptographic keys whose security relies on the fundamental properties of quantum physics . the use of a trusted quantum receiver on an orbiting satellite is the most practical near - term solution to the challenge of achieving long - distance ( global - scale ) qkd , currently limited to a few hundred kilometers on the ground . this scenario presents unique challenges , such as high photon losses and restricted classical data transmission and processing power due to the limitations of a typical satellite platform . here we demonstrate the feasibility of such a system by implementing a qkd protocol , with optical transmission and full post - processing , in the high - loss regime using minimized computing hardware at the receiver . employing weak coherent pulses with decoy states , we demonstrate the production of secure key bits at up to 56.5 db of photon loss . we further illustrate the feasibility of a satellite uplink by generating secure key while experimentally emulating the varying channel losses predicted for realistic low - earth - orbit satellite passes at 600 km altitude . with a 76 mhz source and including finite - size analysis , we extract 3374 bits of secure key from the best pass . we also illustrate the potential benefit of combining multiple passes together : while one suboptimal"upper - quartile"pass produces no finite - sized key with our source , the combination of three such passes allows us to extract 165 bits of secure key . alternatively , we find that by increasing the signal rate to 300 mhz it would be possible to extract 21570 bits of secure finite - sized key in just a single upper - quartile pass .
