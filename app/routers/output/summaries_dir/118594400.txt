as the current revolution in communication is underway , quantum teleportation can increase the level of security in quantum communication applications . in this paper , we present a quantum teleportation procedure that capable to teleport either accelerated or non - accelerated information through different quantum channels . these quantum chan- nels are based on accelerated multi - qubit states , where each qubit of each of these channels represent a partner . namely , these states are the the w state , greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state , and the ghz - like state . here , we show that the fidelity of teleporting acceler- ated information is higher than the fidelity of teleporting non - accelerated information , both through a quantum channel that is based on accelerated state . also , the comparison among the performance of these three channels shows that the degree of fidelity depends on type of the used channel , type of the measurement , and value of the acceleration . the result of comparison concludes that teleporting information through channel that is based on the ghz state is more robust than teleporting information through channels that are based on the other two states . for future work , the proposed procedure can be generalized later to achieve communication through a wider quantum network .
