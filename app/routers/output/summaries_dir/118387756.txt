sources of entangled photon pairs are a key component in both fundamental tests of quantum theory and practical applications such as quantum key distribution and quantum computing . in this work , we describe and characterize a source of polarization entangled photon pairs based on two spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) crystals in a sagnac interferometer . our source is compact and produces high - quality entangled states in a very flexible manner . the wavelengths of the photon pairs , around 810 and 1550 nm , the phase between orthogonal components of the entangled state , and the tangle of the state are all independently adjustable . in addition to presenting basic characterization data , we present experimental violations of chsh and leggett inequalities , as well as an instance of the"beautiful"bell inequality , which has not previously been tested experimentally .
