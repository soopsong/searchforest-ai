it is known that black hole charge vectors of n=8 and magic n=2 supergravity in four and five dimensions can be represented as elements of jordan algebras of degree three over the octonions and split - octonions and their freudenthal triple systems . we show both such jordan algebras are contained in the exceptional jordan c*-algebra and construct its corresponding freudenthal triple system and single variable extension . the transformation groups for these structures give rise to the complex forms of the u - duality groups for n=8 and magic n=2 supergravities in three , four and five dimensions .
