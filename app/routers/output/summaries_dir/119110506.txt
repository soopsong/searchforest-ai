we study the influence of the fluctuations of a lorentz invariant and conserved vacuum on cosmological metric perturbations , and show that they generically blow up in the ir . we compute this effect using the k\"all\'en - lehmann spectral representation of stress correlators in generic quantum field theories , as well as the holographic bound on their entanglement entropy , both leading to an ir cut - off that scales as the fifth power of the highest uv scale ( in planck units ) . one may view this as analogous to the heisenberg uncertainty principle , which is imposed on the phase space of gravitational theories by the einstein constraint equations . the leading effect on cosmological observables come from anisotropic vacuum stresses which imply : i ) any extension of the standard model of particle physics can only have masses ( or resonances ) $ \lesssim$ 24 tev , and ii ) perturbative quantum field theory or quantum gravity becomes strongly coupled beyond a cut - off scale of $ \lambda\lesssim1 $ pev . such a low cut - off is independently motivated by the higgs hierarchy problem . this result , which we dub the cosmological non - constant problem , can be viewed as an extension of the cosmological constant ( cc ) problem , demonstrating the non - trivial uv - ir coupling and ( yet another ) limitation of effective field theory in gravity . however , it is more severe than the old cc problem , as vacuum fluctuations can not be tuned to cancel due to the positivity of spectral densities or entropy . we thus predict that future advances in cosmological observations and collider technology will sandwich from above and below , and eventually discover , new ( non - perturbative ) physics beyond the standard model within the tev - pev energy range .
