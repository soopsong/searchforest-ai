many important properties of quantum channels are quantified by means of entropic functionals . characteristics of such a kind are closely related to different representations of a quantum channel . in the jamio{\l}kowski - choi representation , the given quantum channel is described by the so - called dynamical matrix . entropies of the rescaled dynamical matrix known as map entropies describe a degree of introduced decoherence . within the so - called natural representation , the quantum channel is formally posed by another matrix obtained as reshuffling of the dynamical matrix . the corresponding entropies characterize an amount , with which the receiver a priori knows the channel output . as was previously shown , the map and receiver entropies are mutually complementary characteristics . indeed , there exists a non - trivial lower bound on their sum . first , we extend the concept of receiver entropy to the family of unified entropies . developing the previous results , we further derive non - trivial lower bounds on the sum of the map and receiver $ ( q , s)$-entropies . the derivation is essentially based on some inequalities with the schatten norms and anti - norms .
