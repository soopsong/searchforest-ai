in the current work we address the problem of quantum process tomography ( qpt ) in the case of imperfect preparation and measurement of the states which are used for qpt . the fuzzy measurements approach which helps us to efficiently take these imperfections into account is considered . however , to implement such a procedure one should have a detailed information about the errors . an approach for obtaining the partial information about them is proposed . it is based on the tomography of the ideal identity gate . this gate could be implemented by performing the measurement right after the initial state preparation . by using the result of the identity gate tomography we were able to significantly improve further qpt procedures . the proposed approach has been tested experimentally on the ibm superconducting quantum processor . as a result , we have obtained an increase in fidelity from 89 % to 98 % for hadamard transformation and from 77 % to 95 % for cnot gate .
