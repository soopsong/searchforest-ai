in arxiv:1705.10172 it was proposed that string theory replaces schwarzschild black holes with horizonless thin shells with an ads interior . in this paper we extend the analysis to slowly rotating black holes , solving the israel - lanczos - sen junction conditions for a rotating shell composed of stringy matter to determine the metric . outside of the shell we find a vacuum solution that differs from kerr with a 32 % larger quadrupole moment . we discuss the observational consequences and explore the possibility to distinguish between a black shell and a black hole . promising methods include imaging of the black hole at the center of the milky way using the event horizon telescope , precision measurements of stars in close orbits around the central black hole , and future observations of colliding super massive black holes using the space based gravitational wave observatory lisa .
