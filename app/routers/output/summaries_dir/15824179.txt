in this paper we study robust pulse design for electron shuttling in solid state devices . this is crucial for many practical applications of coherent quantum mechanical systems . our objective is to design control pulses that can transport an electron along a chain of donors , and also make this process robust to parameter uncertainties . we formulate it as a set of optimal control problems on the special unitary group su(n ) , and derive explicit expressions for the gradients of the aggregate transfer fidelity . numerical results for a donor chain of ionized phosphorus atoms in bulk silicon demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm .
