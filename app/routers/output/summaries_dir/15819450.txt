quantum information science addresses how the processing and transmission of information are affected by uniquely quantum mechanical phenomena . combination of two - qubit gates has been used to realize quantum circuits , however , scalability is becoming a critical problem . the use of three - qubit gates may simplify the structure of quantum circuits dramatically . among them , the controlled - swap ( fredkin ) gates are essential since they can be directly applied to important protocols , e.g. , error correction , fingerprinting , and optimal cloning . here we report a realization of the fredkin gate for photonic qubits . we achieve a fidelity of 0.85 in the computational basis and an output state fidelity of 0.81 for a 3-photon greenberger - horne - zeilinger state . the estimated process fidelity of 0.77 indicates that our fredkin gate can be applied to various quantum tasks .
