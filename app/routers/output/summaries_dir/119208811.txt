a tapered optical nanofiber simultaneously used to trap and optically interface of cold atoms through evanescent fields constitutes a new and well controllable hybrid quantum system . the atoms are trapped in two parallel 1d optical lattices generated by suitable far blue and red detuned evanescent field modes very close to opposite sides of the nanofiber surface . collective electronic excitations ( excitons ) of each of the optical lattices are resonantly coupled to the second lattice forming symmetric and antisymmetric common excitons . in contrast to the inverse cube dependence of the individual atomic dipole - dipole interaction , we analytically find an exponentially decaying coupling strength with distance between the lattices . the resulting symmetric ( bright ) excitons strongly interact with the resonant nanofiber photons to form fiber polaritons , which can be observed through linear optical spectra . for large enough wave vectors the polariton decay rate to free space is strongly reduced , which should render this system ideal for the realization of long range quantum communication between atomic ensembles .
