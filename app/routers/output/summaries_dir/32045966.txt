the mathematically sound theory of quantum open systems , formulated in the 70-ties of xx century and highlighted by the discovery of gorini - kossakowski - lindblad - sudarshan ( gkls ) equation , found a wide range of applications in various branches of physics and chemistry , notably in the field of quantum information and quantum thermodynamics . however , it took 40 years before this formalism has been applied to explain correctly the operation principles of long existing energy transducers like photovoltaic , thermoelectric and fuel cells . this long path is briefly reviewed from the personal author 's perspective . finally , the new , fully quantum model of chemical engine based on gkls equation and applicable to fuel cells or replicators is outlined . the model illustrates the difficulty with an entirely quantum operational definition of work , comparable to the problem of quantum measurement .
