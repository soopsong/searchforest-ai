we present and analyze a hybrid quantum system that interfaces a majorana - hosted semiconductor nanowire with a single nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center via a magnetized torsional cantilever . we show that , the torsional mode of the mechanical resonator can strongly couple to the majorana qubit and the spin qubit simultaneously , which allows to interface them for quantum state conversion through a dark state protocol . this work provides a promising interface between the topological qubit and the conventional spin qubit , and can find interesting applications in quantum information and computation .
