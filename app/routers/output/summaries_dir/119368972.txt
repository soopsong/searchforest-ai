transport of bose - einstein condensates in magnetic microtraps , controllable by external parameters such as wire currents or radio - frequency fields , is studied within the framework of optimal control theory ( oct ) . we derive from the gross - pitaevskii equation the optimality system for the oct fields that allow to efficiently channel the condensate between given initial and desired states . for a variety of magnetic confinement potentials we study transport and wavefunction splitting of the condensate , and demonstrate that oct allows to drastically outperfrom more simple schemes for the time variation of the microtrap control parameters .
