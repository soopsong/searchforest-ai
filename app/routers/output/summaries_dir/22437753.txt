we present an experimental demonstration of the hamiltonian manipulation in light - atom interface in raman - type warm rubidium-87 vapor atomic memory . by adjusting the detuning of the driving beam we varied the relative contributions of the stokes and anti - stokes scattering to the process of four - wave mixing which reads out a spatially multimode state of atomic memory . we measured the temporal evolution of the readout fields and the spatial intensity correlations between write - in and readout as a function of detuning with the use of an intensified camera . the correlation maps enabled us to resolve between the anti - stokes and the stokes scattering and to quantify their contributions . our experimental results agree quantitatively with a simple , plane - wave theoretical model we provide . they allow for a simple interpretation of the coaction of the anti - stokes and the stokes scattering at the readout stage . the stokes contribution yields additional , adjustable gain at the readout stage , albeit with inevitable extra noise . here we provide a simple and useful framework to trace it , which is significant to the existing atomic memories setups . furthermore , the shown hamiltonian manipulation offers a broad range of atom - light interfaces readily applicable in current and future quantum protocols with atomic ensembles .
