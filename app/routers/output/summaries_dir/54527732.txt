the classical three - box paradox of kirkpatrick [ j. phys . a 36 4891 ( 2003 ) ] is compared to the original quantum three - box paradox of aharonov and vaidman [ j. phys . a 24 2315 ( 1991 ) ] . it is argued that the quantum three - box experiment is a"quantum paradox"in the sense that it is an example of a classical task which can not be accomplished using classical means , but can be accomplished using quantum devices . it is shown that kirkpatrick 's card game is analogous to a different game with a particle in three boxes which does not contain paradoxical features .
