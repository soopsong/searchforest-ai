cavity array metamaterials ( cams ) , composed of optical microcavities in a lattice coupled via tight - binding interactions , represent a novel architecture for engineering metamaterials . since the size of the cams ' constituent elements are commensurate with the operating wavelength of the device , it can not directly utilise classical transformation optics in the same way as traditional metamaterials . by directly transforming the internal geometry of the system , and locally tuning the permittivity between cavities , we provide an alternative framework suitable for tight - binding implementations of metamaterials . we develop a cam - based cloak as the case study .
