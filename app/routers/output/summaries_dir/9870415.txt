we experimentally investigate the interaction between one and two atoms and the field of a high - finesse optical resonator . laser - cooled caesium atoms are transported into the cavity using an optical dipole trap . we monitor the interaction dynamics of a single atom strongly coupled to the resonator mode for several hundred milliseconds by observing the cavity transmission . moreover , we investigate the position - dependent coupling of one and two atoms by shuttling them through the cavity mode . we demonstrate an alternative method , which suppresses heating effects , to analyze the atom - field interaction by retrieving the atom from the cavity and by measuring its final state .
