frustration of classical many - body systems can be used to distinguish ferromagnetic interactions from anti - ferromagnetic ones via the toulouse conditions . a quantum version of the toulouse conditions provides a similar classification based on the local ground states . we compute the global ground states for a family of models with heisenberg - like interactions and analyse their behaviour with respect to frustration , entanglement and degeneracy . for that we develop analytical and numerical analysing tools capable to quantify the interplay between those three quantities . we find that the quantum toulouse conditions provide a proper classification , however , refinements can be found . our results show how the different local ground states affect the interplay and pave the way for further generalisation and possible applications to other quantum many - body systems .
