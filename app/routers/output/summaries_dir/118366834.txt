important properties of a quantum system are not directly measurable , but they can be disclosed by how fast the system changes under controlled perturbations . in particular , asymmetry and entanglement can be verified by reconstructing the state of a quantum system . yet , this usually requires experimental and computational resources which increase exponentially with the system size . here we show how to detect metrologically useful asymmetry and entanglement by a limited number of measurements . this is achieved by studying how they affect the speed of evolution of a system under a unitary transformation . we show that the speed of multiqubit systems can be evaluated by measuring a set of local observables , providing exponential advantage with respect to state tomography . indeed , the presented method requires neither the knowledge of the state and the parameter - encoding hamiltonian nor global measurements performed on all the constituent subsystems . we implement the detection scheme in an all - optical experiment .
