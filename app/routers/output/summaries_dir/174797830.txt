resonance fluorescence , consisting of light emission from an atom driven by a classical oscillating field , is well - known to yield a sub - poissonian photon counting statistics . this occurs when only emitted light is detected , which corresponds to a master equation ( me ) unraveling in terms of the canonical jump operator describing spontaneous decay . formally , an alternative me unraveling is possible in terms of a shifted jump operator . we show that this shift can result in sub - poissonian , poissonian or super - poissonian quantum jump statistics . this is shown in terms of the mandel q parameter in the limit of long counting times , which is computed through large deviation theory . we present a waveguide - qed setup , comprising a chiral waveguide coupled to a driven atom , where photon counting is described by the considered class of shifted jump operators .
