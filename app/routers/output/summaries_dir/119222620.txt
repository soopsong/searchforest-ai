the holographic entanglement of purification ( eop ) in ads$_{4}$ and ads - rn black hole backgrounds is studied . we develop an algorithm to compute the eop for bipartite configuration with infinitely long strips . the temperature behavior of eop is revealed for small , intermediate and large configurations : eop monotonically increases with the temperature for small configurations ; while for intermediate configurations , eop is configuration - dependent ; eop vanishes for large configurations . our numerical results verify some important inequalities of eop , which we also prove geometrically in poincar\'e coordinate .
