a parameterization of the density operator , a coherence vector representation , which uses a basis of orthogonal , traceless , hermitian matrices is discussed . using this parameterization we find the region of permissible vectors which represent a density operator . the inequalities which specify the region are shown to involve the casimir invariants of the group . in particular cases , this allows the determination of degeneracies in the spectrum of the operator . the identification of the casimir invariants also provides a method of constructing quantities which are invariant under { \it local } unitary operations . several examples are given which illustrate the constraints provided by the positivity requirements and the utility of the coherence vector parameterization .
