communication over proven - secure quantum channels is potentially one of the most wide - ranging applications of currently developed quantum technologies . it is generally envisioned that in future quantum networks , separated nodes containing stationary solid - state or atomic qubits are connected via the exchange of optical photons over large distances . in this work we explore an intriguing alternative for quantum communication via all - microwave networks . to make this possible , we describe a general protocol for sending quantum states through thermal channels , even when the number of thermal photons in the channel is much larger than one . the protocol can be implemented with state - of - the - art superconducting circuits and enables the transfer of quantum states over distances of ~100 m via microwave transmission lines cooled to only t=4k . this opens up completely new possibilities for quantum communication within and across buildings , and consequently , for the implementation of intra - city quantum networks based on microwave technology only .
