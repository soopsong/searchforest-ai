in contrast to the fully projective limit of strong quantum measurement , where the evolution is locked to a small subspace ( quantum zeno dynamics ) , or even frozen completely ( quantum zeno effect ) , the weak non - projective measurement can effectively compete with standard unitary dynamics leading to nontrivial effects . here we consider global weak measurement addressing collective variables , thus preserving quantum superpositions due to the lack of which path information . while for certainty we focus on ultracold atoms , the idea can be generalized to other multimode quantum systems , including various quantum emitters , optomechanical arrays , and purely photonic systems with multiple - path interferometers ( photonic circuits ) . we show that light scattering from ultracold bosons in optical lattices can be used for defining macroscopically occupied spatial modes that exhibit long - range coherent dynamics . even if the measurement strength remains constant , the quantum measurement backaction acts on the atomic ensemble quasi - periodically and induces collective oscillatory dynamics of all the atoms . we introduce an effective model for the evolution of the spatial modes and present an analytic solution showing that the quantum jumps drive the system away from its stable point . we confirm our finding describing the atomic observables in terms of stochastic differential equations .
