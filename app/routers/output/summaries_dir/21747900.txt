the one - particle density matrix of the one - dimensional tonks - girardeau gas with inhomogeneous density profile is calculated , thanks to a recent observation that relates this system to a two - dimensional conformal field theory in curved space . the result is asymptotically exact in the limit of large particle density and small density variation , and holds for arbitrary trapping potentials . in the particular case of a harmonic trap , we recover a formula obtained by forrester et al . [ phys . rev . a 67 , 043607 ( 2003 ) ] from a different method .
