a many - body atomic system coupled to quantized light is subject to weak measurement . instead of coupling light to the on - site density , we consider the quantum backaction due to the measurement of matter - phase - related variables such as global phase coherence . we show how this unconventional approach opens up new opportunities to affect system evolution and demonstrate how this can lead to a new class of measurement projections , thus extending the measurement postulate for the case of strong competition with the system 's own evolution .
