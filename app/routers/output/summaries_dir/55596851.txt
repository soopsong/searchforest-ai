quantum chaos in many - body systems may be characterized by the lyapunov exponent defined as the exponential growth rate of out - of - time - order correlators ( otoc ) . so far lyaponov exponents around various quantum critical points ( qcp ) remain largely unexplored . here , we investigate the lyapunov exponent around qcps of the gross - neveu ( gn ) model with $ n$ flavors of dirac fermions in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions . around the gn quantum phase transition between a dirac semimetal and a gapped insulator breaking $ z_2 $ symmetry ( e.g. , inversion symmetry of the honeycomb lattice ) , we find that the lyaponov exponent $ \lambda_l \approx 3.5 t / n$ at temperature $ t$ and to the leading order of $ 1 / n$ in the large-$n$ expansion . we also obtain the quantum scattering rate of an excitation with energy $ \epsilon$ , which is proportional to $ \sqrt{\epsilon t}/n$ at low energy . we further discuss possible experimental relevances of the gn model in many - body systems .
