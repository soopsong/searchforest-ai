we present a comprehensive theory and an easy to follow method for the design and construction of a wideband homodyne detector for time - domain quantum measurements . we show how one can evaluate the performance of a detector in a specific time - domain experiment based on electronic spectral characteristic of that detector . we then present and characterize a high - performance detector constructed using inexpensive , commercially available components such as low - noise high - speed operational amplifiers and high - bandwidth photodiodes . our detector shows linear behavior up to a level of over 13 db clearance between shot noise and electronic noise , in the range from dc to 100 mhz . the detector can be used for measuring quantum optical field quadratures both in the continuous - wave and pulsed regimes with pulse repetition rates up to about 250 mhz .
