ever since the inception of gravitational - wave detectors , limits imposed by quantum mechanics to the detection of time - varying signals have been a subject of intense research and debate . drawing insights from quantum information theory , quantum detection theory , and quantum measurement theory , here we prove lower error bounds for waveform detection via a quantum system , settling the long - standing problem . in the case of optomechanical force detection , we derive analytic expressions for the bounds in some cases of interest and discuss how the limits can be approached using quantum control techniques .
