we construct a self - consistent model which describes a black hole from formation to evaporation including the back reaction from the hawking radiation . in the case where a null shell collapses , at the beginning the evaporation occurs , but it stops eventually , and a horizon and singularity appear . on the other hand , in the generic collapse process of a continuously distributed null matter , the black hole evaporates completely without forming a macroscopically large horizon nor singularity . we also find a stationary solution in the heat bath , which can be regarded as a normal thermodynamic object .
