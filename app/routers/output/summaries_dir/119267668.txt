we extend the non - hermitian one - dimensional quantum walk model [ phys . rev . lett . 102 , 065703 ( 2009 ) ] by taking the dephasing effect into account . we prove that the feature of topological transition does not change even when dephasing between the sites within units is present . the potential experimental observation of our theoretical results in the circuit qed system consisting of superconducting qubit coupled to a superconducting resonator mode is discussed and numerically simulated . the results clearly show a topological transition in quantum walk and display the robustness of such a system to the decay and dephasing of qubits . we also discuss how to extend this model to higher dimension in the circuit qed system .
