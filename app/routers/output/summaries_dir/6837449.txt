there exist numerous proofs of bell 's theorem , stating that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local realistic theories of nature . here we define the strength of such nonlocality proofs in terms of the amount of evidence against local realism provided by the corresponding experiments . this measure tells us how many trials of the experiment we should perform in order to observe a substantial violation of local realism . statistical considerations show that the amount of evidence should be measured by the kullback - leibler or relative entropy divergence between the probability distributions over the measurement outcomes that the respective theories predict . the statistical strength of a nonlocality proof is thus determined by the experimental implementation of it that maximizes the kullback - leibler divergence from experimental ( quantum mechanical ) truth to the set of all possible local theories . an implementation includes a specification with which probabilities the different measurement settings are sampled , and hence the maximization is done over all such setting distributions . we analyze two versions of bell 's nonlocality proof ( his original proof and an optimized version by peres ) , and proofs by clauser - horne - shimony - holt , hardy , mermin , and greenberger - horne - zeilinger . we find that the ghz proof is at least four and a half times stronger than all other proofs , while of the two - party proofs , the one of chsh is the strongest .
