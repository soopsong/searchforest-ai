we test hardy 's paradox of non - locality experimentally on the ibm five - qubit quantum computer for the first time . the quantum circuit is constructed on superconducting qubits corresponding to the original hardy 's test of non - locality . results confirmed the theory that any non - maximally entangled state of two qubits violates hardy 's equations , whereas any maximally entangled state and product state of two qubits do not exhibit hardy 's non - locality . we also point out the difficulties associated with the practical implementation of any hardy 's paradox based quantum protocol and propose three performance measures for any two qubits of any quantum computer .
