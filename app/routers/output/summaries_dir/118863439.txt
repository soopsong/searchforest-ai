the dynamics of the quantum rabi model in the deep strong coupling regime is theoretically analyzed in a trapped - ion setup . recognizably , the main hallmark of this regime is the emergence of collapses and revivals , whose faithful observation is hindered under realistic magnetic dephasing noise . here we discuss how to attain a faithful implementation of the quantum rabi model in the deep strong coupling regime which is robust against magnetic field fluctuations and at the same time provides a large tunability of the simulated parameters . this is achieved by combining standing wave laser configuration with continuous dynamical decoupling . in addition , we study the role that amplitude fluctuations play to correctly attain the quantum rabi model using the proposed method . in this manner the present work further supports the suitability of continuous dynamical decoupling techniques in trapped - ion settings to faithfully realize different interacting dynamics .
