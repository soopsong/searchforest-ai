the objective of this article is to introduce the tools to analyze the contrast imaging problem in nuclear magnetic resonance . optimal trajectories can be selected among extremal solutions of the pontryagin maximum principle applied to this mayer type optimal problem . such trajectories are associated to the question of extremizing the transfer time . hence the optimal problem is reduced to the analysis of the hamiltonian dynamics related to singular extremals and their optimality status . this is illustrated by using the examples of cerebrospinal fluid / water and grey / white matter of cerebrum .
