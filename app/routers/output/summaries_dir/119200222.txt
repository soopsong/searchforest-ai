integrated optics provides an ideal test bed for the emulation of quantum systems via continuous - time quantum walks . here we study the evolution of two - photon states in an elliptic array of waveguides . we characterise the photonic chip via coherent - light tomography and use the results to predict distinct differences between temporally indistinguishable and distinguishable two - photon inputs which we then compare with experimental observations . our work highlights the feasibility for emulation of coherent quantum phenomena in three - dimensional waveguide structures .
