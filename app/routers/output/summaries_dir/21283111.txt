we present a narrow linewidth continuous laser source with over 11 watts of output power at 780 nm , based on single - pass frequency doubling of an amplified 1560 nm fibre laser with 36 % efficiency . this source offers a combination of high power , simplicity , mode quality and stability . without any active stabilization , the linewidth is measured to be below 10khz . the fibre seed is tunable over 60ghz , which allows access to the d2 transitions in 87rb and 85rb , providing a viable high - power source for laser cooling as well as for large - momentum - transfer beamsplitters in atom interferometry . sources of this type will pave the way for a new generation of high flux , high duty - cycle degenerate quantum gas experiments .
