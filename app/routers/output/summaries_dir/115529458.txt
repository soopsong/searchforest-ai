multiphoton entanglement is an important resource for linear optics quantum computing . here we show that a wide range of highly entangled multiphoton states , including w - states , can be prepared by interfering single photons inside a bell multiport beam splitter and using postselection . a successful state preparation is indicated by the collection of one photon per output port . an advantage of the bell multiport beam splitter is that it redirects the photons without changing their inner degrees of freedom . the described setup can therefore be used to generate polarisation , time - bin and frequency multiphoton entanglement , even when using only a single photon source .
