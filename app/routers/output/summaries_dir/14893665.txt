we present a general method for constructing pure - product - state representations for density operators of $ n$ quantum bits . if such a representation has nonnegative expansion coefficients , it provides an explicit separable ensemble for the density operator . we derive the condition for separability of a mixture of the greenberger - horne - zeilinger state with the maximally mixed state .
