in this work , the effects of non - commutative and commutative vacua on the phase space generated by a scalar field in a scalar torsion scenario are investigated . for both classical and quantum regimes , the commutative and non - commutative cases are compared . to take account the effects of non - commutativity , two well known non - commutative parameters , $ \theta$ and $ \beta,$ are introduced . it should be emphasized , the effects of $ \beta$ which is related to momentum sector has more key role in comparison to $ \theta$ which is related to space sector . also the different boundary conditions and mathematical interpretations of non - commutativity are explored .
