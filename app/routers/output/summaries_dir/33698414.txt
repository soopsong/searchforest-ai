the theoretical description of quantum dynamics in an intriguing way does not necessarily imply the underlying dynamics is indeed intriguing . here we show how a known very interesting master equation with an always negative decay rate [ eternal non - markovianity ( enm ) ] arises from simple stochastic schr\"odinger dynamics ( random unitary dynamics ) . equivalently , it may be seen as arising from a mixture of markov ( semi - group ) open system dynamics . both these approaches lead to a more general family of cpt maps , characterized by a point within a parameter triangle . our results show how enm quantum dynamics can be realised easily in the laboratory . moreover , we find a quantum time - continuously measured ( quantum trajectory ) realisation of the dynamics of the enm master equation based on unitary transformations and projective measurements in an extended hilbert space , guided by a classical markov process . furthermore , a gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan - lindblad ( gksl ) representation of the dynamics in an extended hilbert space can be found , with a remarkable property : there is no dynamics in the ancilla state . finally , analogous constructions for two qubits extend these results from non - cp - divisible to non - p - divisible dynamics .
