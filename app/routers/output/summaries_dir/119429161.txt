quantum optomechanics opens a possibility to mediate a physical connection of quantum optics and classical thermodynamics . we propose and theoretically analyze a one - way chain starting from various quantum states of radiation . in the chain , the radiation state is first ideally swapped to sufficiently large mechanical oscillator ( membrane ) . then the membrane mechanically pushes a classical almost mass - less piston , which is pressing a gas in a small container . as a result we observe strongly nonlinear and nonmonotonic transfer of the energy stored in classical and quantum uncertainty of radiation to mechanical work . the amount of work and even its sign depends strongly on the uncertainty of the radiation state . our theoretical prediction would stimulate an experimental proposals for such optomechanical connection to thermodynamics .
