we theoretically introduce a new kind of non - gaussian state-----laguerre polynomial excited coherent states by using the multiphoton catalysis which actually can be considered as a block comprising photon number operator . it is found that the normalized factor is related to the two - variable hermite polynomials . we then investigate the nonclassical properties in terms of mandel 's q parameter , quadrature squeezing , second correlation , and the negativity of wigner function ( wf ) . it is shown that all these properties are related to the amplitude of coherent state , catalysis number and unbalanced beam splitter ( bs ) . in particular , the maximum degree of squeezing can be enhanced as catalysis number and keeps a constant for single - photon catalysis . in addition , we examine the effect of decoherence by wigner function , which show that the negative region , characteristic time of decoherence and structure of wf are affected by catalysis number and unbalanced bs . our work provides a general analysis about how to prepare theoretically polynomials quantum states .
