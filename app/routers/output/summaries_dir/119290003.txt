symmetries play a crucial role in physics and , in particular , the noether symmetries are a useful tool both to select models motivated at a fundamental level , and to find exact solutions for specific lagrangians . in this work , we consider the application of point symmetries in the recently proposed metric - palatini hybrid gravity in order to select the $ f({\cal r})$ functional form and to find analytical solutions for the field equations and for the related wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation . we show that , in order to find out integrable $ f({\cal r})$ models , conformal transformations in the lagrangians are extremely useful . in this context , we explore two conformal transformations of the forms $ d\tau = n(a ) dt$ and $ d\tau = n(\phi ) dt$. for the former conformal transformation , we found two cases of $ f({\cal r})$ functions where the field equations admit noether symmetries . in the second case , the lagrangian reduces to a brans - dicke - like theory with a general coupling function . for each case , it is possible to transform the field equations by using normal coordinates to simplify the dynamical system and to obtain exact solutions . furthermore , we perform quantization and derive the wdw equation for the minisuperspace model . the lie point symmetries for the wdw equation are determined and used to find invariant solutions .
