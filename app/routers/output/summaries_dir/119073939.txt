we consider low rank density operators $ \varrho$ supported on a $ m\times n$ hilbert space for arbitrary $ m$ and $ n$ ( $ m\leq n$ ) and with a positive partial transpose ( ppt ) $ \varrho^{t_a}\ge 0$. for rank $ r(\varrho ) \leq n$ we prove that having a ppt is necessary and sufficient for $ \varrho$ to be separable ; in this case we also provide its minimal decomposition in terms of pure product states . it follows from this result that there is no rank 3 bound entangled states having a ppt . we also present a necessary and sufficient condition for the separability of generic density matrices for which the sum of the ranks of $ \varrho$ and $ \varrho^{t_a}$ satisfies $ r(\varrho)+r(\varrho^{t_a } ) \le 2mn - m - n+2$. this separability condition has the form of a constructive check , providing thus also a pure product state decomposition for separable states , and it works in those cases where a system of couple polynomial equations has a finite number of solutions , as expected in most cases .
