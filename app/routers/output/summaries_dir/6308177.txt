w state is a key resource in quantum communication . fusion technology has been proven to be a good candidate for preparing a large - size w state from two or more small - size w states in linear optical system . it is of great importance to study how to fuse w states via light - matter interface . here we show that it is possible to prepare large - size w - state networks using a fusion mechanism in cavity qed system . the detuned interaction between three atoms and a vacuum cavity mode constitute the main fusion mechanism , based on which two or three small - size atomic w states can be fused into a larger - size w state . if no excitation is detected from those three atoms , the remaining atoms are still in the product of two or three new w states , which can be re - fused . the complicated fredkin gate used in the previous fusion schemes is avoided here . w states of size 2 can be fused as well . the feasibility analysis shows that our fusion processes maybe implementable with the current technology . our results demonstrate how the light - matter interaction based fusion mechanism can be realized , and may become the starting point for the fusion of multipartite entanglement in cavity qed system .
