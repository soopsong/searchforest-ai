in this article we explore a modification in the problem of controlling the rotation of a two level quantum system from an initial state to a final state in minimum time . specifically we consider the case where the qubit is being weakly monitored -- albeit with an assumption that both the measurement strength as well as the angular velocity are assumed to be control signals . this modification alters the dynamics significantly and enables the exploitation of the measurement backaction to assist in achieving the control objective . the proposed method yields a significant speedup in achieving the desired state transfer compared to previous approaches . these results are demonstrated via numerical solutions for an example problem on a single qubit .
