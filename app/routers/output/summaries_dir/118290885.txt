we describe the generation of atom - resonant indistinguishable photon pairs using nonlinear optical techniques , their spectral purification using atomic filters , characterization using multi - photon interference , and application to quantum - enhanced sensing with atoms . using either type - i or type - ii cavity - enhanced spontaneous parametric down - conversion , we generate pairs of photons in the resonant modes of optical cavities with linewidths comparable to the 6 mhz natural linewidth of the d$_1 $ line of atomic rubidium . the cavities and pump lasers are tuned so that emission occurs in a mode or a pair of orthogonally - polarized modes that are resonant to the d$_1 $ line , at 794.7 nm . the emission from these frequency - degenerate modes is separated from other cavity emission using ultra - narrow atomic frequency filters , either a faraday anomalous dispersion optical filter ( fadof ) with a 445mhz linewidth and 57 db of out - of - band rejection or an induced dichroism filter with an 80 mhz linewidth and $ \ge$35db out - of - band rejection . using the type - i source , we demonstrate interference of photon pair amplitudes against a coherent state and a new method for full characterization of the temporal wave - function of narrow - band photon pairs . with the type - ii source we demonstrate high - visibility super - resolving interference , a high - fidelity atom - tuned noon state , and quantum enhanced sensing of atoms using indistinguishable photon pairs .
