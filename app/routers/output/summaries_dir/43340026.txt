we consider the effect of replacing in stochastic differential equations leading to the dynamical collapse of the statevector , white noise stochastic processes with non white ones . we prove that such a modification can be consistently performed without altering the most interesting features of the previous models . one of the reasons to discuss this matter derives from the desire of being allowed to deal with physical stochastic fields , such as the gravitational one , which can not give rise to white noises . from our point of view the most relevant motivation for the approach we propose here derives from the fact that in relativistic models the occurrence of white noises is the main responsible for the appearance of untractable divergences . therefore , one can hope that resorting to non white noises one can overcome such a difficulty . we investigate stochastic equations with non white noises , we discuss their reduction properties and their physical implications . our analysis has a precise interest not only for the above mentioned subject but also for the general study of dissipative systems and decoherence .
