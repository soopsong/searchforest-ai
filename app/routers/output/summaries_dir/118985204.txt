an experimental scheme for concentrating entanglement in partially entangled photon pairs is proposed . in this scheme , two separated parties obtain one maximally entangled photon pair from previously shared two partially entangled photon pairs by local operations and classical communication . a practical realization of the proposed scheme is discussed , which uses imperfect photon detectors and spontaneous parametric down - conversion as a photon source . this scheme also works for purifying a class of mixed states .
