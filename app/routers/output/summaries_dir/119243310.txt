a big challenge in continuous variable quantum key distribution is to prove security against arbitrary coherent attacks including realistic assumptions such as finite - size effects . recently , such a proof has been presented in [ phys . rev . lett . 109 , 100502 ( 2012 ) ] for a two - mode squeezed state protocol based on a novel uncertainty relation with quantum memories . but the transmission distances were fairly limited due to a direct reconciliation protocol . we prove here security against coherent attacks of a reverse reconciliation protocol under similar assumptions but allowing distances of over 16 km for experimentally feasible parameters . we further clarify the limitations when using the uncertainty relation with quantum memories in security proofs of continuous variable quantum key distribution .
