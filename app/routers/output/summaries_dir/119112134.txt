a new method for detecting the magnetic resonance of electronic spins at low temperature is demonstrated . it consists in measuring the signal emitted by the spins with a superconducting qubit that acts as a single - microwave - photon detector , resulting in an enhanced sensitivity . we implement this new type of electron - spin resonance spectroscopy using a hybrid quantum circuit in which a transmon qubit is coupled to a spin ensemble consisting of nv centers in diamond . with this setup we measure the nv center absorption spectrum at 30mk at an excitation level of \thicksim15\,\mu_{b } out of an ensemble of 10^{11 } spins .
