we describe an approach to optical non - reciprocity that exploits the local helicity of evanescent electric fields in axisymmetric resonators . by interfacing an optical cavity to helicity - sensitive transitions , such as zeeman levels in a quantum dot , light transmission through a waveguide becomes direction - dependent when the state degeneracy is lifted . using a linearized quantum master equation , we analyze the configurations that exhibit non - reciprocity , and we show that reasonable parameters from existing cavity qed experiments are sufficient to demonstrate a coherent non - reciprocal optical isolator operating at the level of a single photon .
