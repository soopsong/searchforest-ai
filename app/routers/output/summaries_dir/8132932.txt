quantum circuits currently constitute a dominant model for quantum computation . our work addresses the problem of constructing quantum circuits to implement an arbitrary given quantum computation , in the special case of two qubits . we pursue circuits without ancilla qubits and as small a number of elementary quantum gates as possible . our lower bound for worst - case optimal two - qubit circuits calls for at least 17 gates : 15 one - qubit rotations and 2 cnots . to this end , we constructively prove a worst - case upper bound of 23 elementary gates , of which at most 4 ( cnot ) entail multi - qubit interactions . our analysis shows that synthesis algorithms suggested in previous work , although more general , entail much larger quantum circuits than ours in the special case of two qubits . one such algorithm has a worst case of 61 gates of which 18 may be cnots . our techniques rely on the kak decomposition from lie theory as well as the polar and spectral ( symmetric shur ) matrix decompositions from numerical analysis and operator theory . they are related to the canonical decomposition of a two - qubit gate with respect to the ` ` magic basis ' ' of phase - shifted bell states , published previously . we further extend this decomposition in terms of elementary gates for quantum computation .
