active work measures how far the local self - forcing of active particles translates into real motion . using population monte carlo methods , we investigate large deviations in the active work for repulsive active brownian disks . minimizing the active work generically results in dynamical arrest ; in contrast , despite the lack of aligning interactions , trajectories of high active work correspond to a collectively moving , aligned state . we use heuristic and analytic arguments to explain the origin of dynamical phase transitions separating the arrested , typical , and aligned regimes .
