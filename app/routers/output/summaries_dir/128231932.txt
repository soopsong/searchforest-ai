the extended boundary condition method can be formulated to study plane - wave scattering by an ellipsoid composed of an orthorhombic dielectric - magnetic material whose relative permittivity dyadic is a scalar multiple of its relative permeability dyadic , when the constitutive principal axes are arbitrarily oriented with respect to the shape principal axes . known vector spherical wavefunctions are used to represent the fields in the surrounding matter - free space . after deriving closed - form expressions for the vector spherical wavefunctions for the scattering material , the internal fields are represented as superpositions of those vector spherical wavefunctions . the unknown scattered - field coefficients are related to the known incident - field coefficients by a transition matrix . the total scattering and absorption efficiencies are highly affected by the orientation of the constitutive principal axes relative to the shape principal axes , and the effect of the orientational mismatch between the two sets of principal axes is more pronounced as the electrical size increases . the dependence of the total scattering efficiency , but not of the absorption efficiency , on the angle of rotation about a shape principal axis can be predicted qualitatively from the variation of a scalar function with respect to the angle of rotation . the total scattering and absorption efficiencies do not depend on the polarization state of incident plane wave when the scattering material is impedance - matched to free space . the polarization state of the incident plane wave has a more discernible effect on the total scattering and absorption efficiencies for ellipsoids compared to spheres .
