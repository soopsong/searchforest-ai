although superconducting systems provide a promising platform for quantum computing , their networking poses a challenge as they can not be interfaced to light --- the medium used to send quantum signals through channels at room temperature . we show that mechanical oscillators can mediated such coupling and light can be used to measure the joint state of two distant qubits . the measurement provides information on the total spin of the two qubits such that entangled qubit states can be postselected . entanglement generation is possible without ground - state cooling of the mechanical oscillators for systems with optomechanical cooperativity moderately larger than unity ; in addition , our setup tolerates a substantial transmission loss . the approach is scalable to generation of multipartite entanglement and represents a crucial step towards quantum networks with superconducting circuits .
