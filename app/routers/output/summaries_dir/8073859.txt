a class of squeezed states for the su(1,1 ) algebra is found and expressed by the exponential and laguerre - polynomial operators acting on the vacuum states . as a special case it is proved that the perelomov 's coherent state is a ladder - operator squeezed state and therefore a minimum uncertainty state . the theory is applied to the two - particle calogero - sutherland model . we find some new squeezed states and compared them with the classical trajectories . the connection with some su(1,1 ) quantum optical systems ( amplitude - squared realization , holstein - primakoff realization , the two mode realization and a four mode realization ) is also discussed .
