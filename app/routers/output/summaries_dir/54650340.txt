generally , the dynamics of test particles around galaxies , as well as the corresponding mass deficit , is explained by postulating the existence of a hypothetical dark matter . in fact , the behavior of the rotation curves shows the existence of a constant velocity region , near the baryonic matter distribution , followed by a quick decay at large distances . in this work , we consider the possibility that the behavior of the rotational velocities of test particles gravitating around galaxies can be explained within the framework of the recently proposed hybrid metric - palatini gravitational theory . the latter is constructed by modifying the metric einstein - hilbert action with an $ f(r)$ term in the palatini formalism . it was shown that the theory unifies local constraints and the late - time cosmic acceleration , even if the scalar field is very light . in the intermediate galactic scale , we show explicitly that in the hybrid metric - palatini model the tangential velocity can be explicitly obtained as a function of the scalar field of the equivalent scalar - tensor description . the possibility of constraining the form of the scalar field and the parameters of the model by using the stellar velocity dispersions is also analyzed . furthermore , the doppler velocity shifts are also obtained in terms of the scalar field . all the physical and geometrical quantities and the numerical parameters in the hybrid metric - palatini model can be expressed in terms of observable / measurable parameters , such as the tangential velocity , the baryonic mass of the galaxy , the doppler frequency shifts , and the stellar dispersion velocity , respectively . therefore , the obtained results open the possibility of testing the hybrid metric - palatini gravitational models at the galactic or extra - galactic scale by using direct astronomical and astrophysical observations .
