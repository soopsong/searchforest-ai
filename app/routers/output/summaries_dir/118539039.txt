we present two two - step practical entanglement concentration protocols ( ecps ) for concentrating an arbitrary three - particle less - entangled w state into a maximally entangled w state assisted with single photons . the first protocol uses the linear optics and the second protocol adopts the cross - kerr nonlinearity to perform the protocol . in the first protocol , based on the post - selection principle , three parties say alice , bob and charlie in different distant locations can obtain the maximally entangled w state from the arbitrary less - entangled w state with a certain success probability . in the second protocol , it dose not require the parties to posses the sophisticated single - photon detectors and the concentrated photon pair can be retained after performing this protocol successfully . moreover , the second protocol can be repeated to get a higher success probability . both protocols may be useful in practical quantum information applications .
