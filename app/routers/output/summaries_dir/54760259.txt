we extend the covariance - matrix description of atom -- light quantum interfaces , originally developed for real and effective spin-1/2 atoms , to include"spin alignment"degrees of freedom . this allows accurate modeling of optically - probed spin-1 ensembles in arbitrary magnetic fields . we also include technical noise terms that are very common in experimental situations . these include magnetic field noise , variable atom number and the effect of magnetic field inhomogeneities . we demonstrate the validity of our extended model by comparing numerical simulations to a free -- induction decay ( fid ) measurement of polarized $ ^{87}$rb atoms in the $ f = 1 $ ground state . we qualitatively and quantitatively reproduce experimental results with all free parameters of the simulations fixed . the model can be easily extended to larger spin systems , and adapted to more complicated experimental situations .
