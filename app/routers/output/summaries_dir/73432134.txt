the basic idea of quantum computing is surprisingly similar to that of kernel methods in machine learning , namely to efficiently perform computations in an intractably large hilbert space . in this paper we explore some theoretical foundations of this link and show how it opens up a new avenue for the design of quantum machine learning algorithms . we interpret the process of encoding inputs in a quantum state as a nonlinear feature map that maps data to quantum hilbert space . a quantum computer can now analyse the input data in this feature space . based on this link , we discuss two approaches for building a quantum model for classification . in the first approach , the quantum device estimates inner products of quantum states to compute a classically intractable kernel . this kernel can be fed into any classical kernel method such as a support vector machine . in the second approach , we can use a variational quantum circuit as a linear model that classifies data explicitly in hilbert space . we illustrate these ideas with a feature map based on squeezing in a continuous - variable system , and visualise the working principle with $ 2$-dimensional mini - benchmark datasets .
