universal quantum gates and quantum error correction~(qec ) lie in the heart of quantum information science . large - scale quantum computing depends on a universal set of quantum gates , in which some gates may be easily carried out , while others are hard with a certain physical system . there is a unique three - qubit quantum gate called the deutsch gate~[$\mathbb{d}(\theta)$ ] , from which alone a circuit can be constructed so that any feasible quantum computing is attainable . as far as we know , however , $ \mathbb{d}(\theta)$ has not been demonstrated . here we design an easily realizable $ \mathbb{d}(\theta)$ by using rydberg blockade of neutral atoms , where $ \theta$ can be tuned to any value in $ [ 0,\pi]$ by adjusting the strengths of external control fields . using similar protocols , we further show that both the toffoli and cnot gates can be achieved with only three laser pulses . the toffoli gate , being universal for classical reversible computing , is also useful for qec that plays an important role in quantum communication and fault - tolerant quantum computation . the possibility and briefness to realize these gates shed new light on the study of quantum information with neutral atoms .
