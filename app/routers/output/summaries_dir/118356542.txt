classical objectivity as a property of quantum states --- a view proposed to explain the observer - independent character of our world from quantum theory , is an important step in bridging the quantum - classical gap . it was recently derived in terms of spectrum broadcast structures for small objects embedded in noisy photon - like environments . however , two fundamental problems have arisen : a description of objective motion and applicability to other types of environments . here we derive an example of objective states of motion in quantum mechanics by showing a formation of dynamical spectrum broadcast structures in the celebrated , realistic model of decoherence --- quantum brownian motion . we do it for realistic , thermal environments and show their noise - robustness . this opens a potentially new method of studying quantum - to - classical transition .
