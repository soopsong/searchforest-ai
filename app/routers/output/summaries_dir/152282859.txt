we investigate the discrimination of two candidates of an unknown parameter in quantum systems with continuous weak measurement , inspired by the application of hypothesis testing in distinguish - ing two hamiltonians [ kiilerich and m{\o}lmer , phys . rev . a , 98 , 022103 ( 2018 ) ] . based on the measurement output and stochastic master equation , temporal evolutions of posterior probabilities of two hypotheses are given by bayes ' formula . the bayes criterion is presented by the likelihood ratio conditioned on the outcome of measurements . different from the calculation method based on maximum a posteriori criterion , the bayes criterion based method for calculating the average prob - ability of making errors is more suitable and efficient in general situation of binary discrimination . finally , an example of distinguishing two candidate hamiltonians is given and the running times of calculating the average probability of error under the bayes criterion and the maximum a posteriori criterion are compared to illustrate the feasibility of the hypothesis testing in quickly distinguishing two candidates of the parameter to be estimated .
