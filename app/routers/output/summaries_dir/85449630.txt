reaction - diffusion systems can describe a wide class of rhythmic spatiotemporal patterns observed in chemical and biological systems , such as circulating pulses on a ring , oscillating spots , target waves , and rotating spirals . these rhythmic dynamics can be considered limit cycles of reaction - diffusion systems . however , the conventional phase - reduction theory , which provides a simple unified framework for analyzing synchronization properties of limit - cycle oscillators subjected to weak forcing , has mostly been restricted to low - dimensional dynamical systems . here , we develop a phase - reduction theory for stable limit - cycle solutions of infinite - dimensional reaction - diffusion systems . by generalizing the notion of isochrons to functional space , the phase sensitivity function - a fundamental quantity for phase reduction - is derived . for illustration , several rhythmic dynamics of the fitzhugh - nagumo model of excitable media are considered . nontrivial phase response properties and synchronization dynamics are revealed , reflecting their complex spatiotemporal organization . our theory will provide a general basis for the analysis and control of spatiotemporal rhythms in various reaction - diffusion systems .
