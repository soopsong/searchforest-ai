single photon source represent a fundamental building block for optical implementations of quantum information tasks ranging from basic tests of quantum physics to quantum communication and high - resolution quantum measurement . in this paper we investigate the performance of a multiplexed system based on asymmetric configuration of multiple heralded single photon sources . { to compare the effectiveness of different designs we introduce a single - photon source performance index that is based on the value of single photon probability required to achieve a guaranteed signal to noise ratio . } the performance and scalability comparison with both currently existing multiple - source architectures and faint laser configurations reveals an advantage the proposed scheme offers in realistic scenarios . this analysis also provides insights on the potential of using such architectures for integrated implementation .
