this paper presents a method for approximating a class of complex transfer function matrices corresponding to physically realizable complex linear quantum systems . the class of linear quantum systems under consideration includes interconnections of passive optical components such as cavities , beam - splitters , phase - shifters and interferometers . this approximation method builds on a previous result for cascade realization and gives good approximations at low frequencies .
