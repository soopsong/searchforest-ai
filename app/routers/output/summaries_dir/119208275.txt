accurate quantum tomography is a vital tool in both fundamental and applied quantum science . it is a task that involves processing a noisy measurement record in order to construct a reliable estimate of an unknown quantum state , and is central to quantum computing , metrology , and communication . to date , many different approaches to quantum state estimation have been developed , yet no one method fits all applications , and all fail relatively quickly as the dimensionality of the unknown state grows . in this work , we suggest that projected gradient descent is a method that can evade some of these shortcomings . we present three novel tomography algorithms that use projected gradient descent and compare their performance with state - of - the - art alternatives , i.e. the diluted iterative algorithm and convex programming . our results find in favour of the general class of projected gradient descent methods due to their speed , applicability to large states , and the range of conditions in which they perform .
