nonclassical properties of photon added and photon subtracted squeezed coherent states have been compared with specific focus on the higher order nonclassicalities , such as higher order squeezing , higher order sub - poissonian photon statistics , higher order antibunching . it is observed that both photon added and photon subtracted squeezed coherent states are highly nonclassical as they satisfy criteria for all of the above mentioned nonclassicalities and a set of other criteria including negativity of wigner function , klyshko 's criterion and agarwal 's $ ( a_{3})$ parameter . further , the amount of nonclassicality present in these two types of states has been compared quantitatively using a measure of nonclassicality known as nonclassical volume . variation in the amount of nonclassicality with the number of photon(s ) added / subtracted is also investigated , and it is found that the addition of photons makes the squeezed coherent state more nonclassical than what is done by the subtraction of photons .
