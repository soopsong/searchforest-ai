identifying the mode numbers in whispering - gallery mode resonators ( wgmrs ) is important for tailoring them to experimental needs . here we report on a novel experimental mode analysis technique based on the combination of frequency analysis and far - field imaging for high mode numbers of large wgmrs . the radial mode numbers q and the angular mode numbers p=$\ell$-m are identified and labeled via far - field imaging . the polar mode numbers $ \ell$ are determined unambiguously by fitting the frequency differences between individual whispering gallery modes ( wgms ) . this allows for the accurate determination of the geometry and the refractive index at different temperatures of the wgmr . for future applications in classical and quantum optics , this mode analysis enables one to control the narrow - band phase - matching conditions in nonlinear processes such as second - harmonic generation or parametric down - conversion .
