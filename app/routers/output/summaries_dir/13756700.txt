we consider a quantum system periodically driven with a strength which varies slowly on the scale of the driving period . the analysis is based on a general formulation of the floquet theory relying on the extended hilbert space . it is shown that the dynamics of the system can be described in terms of a slowly varying effective floquet hamiltonian that captures the long - term evolution , as well as rapidly oscillating micromotion operators . we obtain a systematic high - frequency expansion of all these operators . generalizing the previous studies , the expanded effective hamiltonian is now time - dependent and contains extra terms appearing due to changes in the periodic driving . the same applies to the micromotion operators which exhibit a slow temporal dependence in addition to the rapid oscillations . as an illustration , we consider a quantum - mechanical spin in an oscillating magnetic field with a slowly changing direction . the effective evolution of the spin is then associated with non - abelian geometric phases reflecting the geometry of the extended floquet space . the developed formalism is general and also applies to other periodically driven systems , such as shaken optical lattices with a time - dependent shaking strength , a situation relevant to the cold atom experiments .
