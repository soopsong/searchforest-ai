i revisit the ideas underlying dynamical decoupling methods within the framework of quantum information processing , and examine their potential for direct implementations in terms of encoded rather than physical degrees of freedom . the usefulness of encoded decoupling schemes as a tool for engineering both closed- and open - system encoded evolutions is investigated based on simple examples .
