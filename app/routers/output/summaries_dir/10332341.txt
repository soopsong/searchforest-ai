we demonstrate fiber fabry - perot ( ffp ) cavities with concave mirrors that can be operated at cavity lengths as large as 1.5 mm without significant deterioration of the finesse . this is achieved by using a laser dot machining technique to shape spherical mirrors with ultralow roughness and employing single - mode fibers with large mode area for good mode matching to the cavity . additionally , in contrast to previous ffps , these cavities can be used over an octave - spanning frequency range with adequate coatings . we also show directly that shape deviations caused by the fiber 's index profile lead to a finesse decrease as observed in earlier attempts to build long ffp cavities , and show a way to overcome this problem .
