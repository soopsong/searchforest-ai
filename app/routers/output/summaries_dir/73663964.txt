in this paper we study the scaling of the correction of the renyi entropy of the excited states in systems described , in the continuum limit , by a conformal field theory ( cft ) . these corrections scale as $ l^{-\frac{2\delta}{n}}$ , where $ l$ is the system size and $ \delta$ is the scaling dimension of a relevant bulk operator located around the singularities of the riemann surface $ \mathcal{r}_n$. their name is due to their explicit dependence on the riemann surface $ \mathcal{r}_n$. their presence has been detected in several works on the entanglement entropy in finite size systems , both in the ground and the excited states . here , we present a general study of these corrections based on the perturbation expansion on $ \mathcal{r}_n$. some of the terms in this expansion are divergent and they will be cured with addition cut - offs . these cut - offs will determine how these corrections scale with the system size $ l$. exact numerical computations of the renyi entropy of the excited states of the xx model are provided and they confirm our theoretical prediction on the scaling of corrections . they allow also a comparison with the other works present in the literature finding that the corrections , for the excited states , have the exact same form of the ones of the ground state case multiplied by a model dependend function of $ n$ and $ l / l$.
