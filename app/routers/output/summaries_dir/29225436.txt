we analyze the problem of quantum - limited estimation of a stochastically varying phase of a continuous beam ( rather than a pulse ) of the electromagnetic field . we consider both non - adaptive and adaptive measurements , and both dyne detection ( using a local oscillator ) and interferometric detection . we take the phase variation to be \dot\phi = \sqrt{\kappa}\xi(t ) , where \xi(t ) is \delta - correlated gaussian noise . for a beam of power p , the important dimensionless parameter is n = p/\hbar\omega\kappa , the number of photons per coherence time . for the case of dyne detection , both continuous - wave ( cw ) coherent beams and cw ( broadband ) squeezed beams are considered . for a coherent beam a simple feedback scheme gives good results , with a phase variance \simeq n^{-1/2}/2 . this is \sqrt{2 } times smaller than that achievable by nonadaptive ( heterodyne ) detection . for a squeezed beam a more accurate feedback scheme gives a variance scaling as n^{-2/3 } , compared to n^{-1/2 } for heterodyne detection . for the case of interferometry only a coherent input into one port is considered . the locally optimal feedback scheme is identified , and it is shown to give a variance scaling as n^{-1/2 } . it offers a significant improvement over nonadaptive interferometry only for n of order unity .
