in this report , we discuss possibilities to detect a signal at the target from the quantum illumination protocol , that could serve as a quantum radar . we assume a simple universal detecting schema on the target and study if it is possible to discover the quantum illumination measurement and in what conditions considering the microwave regime . assuming many simplifications , we found that the possibility or the advantage of the detection of the quantum illumination measurement strongly depends on the realization of the quantum illumination protocol .
