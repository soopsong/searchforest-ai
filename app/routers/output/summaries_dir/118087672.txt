we determine the minimal experimental resources that ensure a unique solution in the estimation of trace - preserving quantum channels with both direct and convex optimization methods . a convenient parametrization of the constrained set is used to develop a globally converging newton - type algorithm that ensures a physically admissible solution to the problem . numerical simulations are provided to support the results , and indicate that the minimal experimental setting is sufficient to guarantee good estimates .
