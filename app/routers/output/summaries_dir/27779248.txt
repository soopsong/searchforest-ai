microring resonators made from silicon are becoming a popular microscale device format for generating photon pairs at telecommunications wavelengths at room temperature . in compact devices with a footprint less than $ 5\times 10^{-4}$ mm$^2 $ , we demonstrate pair generation using only a few microwatts of average pump power . we discuss the role played by important parameters such as the loss , group - velocity dispersion and the ring - waveguide coupling coefficient in finding the optimum operating point for silicon microring pair generation . silicon photonics can be fabricated using deep ultraviolet lithography wafer - scale fabrication processes , which is scalable and cost - effective . such small devices and low pump power requirements , and the side - coupled waveguide geometry which uses an integrated waveguide , could be beneficial for future scaled - up architectures where many pair - generation devices are required on the same chip .
