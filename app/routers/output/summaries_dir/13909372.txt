we consider two variants of a quantum - statistical generalization of the cramer - rao inequality that establishes an invariant lower bound on the mean square error of a generalized quantum measurement . the proposed complex variant of this inequality leads to a precise formulation of a generalized uncertainty principle for arbitrary states , in contrast to helstrom 's symmetric variant in which these relations are obtained only for pure states . a notion of canonical states is introduced and the lower mean square error bound is found for estimating of the parameters of canonical states , in particular , the canonical parameters of a lie group . it is shown that these bounds are globally attainable only for canonical states for which there exist efficient measurements or quasimeasurements .
