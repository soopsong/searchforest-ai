we establish a reformulation of the connes embedding problem in terms of an asymptotic property of factorizable completely positive maps . we also prove that the holevo - werner channels w_n^- are factorizable , for all odd integers n different from 3 . furthermore , we investigate factorizability of convex combinations of w_3^+ and w_3 ^ - , a family of channels studied by mendl and wolf , and discuss asymptotic properties for these channels .
