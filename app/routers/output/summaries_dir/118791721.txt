a scheme for conditional generating a hermite polynomial excited squeezed vacuum states ( hesvs ) is proposed . injecting a two - mode squeezed vacuum state ( tmsvs ) into a beam splitter ( bs ) and counting the photons in one of the output channels , the conditional state in the other output channel is just a hesvs . to exhibit a number of nonclassical effects and non - guassianity , we mainly investigate the photon number distribution , sub - poissonian distribution , quadrature component distribution , and quasi - probability distribution of the hpesvs . we find that its nonclassicality closely relates to the control parameter of the bs , the squeezed parameter of the tmsvs , and the photon number of conditional measurement . these further demonstrate that performing the conditional measurement on a bs is an effective approach to generate non - guassian state .
