physical systems for quantum computation require calibration of the control parameters based on their physical characteristics by performing a chain of experiments that gather most precise information about the given device . it follows that there is a need for automated data acquisition and interpretation . in this work , we have developed a tool that allows for automatic analysis of single - tone spectroscopy ( sts ) results for a single cell consisting of qubit and resonator in the circuit quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) architecture . using analytic approaches and maximum likelihood estimation , our algorithm is capable of finding all relevant physical characteristics of the cell by using only the measured sts data . the described approach is fast and robust to noise , and its open - source python implementation can readily be used to calibrate transmon qubits coupled to notch - port resonators .
