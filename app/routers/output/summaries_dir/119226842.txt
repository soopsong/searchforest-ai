based on the lyapunov control , we present a scheme to realize state transfer with high fidelity by only modulating the boundary spins in a quantum spin-1/2 chain . recall that the conventional transmission protocols aim at nonstationary state ( or information ) transfer from the first spin to the end spin at a fixed time . the present scheme possesses the following advantages . first , the scheme does not require precise manipulations of the control time . second , it is robust against uncertainties in the initial states and fluctuations in the control fields . third , the controls are exerted only on the boundary sites of the chain . it works for variable spin-1/2 chains with different periodic structures and has good scalability . the feasibility to replace the control fields by square pules is explored , which simplifies the realization in experiments .
