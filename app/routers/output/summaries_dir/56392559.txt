the tsallis relative entropy $ s_q ( \hat{\rho},\hat{\sigma})$ measures the distance between two arbitrary density matrices $ \hat{\rho}$ and $ \hat{\sigma}$. in this work the approximation to this quantity when $ q=1+\delta$ ( $ \delta\ll 1 $ ) is obtained . it is shown that the resulting series is equal to the von neumann relative entropy when $ \delta=0$. analyzing the von neumann relative entropy for arbitrary $ \hat{\rho}$ and a thermal equilibrium state $ \hat{\sigma}=e^{- \beta \hat{h}}/{\rm tr}(e^{- \beta \hat{h}})$ is possible to define a new inequality relating the energy , the entropy , and the partition function of the system . from this inequality , a parameter that measures the distance between the two states is defined . this distance is calculated for a general qubit system and for an arbitrary unimodal gaussian state . in the qubit case , the dependence on the purity of the system is studied for $ t \geq 0 $ and also for $ t<0$. in the gaussian case , the general partition function given a unimodal quadratic hamiltonian is calculated and the comparison of the thermal light state as a thermal equilibrium state of the parametric amplifier is presented .
