we present a detailed analysis of spin squeezing of the one - axis twisting model with a many - body phase dephasing , which is induced by external field fluctuation in a two - mode bose - einstein condensates . even in the presence of the dephasing , our analytical results show that the optimal initial state corresponds to a coherent spin state $ |\theta_{0 } , \phi_0\rangle$ with the polar angle $ \theta_0=\pi/2$. if the dephasing rate $ \gamma\ll s^{-1/3}$ , where $ s$ is total atomic spin , we find that the smallest value of squeezing parameter ( i.e. , the strongest squeezing ) obeys the same scaling with the ideal one - axis twisting case , namely $ \xi^2\propto s^{-2/3}$. while for a moderate dephasing , the achievable squeezing obeys the power rule $ s^{-2/5}$ , which is slightly worse than the ideal case . when the dephasing rate $ \gamma > s^{1/2}$ , we show that the squeezing is weak and neglectable .
