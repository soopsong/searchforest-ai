device - independent randomness generation and quantum key distribution protocols rely on a fundamental relation between the non - locality of quantum theory and its random character . this relation is usually expressed in terms of a trade - off between the probability of guessing correctly the outcomes of measurements performed on quantum systems and the amount of violation of a given bell inequality . however , a more accurate assessment of the randomness produced in bell experiments can be obtained if the value of several bell expressions is simultaneously taken into account , or if the full set of probabilities characterizing the behavior of the device is considered . we introduce protocols for device - independent randomness generation , secure against classical side information , that rely on the estimation of an arbitrary number of bell expressions or even directly on the experimental frequencies of measurement outcomes . asymptotically , this results in an optimal generation of randomness from experimental data ( as measured by the min - entropy ) , without having to assume beforehand that the devices violate a specific bell inequality .
