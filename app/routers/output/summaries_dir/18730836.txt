we study the question whether disentanglement of hawking radiation can be achieved with any local operation . we assume that the operation we look for is unitary and can be described by a bogoliubov transformation . this allows to formulate requirements on the operation of disentanglement . we then show that these requirements can be fulfilled by a timelike boundary condition in the near - horizon area and that the local observer does not notice the presence of the boundary and does not encounter a firewall .
