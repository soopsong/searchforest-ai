we study the storage and retrieval of images in a hot atomic vapor using the gradient echo memory protocol . we demonstrate that this technique allows for the storage of multiple spatial modes . we study both spatial and temporal multiplexing by storing a sequence of two different images in the atomic vapor . the effect of atomic diffusion on the spatial resolution is discussed and characterized experimentally . for short storage time a normalized cross - correlation between a retrieved image and its input of 88 % is reported .
