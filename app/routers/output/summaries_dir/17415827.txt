in this paper , the problem of synthesizing a general hermitian quantum gate into a set of primary quantum gates is addressed . to this end , an extended version of the jacobi approach for calculating the eigenvalues of hermitian matrices in linear algebra is considered as the basis of the proposed synthesis method . the quantum circuit synthesis method derived from the jacobi approach and its optimization challenges are described . it is shown that the proposed method results in multiple - control rotation gates around the y axis , multiple - control phase shift gates , multiple - control not gates and a middle diagonal hermitian matrix , which can be synthesized to multiple - control pauli z gates . using the proposed approach , it is shown how multiple - control u gates , where u is a single - qubit hermitian quantum gate , can be implemented using a linear number of elementary gates in terms of circuit lines with the aid of one auxiliary qubit in an arbitrary state .
