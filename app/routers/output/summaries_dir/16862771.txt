we show that when the speed of control is bounded , there is a widely applicable minimal - time control problem for which a coherent feedback protocol is optimal , and is faster than all measurement - based feedback protocols , where the latter are defined in a strict sense . the superiority of the coherent protocol is due to the fact that it can exploit a geodesic path in hilbert space , a path that measurement - based protocols can not follow .
