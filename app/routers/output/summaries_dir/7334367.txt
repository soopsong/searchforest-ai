we study perfect state transfer of quantum walks on signed graphs . our aim is to show that negative edges are useful for perfect state transfer . specific results we prove include : ( 1 ) the signed join of a negative 2-clique with any positive ( n,3)-regular graph has perfect state transfer even if the unsigned join does not . curiously , the perfect state transfer time improves as n increases . ( 2 ) a signed complete graph has perfect state transfer if its positive subgraph is a regular graph with perfect state transfer and its negative subgraph is periodic . this shows that signing is useful for creating perfect state transfer since no complete graph ( except for the 2-clique ) has perfect state transfer . ( 3 ) the double - cover of a signed graph has perfect state transfer if the positive subgraph has perfect state transfer and the negative subgraph is periodic . here , signing is useful for constructing unsigned graphs with perfect state transfer . furthermore , we study perfect state transfer on a family of signed graphs called the exterior powers which is derived from a many - fermion quantum walk on graphs .
