this paper is concerned with a filtering problem for a class of nonlinear quantum stochastic systems with multichannel nondemolition measurements . the system - observation dynamics are governed by a markovian hudson - parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equation driven by quantum wiener processes of bosonic fields in vacuum state . the hamiltonian and system - field coupling operators , as functions of the system variables , are represented in a weyl quantization form . using the wigner - moyal phase - space framework , we obtain a stochastic integro - differential equation for the posterior quasi - characteristic function ( qcf ) of the system conditioned on the measurements . this equation is a spatial fourier domain representation of the belavkin - kushner - stratonovich stochastic master equation driven by the innovation process associated with the measurements . we also discuss a more specific form of the posterior qcf dynamics in the case of linear system - field coupling and outline a gaussian approximation of the posterior quantum state .
