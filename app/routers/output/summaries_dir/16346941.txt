boson - sampling is a classically computationally hard problem that can - in principle - be efficiently solved with quantum linear optical networks . very recently , a rush of experimental activity has ignited with the aim of developing such devices as feasible instances of quantum simulators . even approximate boson - sampling is believed to be hard with high probability if the unitary describing the optical network is drawn from the haar measure . in this work we show that in this setup , with probability exponentially close to one in the number of bosons , no symmetric algorithm can distinguish the boson - sampling distribution from the uniform one from fewer than exponentially many samples . this means that the two distributions are operationally indistinguishable without detailed a priori knowledge . we carefully discuss the prospects of efficiently using knowledge about the implemented unitary for devising non - symmetric algorithms that could potentially improve upon this . we conclude that due to the very fact that boson - sampling is believed to be hard , efficient classical certification of boson - sampling devices seems to be out of reach .
