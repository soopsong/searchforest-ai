in this paper , we investigate how quantum architectures affect the efficiency of the execution of the quantum fourier transform ( qft ) and linear transformations , which are essential parts of the stabilizer / clifford group circuits . in particular , we show that in most common and realistic physical architectures including the linear nearest neighbor , two - dimensional lattice , and bounded degree graph ( containing a chain of length n ) , n - qubit qft and n - qubit stabilizer circuits can be parallelized to linear depth using no auxiliary qubits . we construct lower bounds that show the efficiency of our approach .
