we consider topological quantum memories for a general class of abelian anyon models defined on spin lattices . these are non - universal for quantum computation when restricting to topological operations alone , such as braiding and fusion . the effects of additional non - topological operations , such as spin measurements , are studied . these are shown to allow universal quantum computation , while still utilizing topological protection . our work gives an insight into the relation between abelian models and their non - abelian counterparts .
