we analyze the backaction of homodyne detection and photodetection on superconducting qubits in circuit quantum electrodynamics . although both measurement schemes give rise to backaction in the form of stochastic phase rotations , which leads to dephasing , we show that this can be perfectly undone provided that the measurement signal is fully accounted for . this result improves upon that of phys . rev . a , 82 , 012329 ( 2010 ) , showing that the method suggested can be made to realize a perfect two - qubit parity measurement . we propose a benchmarking experiment on a single qubit to demonstrate the method using homodyne detection . by analyzing the limited measurement efficiency of the detector and bandwidth of the amplifier , we show that the parameter values necessary to see the effect are within the limits of existing technology .
