we study the general framework of quantum channel simulation , that is , the ability of a quantum channel to simulate another one using different classes of codes . first , we show that the minimum error of simulation and the one - shot quantum simulation cost under no - signalling assisted codes are given by semidefinite programs . second , we introduce the channel 's smooth max - information , which can be seen as a one - shot generalization of the mutual information of a quantum channel . we provide an exact operational interpretation of the channel 's smooth max - information as the one - shot quantum simulation cost under no - signalling assisted codes , which significantly simplifies the study of channel simulation and provides insights and bounds for the case under entanglement - assisted codes . third , we derive the asymptotic equipartition property of the channel 's smooth max - information ; i.e. , it converges to the quantum mutual information of the channel in the independent and identically distributed asymptotic limit . this implies the quantum reverse shannon theorem in the presence of no - signalling correlations . finally , we explore the simulation cost of various quantum channels .
