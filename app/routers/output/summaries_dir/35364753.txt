we demonstrate a surface - electrode ion trap fabricated using techniques transferred from the manufacture of photonic - crystal fibres . this provides a relatively straightforward route for realizing traps with an electrode structure on the 100 micron scale with high optical access . we demonstrate the basic functionality of the trap by cooling a single ion to the quantum ground state , allowing us to measure a heating rate from the ground state of 787(24 ) quanta / s . variation of the fabrication procedure used here may provide access to traps in this geometry with trap scales between 100 um and 10 um .
