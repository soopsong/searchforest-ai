the realization of quantum computing 's promise despite noisy imperfect qubits relies , at its core , on the ability to scale cheaply through error correction and fault - tolerance . while fault - tolerance requires relatively mild assumptions about the nature of the errors , the overhead associated with coherent and non - markovian errors can be orders of magnitude larger than the overhead associated with purely stochastic markovian errors . one proposal , known as pauli frame randomization , addresses this challenge by randomizing the circuits so that the errors are rendered incoherent , while the computation remains unaffected . similarly , randomization can suppress couplings to slow degrees of freedom associated with non - markovian evolution . here we demonstrate the implementation of circuit randomization in a superconducting circuit system , exploiting a flexible programming and control infrastructure to achieve this with low effort . we use high - accuracy gate - set tomography to demonstrate that without randomization the natural errors experienced by our experiment have coherent character , and that with randomization these errors are rendered incoherent . we also demonstrate that randomization suppresses signatures of non - markovianity evolution to statistically insignificant levels . this demonstrates how noise models can be shaped into more benign forms for improved performance .
