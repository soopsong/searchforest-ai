single - photon detectors in space must retain useful performance characteristics despite being bombarded with sub - atomic particles . mitigating the effects of this space radiation is vital to enabling new space applications which require high - fidelity single - photon detection . to this end , we conducted proton radiation tests of various models of avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) and one model of photomultiplier tube potentially suitable for satellite - based quantum communications . the samples were irradiated with 106 mev protons at doses approximately equivalent to lifetimes of 0.6 , 6 , 12 and 24 months in a low - earth polar orbit . although most detection properties were preserved , including efficiency , timing jitter and afterpulsing probability , all apd samples demonstrated significant increases in dark count rate ( dcr ) due to radiation - induced damage , many orders of magnitude higher than the 200 counts per second ( cps ) required for ground - to - satellite quantum communications . we then successfully demonstrated the mitigation of this dcr degradation through the use of deep cooling , to as low as -86 degrees c. this achieved dcr below the required 200 cps over the 24 months orbit duration . dcr was further reduced by thermal annealing at temperatures of +50 to +100 degrees c.
