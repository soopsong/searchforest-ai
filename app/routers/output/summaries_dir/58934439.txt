near term quantum computers with a high quantity ( around 50 ) and quality ( around 0.995 fidelity for two - qubit gates ) of qubits will approximately sample from certain probability distributions beyond the capabilities of known classical algorithms on state - of - the - art computers , achieving the first milestone of so - called quantum supremacy . this has stimulated recent progress in classical algorithms to simulate quantum circuits . classical simulations are also necessary to approximate the fidelity of multiqubit quantum computers using cross entropy benchmarking . here we present numerical results of a classical simulation algorithm to sample universal random circuits , on a single workstation , with more qubits and depth than previously reported . for example , circuits with $ 5 \times 9 $ qubits of depth 37 , $ 7 \times 8 $ qubits of depth 27 , and $ 10 \times ( \kappa>10)$ ) qubits of depth 19 are all easy to sample . we also show up to what depth the sampling , or estimation of observables , is trivially parallelizable . the algorithm is related to the"feynmann path"method to simulate quantum circuits . for low - depth circuits , the algorithm scales exponentially in the depth times the smaller lateral dimension , or the treewidth , as explained in boixo et . al . , and therefore confirms the bounds in that paper . in particular , circuits with $ 7 \times 7 $ qubits and depth 40 remain currently out of reach . follow up work on a supercomputer environment will tighten this bound .
