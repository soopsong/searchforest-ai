since the dawn of quantum theory , coherence was attributed as a key to understand the weirdness of fundamental concepts like the wave - particle duality and the stern - gerlach experiment . recently , based on a resource theory approach , the notion of quantum coherence was revisited and a plethora of coherence quantifiers were proposed . in this work , we address this issue using the language of coherence orders , developed by the nmr community . this allowed us to investigate the role played by different subspaces of the hilbert - schmidt space into physical processes and quantum protocols . we found some links between decoherence and each coherence order . moreover , we propose a sufficient and straightforward criterion to testify the usefulness of a given state for quantum enhanced phase estimation , relying on a minimal set of elements belonging to the density matrix .
