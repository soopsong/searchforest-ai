quantum ensemble classification has significant applications in discrimination of atoms ( or molecules ) , separation of isotopic molecules and quantum information extraction . however , quantum mechanics forbids deterministic discrimination among nonorthogonal states . the classification of inhomogeneous quantum ensembles is very challenging since there exist variations in the parameters characterizing the members within different classes . in this paper , we recast quantum ensemble classification as a supervised quantum learning problem . a systematic classification methodology is presented by using a sampling - based learning control ( slc ) approach for quantum discrimination . the classification task is accomplished via simultaneously steering members belonging to different classes to their corresponding target states ( e.g. , mutually orthogonal states ) . firstly a new discrimination method is proposed for two similar quantum systems . then an slc method is presented for quantum ensemble classification . numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the binary classification of two - level quantum ensembles and the multiclass classification of multilevel quantum ensembles .
