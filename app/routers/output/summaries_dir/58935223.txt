we demonstrate the implementation of a spin qubit with a single ca ion in a micro ion trap . the qubit is encoded in the zeeman ground state levels mj=+1/2 and mj=-1/2 of the s1/2 state of the ion . we show sideband cooling close to the vibrational ground state and demonstrate the initialization and readout of the qubit levels with 99.5 % efficiency . we employ a raman transition close to the s1/2 - p1/2 resonance for coherent manipulation of the qubit . we observe single qubit rotations with 96 % fidelity and gate times below 5mus . rabi oscillations on the blue motional sideband are used to extract the phonon number distribution . the dynamics of this distribution is analyzed to deduce the trap - induced heating rate of 0.3(1 ) phonons / ms .
