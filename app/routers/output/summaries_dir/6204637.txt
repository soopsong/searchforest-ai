we study an optomechanical cavity , in which a buckled suspended beam serves as a mirror . the mechanical resonance frequency of the beam obtains a minimum value near the buckling temperature . contrary to the common case , in which self - excited oscillations of the suspended mirror are optically induced by injecting blue detuned laser light , in our case self - excited oscillations are observed with red detuned light . these observations are attributed to a retarded thermal ( i.e. bolometric ) force acting on the buckled mirror in the inwards direction ( i.e. towards to other mirror ) . with relatively high laser power other interesting effects are observed including period doubling of self - excited oscillations and intermode coupling .
