optically trapped nanoparticles have recently emerged as exciting candidates for tests of quantum mechanics at the macroscale and as versatile platforms for ultrasensitive metrology . recent experiments have demonstrated parametric feedback cooling , nonequilibrium physics , and temperature detection , all in the classical regime . here we provide the first quantum model for trapped nanoparticle cooling and force sensing . in contrast to existing theories , our work indicates that the nanomechanical ground state may be prepared without using an optical resonator ; that the cooling mechanism corresponds to nonlinear friction ; and that the energy loss during cooling is nonexponential in time . our results show excellent agreement with experimental data in the classical limit , and constitute an underlying theoretical framework for experiments aiming at ground state preparation . our theory also addresses the optimization of , and the fundamental quantum limit to , force sensing , thus providing theoretical direction to ongoing searches for ultra - weak forces using levitated nanoparticles .
