the techniques of cavity optomechanics have enabled significant achievements in precision sensing , including the detection of gravitational waves and the cooling of mechanical systems to their quantum ground state . recently , the inherent non - linearity in the optomechanical interaction has been harnessed to explore synchronization effects , including the spontaneous locking of an oscillator to a reference injection signal delivered via the optical field . here , we present the first demonstration of a radiation - pressure driven optomechanical system locking to an inertial drive , with actuation provided by an integrated electrical interface . we use the injection signal to suppress drift in the optomechanical oscillation frequency , strongly reducing phase noise by over 55 dbc / hz at 2 hz offset . we further employ the injection tone to tune the oscillation frequency by more than 2 million times its narrowed linewidth . in addition , we uncover previously unreported synchronization dynamics , enabled by the independence of the inertial drive from the optical drive field . finally , we show that our approach may enable control of the optomechanical gain competition between different mechanical modes of a single resonator . the electrical interface allows enhanced scalability for future applications involving arrays of injection - locked precision sensors .
