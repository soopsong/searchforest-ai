flatbands feature the distortion - free storage of compact localized states of tailorable shape . their reliable storage sojourn is , however , limited by disorder potentials , which generically cause uncontrolled coupling into dispersive bands . we find that , while detuning flatband states from band intersections suppresses their direct decay into dispersive bands , disorder - induced state distortion causes a delayed , dephasing - mediated decay , lifting the static nature of flatband states and setting a finite lifetime for the reliable storage sojourn . we exemplify this generic , disorder - induced decay mechanism at the cross - stitch lattice . our analysis , which applies platform - independently , relies on the time - resolved treatment of disorder - averaged quantum systems with quantum master equations .
