the inspiration for this theoretical paper comes from recent experiments on a pt - symmetric system of two coupled optical whispering galleries ( optical resonators ) . the optical system can be modeled as a pair of coupled linear oscillators , one with gain and the other with loss . if the coupled oscillators have a balanced loss and gain , the system is described by a hamiltonian and the energy is conserved . this theoretical model exhibits two pt transitions depending on the size of the coupling parameter \epsilon . for small \epsilon the pt symmetry is broken and the system is not in equilibrium , but when \epsilon becomes sufficiently large , the system undergoes a transition to an equilibrium phase in which the pt symmetry is unbroken . for very large \epsilon the system undergoes a second transition and is no longer in equilibrium . the classical and the quantized versions of the system exhibit transitions at exactly the same values of \epsilon .
