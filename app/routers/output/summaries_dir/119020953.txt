in his original work josephson predicted that a phase - dependent conductance should be present in superconducting tunnel junctions , an effect difficult to detect , mainly because it is hard to single it out from the usual non - dissipative josephson current . we propose a solution for this problem that consists in using different superconducting materials to realize the two junctions of a superconducting interferometer . according to the ambegaokar - baratoff relation the two junctions have different conductances if the critical currents are equal , thus the josephson current can be suppressed by fixing the magnetic flux in the loop at half of a flux quantum without cancelling the phase - dependent conductance . our proposal can be used to study the phase - dependent conductance , an effect present in principle in all superconducting weak links . from the standpoint of nonlinear circuit theory such a device is in fact an ideal memristor with possible applications to memories and neuromorphic computing in the framework of ultrafast and low energy consumption superconducting digital circuits .
