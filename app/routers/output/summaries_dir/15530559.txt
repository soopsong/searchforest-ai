we establish the best possible approximation to a perfect quantum cloning machine which produces two clones out of a single input . we analyze both universal and state - dependent cloners . the maximal fidelity of cloning is shown to be 5/6 for universal cloners . it can be achieved either by a special unitary evolution or by a novel teleportation scheme . we construct the optimal state - dependent cloners operating on any prescribed two non - orthogonal states , discuss their fidelities and the use of auxiliary physical resources in the process of cloning . the optimal universal cloners permit us to derive a new upper bound on the quantum capacity of the depolarizing quantum channel .
