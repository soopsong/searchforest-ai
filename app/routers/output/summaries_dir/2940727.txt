we review the entanglement properties in collective models and their relationship with quantum phase transitions . focusing on the concurrence which characterizes the two - spin entanglement , we show that for first - order transition , this quantity is singular but continuous at the transition point , contrary to the common belief . we also propose a conjecture for the concurrence of arbitrary symmetric states which connects it with a recently proposed criterion for bipartite entanglement .
