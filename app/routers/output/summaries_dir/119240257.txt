pricing interest - rate financial derivatives is a major problem in finance , in which it is crucial to accurately reproduce the time - evolution of interest rates . several stochastic dynamics have been proposed in the literature to model either the instantaneous interest rate or the instantaneous forward rate . a successful approach to model the latter is the celebrated heath - jarrow - morton framework , in which its dynamics is entirely specified by volatility factors . on its multifactor version , this model considers several noisy components to capture at best the dynamics of several time - maturing forward rates . however , as no general analytical solution is available , there is a trade - off between the number of noisy factors considered and the computational time to perform a numerical simulation . here , we employ the quantum principal component analysis to reduce the number of noisy factors required to accurately simulate the time evolution of several time - maturing forward rates . the principal components are experimentally estimated with the $ 5$-qubit ibmqx2 quantum computer for $ 2\times 2 $ and $ 3\times 3 $ cross - correlation matrices , which are based on historical data for two and three time - maturing forward rates . this manuscript is a first step towards the design of a general quantum algorithm to fully simulate on quantum computers the heath - jarrow - morton model for pricing interest - rate financial derivatives . it shows indeed that practical applications of quantum computers in finance will be achievable in the near future .
