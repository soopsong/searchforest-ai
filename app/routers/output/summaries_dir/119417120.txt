we propose a scheme to realize universal quantum gates between nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers in an optically trapped nanodiamond , through uniform magnetic field induced coupling between the nv centers and the torsional mode of the levitated nanodiamond . the gates are tolerant to the thermal noise of the torsional mode . by combining the scheme with dynamical decoupling technology , it is found that the high fidelity quantum gates are possible for the present experimental conditions . the proposed scheme is useful for nv - center - based quantum network and distributed quantum computation
