the efficiency of the future devices for quantum information processing is limited mostly by the finite decoherence rates of the qubits . recently a substantial progress was achieved in enhancing the time , which a solid - state qubit demonstrates a coherent dynamics . this progress is based mostly on a successful isolation of the qubits from external decoherence sources . under these conditions the material - inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial role . in most cases the noise that quantum device demonstrate has 1 / f spectrum . this suggests that the environment that destroys the phase coherence of the qubit can be thought of as a system of two - state fluctuators , which experience random hops between their states . in this short review we discuss the current state of the theory of the decoherence due to the qubit interaction with the fluctuators . we describe the effect of such an environment on different protocols of the qubit manipulations - free induction and echo signal . it turns out that in many important cases the noise produced by the fluctuators is non - gaussian . consequently the results of the interaction of the qubit with the fluctuators are not determined by the pair correlation function only . we describe the effect of the fluctuators using so - called spin - fluctuator model . being quite realistic this model allows one to evaluate the qubit dynamics in the presence of one fluctuator exactly . this solution is found , and its features , including non - gaussian effects are analyzed in details . we extend this consideration for the systems of large number of fluctuators , which interact with the qubit and lead to the 1 / f noise . we discuss existing experiments on the josephson qubit manipulation and try to identify non - gaussian behavior .
