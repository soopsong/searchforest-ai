numerical methods for the 1-d dirac equation based on operator splitting and on the quantum lattice boltzmann ( qlb ) schemes are reviewed . it is shown that these discretizations fall within the class of quantum walks , i.e. discrete maps for complex fields , whose continuum limit delivers dirac - like relativistic quantum wave equations . the correspondence between the quantum walk dynamics and these numerical schemes is given explicitly , allowing a connection between quantum computations , numerical analysis and lattice boltzmann methods . the qlb method is then extended to the dirac equation in curved spaces and it is demonstrated that the quantum walk structure is preserved . finally , it is argued that the existence of this link between the discretized dirac equation and quantum walks may be employed to simulate relativistic quantum dynamics on quantum computers .
