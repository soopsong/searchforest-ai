understanding and manipulating work fluctuations in microscale and nanoscale systems are of both fundamental and practical interest . for example , aspects of work fluctuations will be an important factor in designing nanoscale heat engines . in this work , an optimal control approach directly exploiting jarzynski 's equality is proposed to effectively suppress the fluctuations in the work statistics , for systems ( initially at thermal equilibrium ) subject to a work protocol but isolated from a bath during the protocol . the control strategy is to minimize the deviations of individual values of exp(-\beta w ) from their ensemble average given by exp(-\beta \delta f } , where w is the work , \beta\ is the inverse temperature , and \delta f is the free energy difference between two equilibrium states . it is further shown that even when the system hamiltonian is not fully known , it is still possible to suppress work fluctuations through a feedback loop , by refining the control target function on the fly through jarzynski 's equality itself . numerical experiments are based on linear and nonlinear parametric oscillators . optimal control results for linear parametric oscillators are also benchmarked with early results based on accelerated adiabatic processes .
