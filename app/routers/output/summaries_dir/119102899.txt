we proposed two linear optics based entanglement concentration protocols ( ecps ) to obtain maximally entangled 4-mode cluster - type entangled coherent state ( ecs ) from less ( partially ) entangled cluster - type ecs . the first ecp is designed using a superposition of single - mode coherent state with two unknown parameters , whereas the second ecp is obtained using a superposition of single - mode coherent state and a superposition of two - mode coherent state with four unknown parameters . the success probabilities have been calculated for both the ecps . necessary quantum circuits enabling future experimental realizations of the proposed ecps are provided using linear optical elements . further , the benefit of the proposed schemes is established in the context of long distance quantum communication where photon loss is an obstruction .
