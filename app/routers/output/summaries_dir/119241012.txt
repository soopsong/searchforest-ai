we present a method to probe the out - of - time - order correlators ( otocs ) of a general system by coupling it to a harmonic oscillator probe . when the system 's degrees of freedom are traced out , the otocs imprint themselves on the generalized influence functional of the oscillator . this generalized influence functional leads to a local effective action for the probe whose couplings encode otocs of the system . we study the structural features of this effective action and the constraints on the couplings from microscopic unitarity . we comment on how the otocs of the system appear in the otocs of the probe .
