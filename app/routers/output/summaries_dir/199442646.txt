we propose a distributed design method for decentralized control by exploiting the underlying sparsity properties of the problem . our method is based on chordal decomposition of sparse block matrices and the alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) . we first apply a classical parameterization technique to restrict the optimal decentralized control into a convex problem that inherits the sparsity pattern of the original problem . the parameterization relies on a notion of strongly decentralized stabilization , and sufficient conditions are discussed to guarantee this notion . then , chordal decomposition allows us to decompose the convex restriction into a problem with partially coupled constraints , and the framework of admm enables us to solve the decomposed problem in a distributed fashion . consequently , the subsystems only need to share their model data with their direct neighbours , not needing a central computation . numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method .
