constructing compact quantum circuits for universal quantum gates on solid - state systems is crucial for quantum computing . we present some compact quantum circuits for a deterministic solid - state quantum computing , including the cnot , toffoli , and fredkin gates on the diamond nitrogen - vacancy centers confined inside cavities , achieved by some input - output processes of a single photon . our quantum circuits for these universal quantum gates are simple and economic . moreover , additional electron qubits are not employed , but only a single - photon medium . these gates have a long coherent time . we discuss the feasibility of these universal solid - state quantum gates , concluding that they are feasible with current technology .
