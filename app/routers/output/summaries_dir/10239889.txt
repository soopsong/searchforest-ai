this paper considers the physical realizability condition for multi - level quantum systems having polynomial hamiltonian and multiplicative coupling with respect to several interacting boson fields . specifically , it generalizes a recent result the authors developed for two - level quantum systems . for this purpose , the algebra of su(n ) was incorporated . as a consequence , the obtained condition is given in terms of the structure constants of su(n ) .
