we study coherent phonon oscillations and tunneling between two coupled nonlinear nanomechanical resonators . we show that the coupling between two nanomechanical resonators creates an effective phonon josephson junction which exhibits two different dynamical behaviors : josephson oscillation ( phonon - rabi oscillation ) and macroscopic self - trapping ( phonon blockade ) . self - trapping originates from mechanical nonlinearities , meaning that when the nonlinearity exceeds its critical value , the energy exchange between the two resonators is suppressed , and phonon - josephson oscillations between them are completely blocked . an effective classical hamiltonian for the phonon josephson junction is derived and its mean - field dynamics is studied in phase space . finally , we study the phonon - phonon coherence quantified by the mean fringe visibility , and show that the interaction between the two resonators may lead to the loss of coherence in the phononic junction .
