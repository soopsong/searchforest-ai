we present a quantum teleportation experiment in the quantum relay configuration using the installed telecommunication network of swisscom . in this experiment , the bell state measurement occurs well after the entanglement has been distributed , at a point where the photon upon which data is teleported is already far away , and the entangled qubits are photons created from a different crystal and laser pulse than the teleported qubit . a raw fidelity of 0.93+/-0.04 has been achieved using a heralded single - photon source .
