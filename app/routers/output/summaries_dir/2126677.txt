we present a method for calculating the energy levels of superconducting circuits that contain highly anharmonic , inductively - shunted modes with arbitrarily strong coupling . our method starts by calculating the normal modes of the linearized circuit and proceeds with numerical diagonalization in this basis . as an example , we analyze the hamiltonian of a fluxonium qubit inductively coupled to a readout resonator . while elementary , this simple example is nontrivial because it can not be efficiently treated by the method known as"black - box quantization,"numerical diagonalization in the bare harmonic oscillator basis , or perturbation theory . calculated spectra are compared to measured spectroscopy data , demonstrating excellent quantitative agreement between theory and experiment .
