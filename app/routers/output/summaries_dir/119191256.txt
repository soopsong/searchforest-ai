boson sampling is a simple model for non - universal linear optics quantum computing using far fewer physical resources than universal schemes . an input state comprising vacuum and single photon states is fed through a haar - random linear optics network and sampled at the output using coincidence photodetection . this problem is strongly believed to be classically hard to simulate . we show that an analogous procedure implements the same problem , using photon - added or -subtracted squeezed vacuum states ( with arbitrary squeezing ) , where sampling at the output is performed via parity measurements . the equivalence is exact and independent of the squeezing parameter , and hence provides an entire class of new quantum states of light in the same complexity class as boson sampling .
