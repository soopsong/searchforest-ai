in this paper we study photon pairs generated in a nonlinear cavity , composed of a nonlinear crystal surrounded by mirrors , by the process of spontaneous parametric downconversion . we analyze two different regimes : singly - resonant cavities where the signal and idler modes are resonant , and doubly - resonant cavities where the pump mode is also resonant . we present analytic expressions for the joint spectral amplitude in these two cases , and study the reduction in emission bandwidth as the cavity coefficient finesse is increased . we also study the enhancement of the source brightness resulting from the presence of the cavity .
