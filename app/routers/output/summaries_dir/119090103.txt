we study full counting statistics of electron tunneling in coulomb - blockade systems in the limit of short measuring - time intervals . this limit is particularly suited to identify correlations among tunneling events , but only when analyzing the charge - transfer statistics in terms of factorial cumulants $ c_{{\rm f } , m}(t)$ rather than ordinary ones commonly used in literature . in the absence of correlations , the short - time behavior of the factorial cumulants is given by $ c_{{\rm f } , m}(t ) \propto ( -1)^{m-1}t^m$. a different sign and/or a different power law of the time dependence indicates correlations . we illustrate this for sequential and andreev tunneling in a metallic single - electron box .
