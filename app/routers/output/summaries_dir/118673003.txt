we study cross - kerr ( ck ) effect on an optomechanical system driven by two - tone fields . we show that in the presence of the ck effect , a bistable behavior of the mean photon number in the cavity becomes more robust against the fluctuations of the frequency detuning between the cavity mode and the control field . the bistability can also be turned into a tri - stability within the experimentally accessible range of the system parameters . also , we find that the symmetric profile of the optomechanically induced transparency is broken and the zero - absorption point is shifted in the presence of the ck effect . this shift can be used to measure the strength of the ck effect , and the asymmetric absorption profiles can be employed to engineer a high quality factor of the cavity .
