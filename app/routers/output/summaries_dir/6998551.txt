we propose to use digital memcomputing machines ( dmms ) , implemented with self - organizing logic gates ( solgs ) , to solve the problem of numerical inversion . starting from fixed - point scalar inversion we describe the generalization to solving linear systems and matrix inversion . this method , when realized in hardware , will output the result in only one computational step . as an example , we perform simulations of the scalar case using a 5-bit logic circuit made of solgs , and show that the circuit successfully performs the inversion . our method can be extended efficiently to any level of precision , since we prove that producing n - bit precision in the output requires extending the circuit by at most n bits . this type of numerical inversion can be implemented by dmm units in hardware , it is scalable , and thus of great benefit to any real - time computing application .
