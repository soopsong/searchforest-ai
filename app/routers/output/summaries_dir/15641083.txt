we evaluate the advantages of performing cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) on a very - far - off - resonance atomic system . we consider a ladder system with a weak ( few - photon level ) control coherent field imparting a conditional nonlinear phase shift on a probe beam . we find that by coupling to an optical resonator the optimal xpm is enhanced proportional to the finesse of the resonator by a factor of $ f/4\pi$. we present a semi - classical description of the system and show that the phenomenon is optimal in the self - defined condition of off - resonance - effective - cooperativity equal to one .
