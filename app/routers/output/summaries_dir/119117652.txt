in a recent work [ a. metelmann and a. a. clerk , phys . rev . x 5 , 021025 ( 2015 ) ] , a general reservoir - engineering approach for generating non - reciprocal quantum interactions and devices was described . we show here how in many cases this general recipe can be viewed as an example of autonomous feed - forward : the full dissipative evolution is identical to the unconditional evolution in a setup where an observer performs an ideal quantum measurement of one system , and then uses the results to drive a second system . we also extend the application of this approach to non - reciprocal quantum amplifiers , showing the added functionality possible when using two engineered reservoirs . in particular , we demonstrate how to construct an ideal phase - preserving cavity - based amplifier which is full non - reciprocal , quantum - limited and free of any fundamental gain - bandwidth constraint .
