it has been proved by kempe that discrete quantum walks on the hypercube ( hc ) hit exponentially faster than the classical analog . the same was also observed numerically by krovi and brun for a slightly different property , namely , the expected hitting time . yet , to what extent this striking result survives in more general graphs , is to date an open question . here we tackle this question by studying the expected hitting time for quantum walks on hcs that are embedded into larger symmetric structures . by performing numerical simulations of the discrete quantum walk and deriving a general expression for the classical hitting time , we observe an exponentially increasing gap between the expected classical and quantum hitting times , not only for walks on the bare hc , but also for a large family of embedded hcs . this suggests that the quantum speedup is stable with respect to such embeddings .
