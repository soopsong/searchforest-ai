while feedback control has many applications in quantum systems , finding optimal control protocols for this task is generally challenging . so - called"verification theorems"and"viscosity solutions"provide two useful tools for this purpose : together they give a simple method to check whether any given protocol is optimal , and provide a numerical method for finding optimal protocols . while treatments of verification theorems usually use sophisticated mathematical language , this is not necessary . in this article we give a simple introduction to feedback control in quantum systems , and then describe verification theorems and viscosity solutions in simple language . we also illustrate their use with a concrete example of current interest .
