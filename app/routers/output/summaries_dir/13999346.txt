after close to two decades of research and development , superconducting circuits have emerged as a rich platform for both quantum computation and quantum simulation . lattices of superconducting coplanar waveguide ( cpw ) resonators have been shown to produce artificial materials for microwave photons , where weak interactions can be introduced either via non - linear resonator materials or strong interactions via qubit - resonator coupling . here , we highlight the previously - overlooked property that these lattice sites are deformable and allow the realization of tight - binding lattices which are unattainable , even in conventional solid - state systems . in particular , we show that networks of cpw resonators can create a new class of materials which constitute regular lattices in an effective hyperbolic space with constant negative curvature . we present numerical simulations of a series of hyperbolic analogs of the kagome lattice which show unusual densities of states with a spectrally - isolated degenerate flat band . we also present a proof - of - principle experimental realization of one of these lattices . this paper represents the first step towards on - chip quantum simulation of materials science and interacting particles in curved space .
