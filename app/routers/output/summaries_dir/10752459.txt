the purpose of this work is to pose and solve the problem to guide a collection of weakly interacting dynamical systems ( agents , particles , etc . ) to a specified terminal distribution . the framework is that of mean - field and of cooperative games . a terminal cost is used to accomplish the task ; we establish that the map between terminal costs and terminal probability distributions is onto . our approach relies on and extends the theory of optimal mass transport and its generalizations .
