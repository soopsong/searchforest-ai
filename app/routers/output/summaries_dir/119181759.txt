the rabi model , a two - level atom coupled to a harmonic oscillator , can undergo a second - order quantum phase transition ( qpt ) [ m. -j . hwang et al , phys . rev . lett . 115 , 180404 ( 2015 ) ] . here we show that the rabi qpt accompanies critical behavior in the higher energy excited states , i.e. , the excited - state qpt ( esqpt ) . we derive analytic expressions for the semiclassical density of states , which shows a logarithmic divergence at a critical energy eigenvalue in the broken symmetry ( superradiant ) phase . moreover , we find that the logarithmic singularities in the density of states leads to singularities in the relevant observables in the system such as photon number and atomic polarization . we corroborate our analytical semiclassical prediction of the esqpt in the rabi model with its numerically exact quantum mechanical solution .
