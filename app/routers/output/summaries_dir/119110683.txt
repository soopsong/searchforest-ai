we consider a coupled - cavity array ( cca ) , where one cavity interacts with a two - level atom under the rotating - wave approximation . we investigate the excitation transport dynamics across the array , which arises in the atom 's emission process into the cca vacuum . due to the known formation of atom - photon bound states , partial field localization and atomic population trapping in general take place . we study the functional dependance on the coupling strength of these two phenomena and show that the threshold values beyond which they become significant are different . as the coupling strength grows from zero , field localization is exhibited first .
