photon subtraction can enhance the performance of continuous - variable quantum key distribution ( cv qkd ) . however , the enhancement effect will be reduced by the imperfections of practical devices , especially the limited efficiency of a single - photon detector . in this paper , we propose a non - gaussian postselection method to emulate the photon substraction used in coherent - state cv qkd protocols . the virtual photon subtraction not only can avoid the complexity and imperfections of a practical photon - subtraction operation , which extends the secure transmission distance as the ideal case does , but also can be adjusted flexibly according to the channel parameters to optimize the performance . furthermore , our preliminary tests on the information reconciliation suggest that in the low signal - to - noise ratio regime , the performance of reconciliating the postselected non - gaussian data is better than that of the gaussian data , which implies the feasibility of implementing this method practically .
