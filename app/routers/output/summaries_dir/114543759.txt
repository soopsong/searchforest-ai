we report on the design and implementation of a field programmable josephson amplifier ( fpja ) - a compact and lossless superconducting circuit that can be programmed \textit{in situ } by a set of microwave drives to perform reciprocal and nonreciprocal frequency conversion and amplification . in this work we demonstrate four modes of operation : frequency conversion ( $ -0.5~\mathrm{db}$ transmission , $ -30~\mathrm{db}$ reflection ) , circulation ( $ -0.5~\mathrm{db}$ transmission , $ -30~\mathrm{db}$ reflection , $ 30~\mathrm{db}$ isolation ) , phase - preserving amplification ( gain $ > 20~\mathrm{db}$ , $ 1~\mathrm{photon}$ of added noise ) and directional phase - preserving amplification ( $ -10~\mathrm{db}$ reflection , $ 18~\mathrm{db}$ forward gain , $ 8~\mathrm{db}$ reverse isolation , $ 1~\mathrm{photon}$ of added noise ) . the system exhibits quantitative agreement with theoretical prediction . based on a gradiometric superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) with nb / al - alo$_x$/nb josephson junctions , the fpja is first - order insensitive to flux noise and can be operated without magnetic shielding at low temperature . due to its flexible design and compatibility with existing superconducting fabrication techniques , the fpja offers a straightforward route toward on - chip integration with superconducting quantum circuits such as qubits or microwave optomechanical systems .
