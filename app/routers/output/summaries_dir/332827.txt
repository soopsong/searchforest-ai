xmds2 is a cross - platform , gpl - licensed , open source package for numerically integrating initial value problems that range from a single ordinary differential equation up to systems of coupled stochastic partial differential equations . the equations are described in a high - level xml - based script , and the package generates low - level optionally parallelised c++ code for the efficient solution of those equations . it combines the advantages of high - level simulations , namely fast and low - error development , with the speed , portability and scalability of hand - written code . xmds2 is a complete redesign of the xmds package , and features support for a much wider problem space while also producing faster code .
