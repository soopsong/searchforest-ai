we consider the fate of a small classical object , a"stick " , as it falls through the horizon of a large black hole ( bh ) . classically , the equivalence principle dictates that the stick is affected by small tidal forces , and hawking 's quantum - mechanical model of bh evaporation makes essentially the same prediction . if , on the other hand , the bh horizon is surrounded by a"firewall " , the stick will be consumed as it falls through . we have recently extended hawking 's model by taking into account the quantum fluctuations of the geometry and the classical back - reaction of the emitted particles . here , we calculate the strain exerted on the falling stick for our model . the strain depends on the near - horizon state of the hawking pairs . we find that , after the page time when the state of the pairs deviates significantly from maximal entanglement ( as required by unitarity ) , the induced strain in our semiclassical model is still parametrically small . this is because the number of the disentangled pairs is parametrically smaller than the bh entropy . a firewall does , however , appear if the number of disentangled pairs near the horizon is of order of the bh entropy , as implicitly assumed in previous discussions in the literature .
