in this paper we consider quantum walks whose evolution converges to the dirac equation one in the limit of small wave - vectors . we show exact fast fourier implementation of the dirac quantum walks in one , two and three space dimensions . the behaviour of particle states , defined as states smoothly peaked in some wave - vector eigenstate of the walk , is described by an approximated dispersive differential equation that for small wave - vectors gives the usual dirac particle and antiparticle kinematics . the accuracy of the approximation is provided in terms of a lower bound on the fidelity between the exactly evolved state and the approximated one . the jittering of the position operator expectation value for states having both a particle and an antiparticle component is analytically derived and observed in the numerical implementations .
