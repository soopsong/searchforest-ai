we study a proof - of - principle example of the recently proposed hybrid quantum - classical simulation of strongly correlated fermion models in the thermodynamic limit . in a"two - site"dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) approach we reduce the hubbard model to an effective impurity model subject to self - consistency conditions . the resulting minimal two - site representation of the non - linear hybrid setup involves four qubits implementing the impurity problem , plus an ancilla qubit on which all measurements are performed . we outline a possible implementation with superconducting circuits feasible with near - future technology .
