nonlinear phenomena are inherent in most systems in nature . second or higher - order harmonic generations , three - wave and four - wave mixing are typical phenomena in nonlinear optics . to obtain a nonzero signal for second - harmonic generation in the long - wavelength limit ( $ q\rightarrow0 $ ) , the breaking of inversion symmetry is required . in topological materials , a hexagonal warping term which breaks the rotation symmetry of the fermi surface is observed by angular - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) . if a gap opens ( e.g. , by doping with magnetic impurities ) the inversion symmetry will be broken . here we use a nonlinear response theory based on a generalized kubo formula to explain the frequency up - conversion in topological materials .
