this work proposes numerical tests which determine whether a two - qubit operator has an atypically simple quantum circuit . specifically , we describe formulae , written in terms of matrix coefficients , characterizing operators implementable with exactly zero , one , or two controlled - not ( cnot ) gates and all other gates being one - qubit . we give an algorithm for synthesizing two - qubit circuits with optimal number of cnot gates , and illustrate it on operators appearing in quantum algorithms by deutsch - josza , shor and grover . in another application , our explicit numerical tests allow timing a given hamiltonian to compute a cnot modulo one - qubit gates , when this is possible .
