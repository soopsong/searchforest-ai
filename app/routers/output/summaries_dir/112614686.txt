a traveling wave parametric amplifier ( twpa ) composed of a transmission line made up of a chain of coupled asymmetric superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) is proposed . the unique nature of this transmission line is that its nonlinearity can be tuned with an external magnetic flux and can even change sign . this feature of the transmission line can be used to perform phase matching in a degenerate four - wave mixing process which can be utilized for parametric amplification of a weak signal in the presence of a strong pump . numerical simulations of the twpa design have shown that with tuning , phase matching can be achieved and an exponential gain as a function of the transmission line length can be realized . the flexibility of the proposed design can realize : compact twpas with less than 211 unit cells , signal gains greater than 20 db , 3 db bandwidth greater than 5.4 ghz , and saturation powers up to -98 dbm . this amplifier design is well suited for multiplexed readout of quantum circuits or astronomical detectors in a compact configuration which can foster on - chip implementations .
