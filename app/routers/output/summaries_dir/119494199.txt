we address the estimation of the magnetic field b acting on an ensemble of atoms with total spin j subjected to collective transverse noise . by preparing an initial spin coherent state , for any measurement performed after the evolution , the mean - square error of the estimate is known to scale as $ 1 / j$ , i.e. no quantum enhancement is obtained . here , we consider the possibility of continuously monitoring the atomic environment , and conclusively show that strategies based on time - continuous non - demolition measurements followed by a final strong measurement may achieve heisenberg - limited scaling $ 1/{j^2}$ and also a monitoring - enhanced scaling in terms of the interrogation time . we also find that time - continuous schemes are robust against detection losses , as we prove that the quantum enhancement can be recovered also for finite measurement efficiency . finally , we analytically prove the optimality of our strategy .
