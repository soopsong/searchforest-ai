we describe a realistic scheme for coupling atoms or other quantum emitters with an array of coupled optical cavities . we consider open fabry - perot microcavities coupled to the emitters . our central innovation is to connect the microcavities to waveguide resonators , which are in turn evanescently coupled to each other on a photonic chip to form a coupled cavity chain . in this paper , we describe the components , their technical limitations and the factors that need to be determined experimentally . this provides the basis for a detailed theoretical analysis of two possible experiments to realize quantum squeezing and controlled quantum dynamics . we close with an outline of more advanced applications .
