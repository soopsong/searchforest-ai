we investigate absolutely maximally entangled ( ame ) states , which are multipartite quantum states that are maximally entangled with respect to any possible bipartition . these strong entanglement properties make them a powerful resource for a variety of quantum information protocols . in this paper , we show the existence of ame states for any number of parties , given that the dimension of the involved systems is chosen appropriately . we prove the equivalence of ame states shared between an even number of parties and pure state threshold quantum secret sharing ( qss ) schemes , and prove necessary and sufficient entanglement properties for a wider class of ramp qss schemes . we further show how ame states can be used as a valuable resource for open - destination teleportation protocols and to what extend entanglement swapping generalizes to ame states .
