we demonstrate theoretically how photon number statistics of a driven , damped oscillator at finite temperature can be extracted by measuring the dephasing spectrum of a two - level system dispersively coupled to the oscillator ; we thus extend the work of dykman ( 1987 ) and gambetta et al . ( 2006 ) . we carefully consider the fidelity of this scheme-- to what extent does the measurement reflect the initial number statistics of the mode ? we also derive analytic results for the dephasing of a qubit by a driven , thermal mode , and compare results obtained at different levels of approximation . our results have relevance both to experiments in circuit cavity qed , as well as to nano - electromechanical systems .
