the symmetric subpace has many applications in quantum information theory . this review article begins by explaining key background facts about the symmetric subspace from a quantum information perspective . then we review , and in some places extend , work of werner and chiribella that connects the symmetric subspace to state estimation , optimal cloning , the de finetti theorem and other topics . in the third and final section , we discuss how the symmetric subspace can yield concentration - of - measure results via the calculation of higher moments of random quantum states . there are no new results in this article , but only some new proofs of existing results , such as a variant of the exponential de finetti theorem . the purpose of the article is ( a ) pedagogical , and ( b ) to collect in one place many , if not all , of the quantum information applications of the symmetric subspace .
