entanglement properties of gaussian states of light as well as the security of continuous variable quantum key distribution with gaussian states in free - space fading channels are studied . these qualities are shown to be sensitive to the statistical properties of the transmittance distribution in the cases when entanglement is strong or when channel excess noise is present . fading , i.e. transmission fluctuations , caused by beam wandering due to atmospheric turbulence , is a frequent challenge in free - space communication . we introduce a method of fading discrimination and subsequent post - selection of the corresponding sub - states and show that it can improve the entanglement resource and restore the security of the key distribution over a realistic fading link . furthermore , the optimal post - selection strategy in combination with an optimized entangled resource is shown to drastically increase the protocol robustness to excess noise , which is confirmed for experimentally measured fading channel characteristics . the stability of the result against finite data ensemble size and imperfect channel estimation is also addressed .
