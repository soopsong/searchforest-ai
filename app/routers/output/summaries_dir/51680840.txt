we analyze the harvesting of entanglement and classical correlations from the quantum vacuum to particle detectors . we assess the impact on the detectors ' harvesting ability of the spacetime dimensionality , the suddenness of the detectors ' switching , their physical size and their internal energy structure . our study reveals several interesting dependences on these parameters that can be used to optimize the harvesting of classical and quantum correlations . furthermore , we find that , contrary to previous belief , smooth switching is much more efficient than sudden switching in order to harvest vacuum entanglement , especially when the detectors remain spacelike separated . additionally , we show that the reported phenomenology of spacelike entanglement harvesting is not altered by subleading order perturbative corrections .
