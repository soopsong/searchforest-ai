a secret sharing scheme is a cryptographic protocol to distribute a secret state in an encoded form among a group of players such that only authorized subsets of the players can reconstruct the secret . classically , efficient secret sharing schemes have been shown to be induced by matroids . furthermore , access structures of such schemes can be characterized by an excluded minor relation . no such relations are known for quantum secret sharing schemes . in this paper we take the first steps toward a matroidal characterization of quantum secret sharing schemes . in addition to providing a new perspective on quantum secret sharing schemes , this characterization has important benefits . while previous work has shown how to construct quantum secret sharing schemes for general access structures , these schemes are not claimed to be efficient . in this context the present results prove to be useful ; they enable us to construct efficient quantum secret sharing schemes for many general access structures . more precisely , we show that an identically self - dual matroid that is representable over a finite field induces a pure state quantum secret sharing scheme with information rate one .
