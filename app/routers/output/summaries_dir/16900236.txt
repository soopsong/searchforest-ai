simultaneous measurement of multiple qubits stored in hyperfine levels of trapped 111cd+ ions is realized with an intensified charge - coupled device ( ccd ) imager . a general theory of fluorescence detection for hyperfine qubits is presented and applied to experimental data . the use of an imager for photon detection allows for multiple qubit state measurement with detection fidelities of greater than 98 % . improvements in readout speed and fidelity are discussed in the context of scalable quantum computation architectures .
