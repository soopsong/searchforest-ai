realistic models of quantum systems must include dissipative interactions with an environment . for weakly - damped systems the lindblad - form markovian master equation is invaluable for this task due to its tractability and efficiency . this equation only applies , however , when the frequencies of any subset of the system 's transitions are either equal ( degenerate ) , or their differences are much greater than the transitions ' linewidths ( far - detuned ) . outside of these two regimes the only available efficient description has been the bloch - redfield master equation . this equation has long been the subject of debate because it does not guarantee to preserve the positivity of the density matrix . the ability to efficiently simulate weakly - damped systems across all regimes is becoming increasingly important , especially in the area of quantum technologies . here we derive a completely positive , lindblad - form master equation valid for all regimes , and demonstrate its accuracy by comparing it to exact simulations of a variety of systems coupled to an ohmic bath . the new master equation describes all weakly - damped systems for which , like the ohmic bath , the spectral density does not vary sharply on the scale of the transitions ' lamb shifts and linewidths . we also show via exact simulations of two examples , that the trivial adiabatic extension of this master equation can accurately describe systems with time - dependent transition frequencies that cross each other during the evolution , so long as the time dependence is not too fast . system identification tools , developed in systems engineering , play an important role in our analysis . we expect that these tools will prove useful in other areas of physics involving complex systems .
