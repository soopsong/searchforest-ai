we propose a method to manipulate the normal modes in a chain of trapped ions using only two lasers . linear chains of trapped ions have proven experimentally to be highly controllable quantum systems with a variety of refined techniques for preparation , evolution , and readout , however , typically for quantum information processing applications people have been interested in using the internal levels of the ions as the computational basis . we analyse the case where the motional degrees of freedom of the ions is the quantum system of interest , and where the internal levels are leveraged to facilitate interactions . in particular , we focus on an analysis of mode - mixing of phonons in different normal modes to mimic the quantum optical equivalent of a beam splitter .
