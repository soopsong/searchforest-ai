arrays of circuit cavities offer fascinating perspectives for exploring quantum many - body systems in a driven dissipative regime where excitation losses are continuously compensated by coherent input drives . here we investigate a system consisting of three transmission line resonators , where the two outer ones are driven by coherent input sources and the central resonator interacts with a superconducting qubit . whereas a low excitation number regime of such a device has been considered previously with a numerical integration , we here specifically address the high excitation density regime . we present analytical approximations to these regimes in the form of two methods . the first method is a bogoliubov or linear expansion in quantum fluctuations which can be understood as an approximation for weak nonlinearities . as the second method we introduce a combination of mean - field decoupling for the photon tunneling with an exact approach to a driven kerr nonlinearity which can be understood as an approximation for low tunneling rates . in contrast to the low excitation regime we find that for high excitation numbers the anti - bunching of output photons from the central cavity does not monotonously disappear as the tunnel coupling between the resonators is increased .
