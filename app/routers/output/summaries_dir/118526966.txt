dissipation is introduced to a strongly interacting ultracold bosonic gas in the mott - insulator regime of a 3d spin - dependent optical lattice . a weakly interacting superfluid comprised of atoms in a state that does not experience the lattice potential acts as a dissipative bath coupled to the lattice atoms via collisions . lattice atoms are excited to higher - energy bands via bragg transitions , and the resulting bath - induced decay is measured using the atomic quasimomentum distribution . a competing but slower intrinsic decay mechanism arising from collisions between lattice atoms is also investigated . the measured bath - induced decay rate is compared with the predictions of a weakly interacting model with no free parameters . the presence of intrinsic decay , which can not be accommodated within this framework , signals that strong interactions may play a central role in the lattice - atom dynamics .
