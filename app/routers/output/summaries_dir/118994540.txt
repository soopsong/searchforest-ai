we propose a method to generate an optical schr\"odinger - cat - like state in a cavity in a substantial decoherence regime . even when the cavity decay rate is considerably large , a cat - like state can be generated in a laser - like setting if the gain for the field is larger than the loss . under the condition that opposite - phase atomic dipoles repeatedly traverse the cavity , the cavity field converges to a squeezed vacuum state in a steady state . a schr\"odinger - cat - like state is then generated when a single photon decay occurs . the phase - space distribution of the cat state can be revealed in homodyne detection by using the decaying photon as a herald event . quantum trajectory simulation was used to identify the conditions for the schr\"odinger - cat - like state formation as well as to analyze the properties of those states . based on these simulations , possible experiments are proposed within the reach of the current technology .
