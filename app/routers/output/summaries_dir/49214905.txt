we investigate the rank of the average mixing matrix of trees , with all eigenvalues distinct . the rank of the average mixing matrix of a tree on $ n$ vertices with $ n$ distinct eigenvalues is upper - bounded by $ \frac{n}{2}$. computations on trees up to $ 20 $ vertices suggest that the rank attains this upper bound most of the times . we give an infinite family of trees whose average mixing matrices have ranks which are bounded away from this upper bound . we also give a lower bound on the rank of the average mixing matrix of a tree .
