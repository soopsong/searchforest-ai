metastable transitions in langevin dynamics can exhibit rich behaviors that are markedly different from its overdamped limit . in addition to local alterations of the transition path geometry , more fundamental global changes may exist . for instance , when the dissipation is weak , heteroclinic connections that exist in the overdamped limit do not necessarily have a counterpart in the langevin system , potentially leading to different transition rates . furthermore , when the friction coefficient depends on the velocity , the overdamped limit no longer exists , but it is still possible to efficiently find instantons . the approach we employed for these discoveries was based on ( i ) a simple rewriting of the freidlin - wentzell action in terms of time - reversed dynamics , and ( ii ) an adaptation of the string method , which was originally designed for gradient systems , to this specific non - gradient system .
