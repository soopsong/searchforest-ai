a protocol of quantum energy teleportation is proposed for a one - dimensional harmonic chain . a coherent - state povm measurement is performed to coupled oscillators of the chain in the ground state accompanied by energy infusion to the system . this measurement consumes a part of ground state entanglement . depending on the measurement result , a displacement operation is performed on a distant oscillator accompanied by energy extraction from the zero - point fluctuation of the oscillator . we find that the amount of consumed entanglement is bounded from below by a positive value that is proportional to the amount of teleported energy .
