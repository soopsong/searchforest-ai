the question of whether quantum spatial search in two dimensions can be made optimal has long been an open problem . we report progress towards its resolution by showing that the oracle complexity for target location can be made optimal , by increasing the number of calls to the walk operator that incorporates the graph structure by a logarithmic factor . our algorithm does not require amplitude amplification . an important ingredient of our algorithm is the implementation of multi - step quantum walks by graph powering , using a coin space of walk - length dependent dimension , which may be of independent interest . finally , we demonstrate how to implement quantum walks arising from powers of symmetric markov chains using our methods .
