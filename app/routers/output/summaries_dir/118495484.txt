we address the characterization of dissipative bosonic channels and show that estimation of the loss rate by gaussian probes ( coherent or squeezed ) is improved in the presence of kerr nonlinearity . in particular , enhancement of precision may be substantial for short interaction time , i.e. for media of moderate size , e.g. biological samples . we analyze in detail the behaviour of the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) , and determine the values of nonlinearity maximizing the qfi as a function of the interaction time and of the parameters of the input signal . we also discuss the precision achievable by photon counting and quadrature measurement and present additional results for truncated , few - photon , probe signals . finally , we discuss the origin of the precision enhancement , showing that it can not be linked quantitatively to the non - gaussianity of the interacting probe signal .
