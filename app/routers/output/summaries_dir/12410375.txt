contemporary technological challenges often involve many degrees of freedom in a distributed or networked setting . three aspects are notable : the variables are usually associated with the nodes of a graph with limited communication resources , hindering centralized control ; the communication is subjected to noise ; and the number of variables can be very large . these three aspects make tools and techniques from statistical physics particularly suitable for the performance analysis of such networked systems in the limit of many variables ( analogous to the thermodynamic limit in statistical physics ) . perhaps not surprisingly , phase - transition like phenomena appear in these systems , where a sharp change in performance can be observed with a smooth parameter variation , with the change becoming discontinuous or singular in the limit of infinite system size . in this paper we analyze the so called network consensus problem , prototypical of the above considerations , that has been previously analyzed mostly in the context of additive noise . we show that qualitatively new phase - transition like phenomena appear for this problem in the presence of multiplicative noise . depending on dimensions and on the presence or absence of a conservation law , the system performance shows a discontinuous change at a threshold value of the multiplicative noise strength . in the absence of the conservation law , and for graph spectral dimension less than two , the multiplicative noise threshold ( the stability margin of the control problem ) is zero . this is reminiscent of the absence of robust controllers for certain classes of centralized control problems . although our study involves a toy model we believe that the qualitative features are generic , with implication for the robust stability of distributed control systems , as well as the effect of roundoff errors and communication noise on distributed algorithms .
