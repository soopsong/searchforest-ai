the performance enhancements observed in various models of continuous quantum thermal machines have been linked to the buildup of coherences in a preferred basis . but , is this connection always an evidence of ` quantum - thermodynamic supremacy ' ? by force of example , we show that this is not the case . in particular , we compare a power - driven three - level continuous quantum refrigerator with a four - level combined cycle , partly driven by power and partly by heat . we focus on the weak driving regime and find the four - level model to be superior since it can operate in parameter regimes in which the three - level model can not , it may exhibit a larger cooling rate , and , simultaneously , a better coefficient of performance . furthermore , we find that the improvement in the cooling rate matches the increase in the stationary quantum coherences exactly . crucially , though , we also show that the thermodynamic variables for both models follow from a classical representation based on graph theory . this implies that we can build incoherent stochastic - thermodynamic models with the same steady - state operation or , equivalently , that both coherent refrigerators can be emulated classically . more generally , we prove this for any n - level weakly driven device with a ` cyclic ' pattern of transitions . therefore , even if coherence is present in a specific quantum thermal machine , it is often not essential to replicate the underlying energy conversion process .
