we report on the realization of a synchronous source of heralded single photons at telecom wavelengths with mhz heralding rates and high heralding efficiency . this source is based on the generation of photon pairs at 810 and 1550 nm via spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) in a 1 cm periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) crystal pumped by a 532 nm pulsed laser . as high rates are fundamental for multi - photon experiments , we show that single telecom photons can be announced at 4.4mhz rate with 45 % heralding efficiency . when we focus only on the optimization of the coupling of the heralded photon , the heralding efficiency can be increased up to 80 % . furthermore , we experimentally observe that group velocity mismatch inside long crystals pumped in a pulsed mode affects the spectrum of the emitted photons and their fibre coupling efficiency . the length of the crystal in this source has been chosen as a trade off between high brightness and high coupling efficiency .
