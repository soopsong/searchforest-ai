in ion trap quantum information processing , efficient fluorescence collection is critical for fast , high - fidelity qubit detection and ion - photon entanglement . the expected size of future many - ion processors require scalable light collection systems . we report on the development and testing of a microfabricated surface - electrode ion trap with an integrated high numerical aperture ( na ) micromirror for fluorescence collection . when coupled to a low na lens , the optical system is inherently scalable to large arrays of mirrors in a single device . we demonstrate stable trapping and transport of 40ca+ ions over a 0.63 na micromirror and observe a factor of 1.9 enhancement in photon collection compared to the planar region of the trap .
