we express alltop 's construction of mutually unbiased bases as orbits under the weyl - heisenberg group in prime dimensions and find a related construction in dimensions 2 and 4 . we reproduce alltop 's mutually unbiased bases using abelian subgroups of the clifford group in prime dimensions , in direct analogy to the well - known construction of mutually unbiased bases using abelian subgroups of the weyl - heisenberg group . finally , we prove three theorems relating to the distances and linear dependencies among different sets of mutually unbiased bases .
