we propose a generation of a low - noise state of optomechanical oscillator by a temperature dependent force . we analyze the situation in which a quantum optomechanical oscillator ( denoted as the membrane ) is driven by an external force ( produced by the piston ) . both systems are embedded in a common heat bath at certain temperature $ t$. the driving force the piston exerts on the membrane is bath temperature dependent . initially , for $ t = t_0 $ , the piston is linearly coupled to the membrane . the bath temperature is then reversibly changed to $ t\neq t_0$. the change of temperature shifts the membrane , but simultaneously also increases its fluctuations . the resulting equilibrium state of the membrane is analyzed from the point of view of mechanical , as well as of thermodynamic characteristics . we compare these characteristics of membrane and derive their intimate connection . next , we cool down the thermal noise of the membrane , bringing it out of equilibrium , still being in the contact with heat bath . this cooling retains the effective canonical gibbs state with the effective temperature $ t^\star$. in such case we study the analogs of the equilibrium quantities for low - noise mechanical states of the membrane .
