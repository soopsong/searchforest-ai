we discuss quantum entanglement in the context of the thermodynamic arrow of time . we review the role of correlations in entropy - decreasing events and prove that the occurrence of a transformation between two thermodynamic states constitutes a new type of entanglement witness , one not defined as a separating plane in state space between separable and entangled states , but as a physical process dependent on the local initial properties of the states . extending work by partovi , we consider a general entangled multipartite system that allows large reversals of the thermodynamic arrow of time . we describe a hierarchy of arrows that arises from the different correlations allowed in a quantum state and examine these features in the context of maxwell 's demon . we examine in detail the case of three qubits , and also propose some simple experimental demonstrations possible with small numbers of qubits .
