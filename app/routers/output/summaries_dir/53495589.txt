the swap gate plays a central role in network designs for qubit quantum computation . however , there is a view to generalize qubit quantum computing to higher dimensional quantum systems . in this paper we construct a generalized swap gate using only instances of the generalized controlled - not gate to cyclically permute the states of $ d$ qudits for $ d$ prime .
