the state of the spatially correlated down - converted photons is usually treated as a two - mode gaussian entangled state . while intuitively this seems to be reasonable , it is known that new structures in the spatial distributions of these photons can be observed when the phase - matching conditions are properly taken into account . here , we study how the variances of the near- and far - field conditional probabilities are affected by the phase - matching functions , and we analyze the role of the epr - criterion regarding the non - gaussianity and entanglement detection of the spatial two - photon state of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) . then we introduce a statistical measure , based on the negentropy of the joint distributions at the near- and far - field planes , which allows for the quantification of the non - gaussianity of this state . this measure of non - gaussianity requires only the measurement of the autocorrelation covariance sub - matrices , and will be relevant for new applications of the spatial correlation of spdc in cv quantum information processing .
