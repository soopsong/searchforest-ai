the recent observation of the dynamical casimir effect in a modulated superconducting waveguide , coronating thirty years of world - wide research , empowered the quantum technology community with a powerful tool to create entangled photons on - chip . in this work we show how , going beyond the single waveguide paradigm using a scalable array , it is possible to create multipartite nonclassical states , with the possibility to control the long - range quantum correlations of the emitted photons . in particular , our finite - temperature theory shows how maximally entangled $ noon$ states can be engineered in a realistic setup . the results here presented open the way to new kinds of quantum fluids of light , arising from modulated vacuum fluctuations in linear systems .
