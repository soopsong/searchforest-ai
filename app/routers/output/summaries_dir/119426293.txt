for a special class of bipartite states we calculate explicitly the asymptotic relative entropy of entanglement $ e_r^\infty$ with respect to states having a positive partial transpose ( ppt ) . this quantity is an upper bound to distillable entanglement . the states considered are invariant under rotations of the form $ o\otimes o$ , where $ o$ is any orthogonal matrix . we show that in this case $ e_r^\infty$ is equal to another upper bound on distillable entanglement , constructed by rains . to perform these calculations , we have introduced a number of new results that are interesting in their own right : ( i ) the rains bound is convex and continuous ; ( ii ) under some weak assumption , the rains bound is an upper bound to $ e_r^\infty$ ; ( iii ) for states for which the relative entropy of entanglement $ e_r$ is additive , the rains bound is equal to $ e_r$.
