we are interested in assigning a pre - specified number of nodes as leaders in order to minimize the mean - square deviation from consensus in stochastically forced networks . this problem arises in several applications including control of vehicular formations and localization in sensor networks . for networks with leaders subject to noise , we show that the boolean constraints ( a node is either a leader or it is not ) are the only source of nonconvexity . by relaxing these constraints to their convex hull we obtain a lower bound on the global optimal value . we also use a simple but efficient greedy algorithm to identify leaders and to compute an upper bound . for networks with leaders that perfectly follow their desired trajectories , we identify an additional source of nonconvexity in the form of a rank constraint . removal of the rank constraint and relaxation of the boolean constraints yields a semidefinite program for which we develop a customized algorithm well - suited for large networks . several examples ranging from regular lattices to random graphs are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed algorithms .
