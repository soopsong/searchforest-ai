we study the phenomenon of entanglement extraction from the vacuum of a massless scalar field in $ ( 1 + 1)$ dimensional spacetime in presence of a moving dirichlet boundary condition , i.e. mirror spacetime , using two inertial unruh - dewitt detectors . we consider a variety of non - trivial trajectories for these accelerating mirrors and find ( 1 ) an entanglement inhibition phenomenon similar to that recently seen for black holes , as well as ( 2 ) trajectory - independent entanglement enhancement in some regimes . we show that the qualitative result obtained is the same for both linear and derivative couplings of the detector with the field .
