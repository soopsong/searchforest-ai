we present a multiplexed quantum repeater protocol based on an ensemble of laser - cooled and trapped rubidium atoms inside an optical ring cavity . we have already demonstrated strong collective coupling in such a system and have constructed a multiplexing apparatus based on a two - dimensional acousto - optical deflector . here , we show how this system could enable a multiplexed quantum repeater using collective excitations with non - trivial spatial phase profiles ( spinwaves ) . calculated entanglement generation rates over long distances reveal that such a multiplexed ensemble - cavity platform is a promising route towards long distance quantum entanglement and networking .
