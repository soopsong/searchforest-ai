the sensitivity of laser interferometers can be pushed into regimes that enable the direct observation of quantum behaviour of mechanical oscillators . in the past , membranes with subwavelength thickness ( thin films ) have been proposed as high - mechanical - quality , low - thermal - noise oscillators . thin films from a homogenous material , however , generally show considerable light transmission accompanied by heating due to light absorption , which typically reduces the mechanical quality and limits quantum opto - mechanical experiments in particular at low temperatures . in this work , we experimentally analyze a michelson - sagnac interferometer including a translucent silicon nitride ( sin ) membrane with subwavelength thickness . we find that such an interferometer provides an operational point being optimally suited for quantum opto - mechanical experiments with translucent oscillators . in case of a balanced beam splitter of the interferometer , the membrane can be placed at a node of the electro - magnetic field , which simultaneously provides lowest absorption and optimum laser noise rejection at the signal port . we compare the optical and mechanical model of our interferometer with experimental data and confirm that the sin membrane can be coupled to a laser power of the order of one watt at 1064 nm without significantly degrading the membrane 's quality factor of the order 10 ^ 6 , at room temperature .
