we posit a geometrical description of the entanglement of purification for subregions in a holographic cft . the bulk description naturally generalizes the two - party case and leads to interesting inequalities among multi - party entanglements of purification that can be geometrically proven from the conjecture . further , we study the relationship between holographic entanglements of purification in locally - ads3 spacetimes and entanglement entropies in multi - throated wormhole geometries constructed via quotienting by isometries . in particular , we derive new holographic inequalities for geometries that are locally ads3 relating entanglements of purification for subregions and entanglement entropies in the wormhole geometries .
