we demonstrate experimentally that spontaneous parametric down - conversion in an algaas semiconductor bragg reflection waveguide can make for paired photons highly entangled in the polarization degree of freedom at the telecommunication wavelength of 1550 nm . the pairs of photons show visibility higher than 90 % in several polarization bases and violate a clauser - horne - shimony - holt bell - like inequality by more than 3 standard deviations . this represents a significant step toward the realization of efficient and versatile self pumped sources of entangled photon pairs on - chip .
