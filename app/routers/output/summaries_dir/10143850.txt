while the question ` ` how many cnot gates are needed to simulate an arbitrary two - qubit operator ' ' has been conclusively answered -- three are necessary and sufficient -- previous work on this topic assumes that one wants to simulate a given unitary operator up to global phase . however , in many practical cases additional degrees of freedom are allowed . for example , if the computation is to be followed by a given projective measurement , many dissimilar operators achieve the same output distributions on all input states . alternatively , if it is known that the input state is |0 > , the action of the given operator on all orthogonal states is immaterial . in such cases , we say that the unitary operator is incompletely specified ; in this work , we take up the practical challenge of satisfying a given specification with the smallest possible circuit . in particular , we identify cases in which such operators can be implemented using fewer quantum gates than are required for generic completely specified operators .
