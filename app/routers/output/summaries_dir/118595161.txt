we review our recent progress in the production and characterization of tapered optical fibers with a sub - wavelength diameter waist . such fibers exhibit a pronounced evanescent field and are therefore a useful tool for highly sensitive evanescent wave spectroscopy of adsorbates on the fiber waist or of the medium surrounding . we use a carefully designed flame pulling process that allows us to realize preset fiber diameter profiles . in order to determine the waist diameter and to verify the fiber profile , we employ scanning electron microscope measurements and a novel accurate in situ optical method based on harmonic generation . we use our fibers for linear and non - linear absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy of surface - adsorbed organic molecules and investigate their agglomeration dynamics . furthermore , we apply our spectroscopic method to quantum dots on the surface of the fiber waist and to caesium vapor surrounding the fiber . finally , towards dispersive measurements , we present our first results on building and testing a single - fiber bi - modal interferometer .
