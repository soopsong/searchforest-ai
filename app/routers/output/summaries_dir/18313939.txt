this is a continuation of the preceding paper ( hep - ph/0108219 ) . first of all we make a brief review of generalized coherent states based on lie algebra su(1,1 ) and prove that the resolution of unity can be obtained by the curvature form of some bundle . next for a set of generalized coherent states we define a universal bundle over the infinite - dimensional grassmann manifold and construct the pull - back bundle making use of a projector from the parameter space to this grassmann one . we mainly study chern characters of these bundles . although the chern characters in the infinite - dimensional case are in general not easy to calculate , we can perform them for the special cases . in this paper we report our calculations and propose some problems .
