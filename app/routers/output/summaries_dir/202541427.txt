we demonstrate the emergence of a time crystal of atoms in a high - finesse optical cavity driven by a phase - modulated transverse pump field , resulting in a shaken lattice . this shaken system exhibits macroscopic oscillations in the number of cavity photons and order parameters at noninteger multiples of the driving period , which signals the appearance of an incommensurate time crystal . the subharmonic oscillatory motion corresponds to dynamical switching between symmetry - broken states , which are nonequilibrium bond ordered density wave states . employing a semiclassical phase - space representation for the driven - dissipative quantum dynamics , we confirm the rigidity and persistence of the time crystalline phase . we identify experimentally relevant parameter regimes for which the time crystal phase is long - lived , and map out the dynamical phase diagram . we compare and contrast the incommensurate time crystal with the commensurate dicke time crystal in the amplitude - modulated case .
