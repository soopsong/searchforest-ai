in a recent work [ d. k. burgarth et al . , nat . commun . 5 , 5173 ( 2014 ) ] it was shown that a series of frequent measurements can project the dynamics of a quantum system onto a subspace in which the dynamics can be more complex . in this subspace even full controllability can be achieved , although the controllability over the system before the projection is very poor since the control hamiltonians commute with each other . we can also think of the opposite : any hamiltonians of a quantum system , which are in general noncommutative with each other , can be made commutative by embedding them in an extended hilbert space , and thus the dynamics in the extended space becomes trivial and simple . this idea of making noncommutative hamiltonians commutative is called"hamiltonian purification . "the original noncommutative hamiltonians are recovered by projecting the system back onto the original hilbert space through frequent measurements . here we generalize this idea to open - system dynamics by presenting a simple construction to make lindbladians , as well as hamiltonians , commutative on a larger space with an auxiliary system . we show that the original dynamics can be recovered through frequently measuring the auxiliary system in a non - selective way . moreover , we provide a universal pair of lindbladians which describes an"accessible"open quantum system for generic system sizes . this allows us to conclude that through a series of frequent non - selective measurements a nonaccessible open quantum system generally becomes accessible . this sheds further light on the role of measurement backaction on the control of quantum systems .
