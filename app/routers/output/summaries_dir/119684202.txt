changes of some unitarily invariant norms and anti - norms under the operation of partial trace are examined . the norms considered form a two - parametric family , including both the ky fan and schatten norms as particular cases . the obtained results concern operators acting on the tensor product of two finite - dimensional hilbert spaces . for any such operator , we obtain upper bounds on norms of its partial trace in terms of the corresponding dimensionality and norms of this operator . similar inequalities , but in the opposite direction , are obtained for certain anti - norms of positive matrices . through the stinespring representation , the results are put in the context of trace - preserving completely positive maps . we also derive inequalities between the unified entropies of a composite quantum system and one of its subsystems , where traced - out dimensionality is involved as well .
