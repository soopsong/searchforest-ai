we show how the squeezing of light can lead to the formation of topological states . such states are characterized by non - trivial chern numbers , and exhibit protected edge modes which give rise to chiral elastic and inelastic photon transport . these topological bosonic states are not equivalent to their fermionic ( topological superconductor ) counterparts and can not be mapped by a local transformation onto topological states found in particle - conserving models . they thus represent a new type of topological system . we study this physics in detail in the case of a kagome lattice model , and discuss possible realizations using nonlinear photonic crystals or superconducting circuits .
