we report a free - space entanglement - based quantum key distribution experiment , implementing the biased basis protocol between two sites which are 15.3 km apart . photon pairs from a polarization - entangled source are distributed through two 7.8-km free - space optical links . an optimal bias 20:80 between the x and z basis is used . a post - processing scheme with finite - key analysis is applied to extract the final secure key . after three - hour continuous operation at night , a 4293-bit secure key is obtained , with a final key rate of 0.124 bit per raw key bit which increases the final key rate by 14.8 % comparing to the standard bb84 case . our results experimentally demonstrate that the efficient bb84 protocol , which increases key generation efficiency by biasing alice and bob 's basis choices , is potentially useful for the ground - satellite quantum communication .
