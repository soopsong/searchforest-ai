is the closest product state to a symmetric entangled multiparticle state also symmetric ? this question has appeared in the recent literature concerning the geometric measure of entanglement . first , we show that a positive answer can be derived from results concerning symmetric multilinear forms and homogeneous polynomials , implying that the closest product state can be chosen to be symmetric . we then prove the stronger result that the closest product state to any symmetric multiparticle quantum state is necessarily symmetric . moreover , we discuss generalizations of our result and the case of translationally invariant states , which can occur in spin models .
