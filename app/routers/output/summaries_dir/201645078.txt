in this paper , we eliminate the classical outer learning loop of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm ( qaoa ) and present a strategy to find good parameters for qaoa based on topological arguments of the problem graph and tensor network techniques . starting from the observation of the concentration of control parameters of qaoa , we find a way to classically infer parameters which scales polynomially in the number of qubits and exponentially with the depth of the circuit . using this strategy , the quantum processing unit ( qpu ) is only needed to infer the final state of qaoa . this method paves the way for a variation - free version of qaoa and makes qaoa more practical for applications on nisq devices . moreover , we show the applicability of our method beyond the scope of qaoa , in improving schedules for quantum annealing .
