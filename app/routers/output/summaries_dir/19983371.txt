we study the electromagnetic response of two- and quasi - two - dimensional hyperbolic materials , on which a simple dipole source can excite a well - confined and tunable surface plasmon polariton ( spp ) . the analysis is based on the green 's function for an anisotropic two - dimensional surface , which nominally requires the evaluation of a two - dimensional sommerfeld integral . we show that for the spp contribution this integral can be evaluated efficiently in a mixed continuous - discrete form as a continuous spectrum contribution ( branch cut integral ) of a residue term , in distinction to the isotropic case , where the spp is simply given as a discrete residue term . the regime of strong spp excitation is discussed , and complex - plane singularities are identified , leading to physical insight into the excited spp . we also present a stationary phase solution valid for large radial distances . examples are presented using graphene strips to form a hyperbolic metasurface , and thin - film black phosphorus . the green 's function and complex - plane analysis developed allows for the exploration of hyperbolic plasmons in general 2d materials .
