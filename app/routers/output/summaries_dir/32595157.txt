an incoherent control scheme for state control of locally controllable quantum systems is proposed . this scheme includes three steps : ( 1 ) amplitude amplification of the initial state by a suitable unitary transformation , ( 2 ) projective measurement on the amplified state , and ( 3 ) final optimization by a unitary controlled transformation . the first step increases the amplitudes of some desired eigenstates and the corresponding probability of observing these eigenstates , the second step projects , with high probability , the amplified state into a desired eigenstate , and the last step steers this eigenstate into the target state . within this scheme , two control algorithms are presented for two classes of quantum systems . as an example , the incoherent control scheme is applied to the control of a hydrogen atom by an external field . the results support the suggestion that projective measurements can serve as an effective control and local controllability information can be used to design control laws for quantum systems . thus , this scheme establishes a subtle connection between control design and controllability analysis of quantum systems and provides an effective engineering approach for controlling quantum systems with partial controllability information .
