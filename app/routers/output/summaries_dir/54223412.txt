the possibility of immunized and improving the entanglement of accelerated systems via local filtering is discussed . the maximum bounds of entanglement depend on the dimensions of the accelerated and the filtered subsystems . if the small dimensional subsystem is accelerated and the large dimensional subsystem is filtered , one can get a long - lived entanglement . moreover , if the larger subsystem is accelerated , then by filtering any subsystem , the upper bounds of entanglement of the filtered state are larger then that for the initial states.for any accelerated subsystem , the entanglement always increases as the filter strength of the large dimensional subsystem increases .
