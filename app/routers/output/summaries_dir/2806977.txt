in this paper , we use the h2 norm associated with a communication graph to characterize the robustness of consensus to noise . in particular , we restrict our attention to trees and by systematic attention to the effect of local changes in topology , we derive a partial ordering for undirected trees according to the h2 norm . our approach for undirected trees provides a constructive method for deriving an ordering for directed trees . further , our approach suggests a decentralized manner in which trees can be rearranged in order to improve their robustness .
