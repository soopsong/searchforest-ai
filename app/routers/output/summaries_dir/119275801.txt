we develop an adiabatic formalism to study the hawking phenomenon from the perspective of unruh - dewitt detectors moving along non - stationary , non - asymptotic trajectories . when applied to geodesic trajectories , this formalism yields the following results : ( i ) though they have zero acceleration , the temperature measured by detectors on circular orbits is higher than that measured by static detectors at the same distance from the hole , and diverges on the photon sphere , ( ii ) in the near - horizon region , both outgoing and incoming modes excite infalling detectors , and , for highly bound trajectories ( e<<1 ) , the latter actually dominate the former . we confirm the apparent perception of high - temperature hawking radiation by infalling observers with e<<1 by showing that the energy flux measured by these observers diverges in the e->0 limit . we close by a discussion of the role played by spacetime curvature on near - horizon hawking radiation .
