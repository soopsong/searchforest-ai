we introduce the quantum stochastic differential equation ( qsde ) approach to exactly analyze of the response of quantum systems to a continuous - mode two - photon input . the qsde description of the two - photon process allows us to integrate the input - output analysis with the quantum network theory , and so the analytical computability of the output state of a general quantum system can be addressed within this framework . we show that the time - domain two - photon output states can be exactly calculated for a large class of quantum systems including passive linear networks , optomechanical oscillators and two - level emitter in waveguide systems . in particular , we propose to utilize the results for the exact simulation of the stimulated emission as well as the study of the scattering of two - mode photon wave packets .
