the stokes and anti - stokes components of the spectrum of resonance fluorescence of a single trapped atom , which originate from the mechanical coupling between the scattered photons and the quantized motion of the atomic center of mass , exhibit quantum correlations which are of two - mode - squeezing type . we study and demonstrate the build - up of such correlations in a specific setup , which is experimentally accessible , and where the atom acts as efficient and continuous source of epr - entangled , two - mode squeezed light .
