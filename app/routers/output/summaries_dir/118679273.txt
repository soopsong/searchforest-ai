recently , hwang et al . [ eur . phys . j. d. 61 , 785 ( 2011 ) ] and yuan et al . [ int . j. theo . phys . 50 , 2403 ( 2011 ) ] have proposed two efficient protocols of secure quantum communication using 3-qubit and 4-qubit symmetric w state respectively . these two dense coding based protocols are generalized and their efficiencies are considerably improved . simple bounds on the qubit efficiency of deterministic secure quantum communication ( dsqc ) and quantum secure direct communication ( qsdc ) protocols are obtained and it is shown that dense coding is not essential for designing of maximally efficient dsqc and qsdc protocols . this fact is used to design maximally efficient protocols of dsqc and qsdc using 3-qubit and 4-qubit w states .
