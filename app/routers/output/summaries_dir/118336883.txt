superconducting qubits coupled to electric or nanomechanical resonators display effects previously studied in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and extensions thereof . here we study a driven qubit coupled to a low - frequency tank circuit with particular emphasis on the role of dissipation . when the qubit is driven to perform rabi oscillations , with rabi frequency in resonance with the oscillator , the latter can be driven far from equilibrium . blue detuned driving leads to a population inversion in the qubit and lasing behavior of the oscillator ( " single - atom laser " ) . for red detuning the qubit cools the oscillator . this behavior persists at the symmetry point where the qubit - oscillator coupling is quadratic and decoherence effects are minimized . here the system realizes a"single - atom - two - photon laser " .
