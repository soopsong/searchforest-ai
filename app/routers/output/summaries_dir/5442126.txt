we study two dispersive regimes in the dynamics of $ n$ two - level atoms interacting with a bosonic mode for long interaction times . firstly , we analyze the dispersive multiqubit quantum rabi model for the regime in which the qubit frequencies are equal and smaller than the mode frequency , and for values of the coupling strength similar or larger than the mode frequency , namely , the deep strong coupling regime . secondly , we address an interaction that is dependent on the photon number , where the coupling strength is comparable to the geometric mean of the qubit and mode frequencies . we show that the associated dynamics is analytically tractable and provide useful frameworks with which to analyze the system behavior . in the deep strong coupling regime , we unveil the structure of unexpected resonances for specific values of the coupling , present for $ n\ge2 $ , and in the photon - number - dependent regime we demonstrate that all the nontrivial dynamical behavior occurs in the atomic degrees of freedom for a given fock state . we verify these assertions with numerical simulations of the qubit population and photon - statistic dynamics .
