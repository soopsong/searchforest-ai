identifying the nature of interactions in a quantum system is essential in understanding any physical phenomena . acquiring information on the hamiltonian can be a tough challenge in many - body systems because it generally requires access to all parts of the system . we show that if the coupling topology is known , the hamiltonian identification is indeed possible indirectly even though only a small gateway to the system is used . surprisingly , even a degenerate hamiltonian can be estimated by applying an extra field to the gateway .
