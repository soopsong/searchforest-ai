we generate 555.8 nm light with sub - mhz linewidth through the use of laser injection - locking of a semiconductor diode at 1111.6 nm , followed by frequency doubling in a resonant cavity . the integrity of the injection lock is investigated by studying an offset - beat signal between slave and master lasers , by performing spectroscopy on the $ ( 6s)^{2}$ $ ^{1}s_{0}-\,(6s6p)$ $ ^{3}p_{1}$ transition in magneto - optically trapped ytterbium , and by demonstrating additional laser cooling of $ ^{171}$yb with the 555.8 nm light . for the $ ^{1}s_{0}-$ $ ^{3}p_{1}$ spectroscopy , we confirm the linear dependence between ground state linewidth and the intensity of an off - resonant laser , namely , that used to cool yb atoms in a $ ^{1}s_{0}-$ $ ^{1}p_{1}$ magneto - optical trap . our results demonstrate the suitability of injection locked 1100 - 1130 nm laser diodes as a source for sub - mhz linewidth radiation in the yellow - green spectrum .
