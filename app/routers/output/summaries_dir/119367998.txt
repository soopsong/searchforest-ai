scattering of classical light by atomic clouds induces photon - mediated effective long - range interactions between the atoms and leads to cooperative effects even at low atomic densities . we introduce a novel simulation technique that allows us to investigate the quantum regime of the dynamics of large clouds of atoms . we show that the fluorescence spectrum of the cloud can be used to probe genuine quantum cooperative effects . signatures of these effects are the occurrence , and the scaling behavior , of additional sidebands at twice the frequency of the classical mollow sidebands , as well as an asymmetry of the mollow triplet .
