we propose a quantum experiment to measure with high precision the schwarzschild space - time parameters of the earth . the scheme can also be applied to measure distances by taking into account the curvature of the earth 's space - time . as a wave - packet of ( entangled ) light is sent from the earth to a satellite it is red - shifted and deformed due to the curvature of space - time . measurements after the propagation enable the estimation of the space - time parameters . we compare our results with the state of the art , which involves classical measurement methods , and discuss what developments are required in space - based quantum experiments to improve on the current measurement of the schwarzschild radius of the earth .
