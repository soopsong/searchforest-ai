in recent years it has been found that quantum systems can posses entanglement in equilibrium thermal states provided temperature is low enough . in the present work we explore a possibility of having entanglement in nonequilibrium stationary states . we show analytically that , in a simple one - dimensional spin chain , there is entanglement even at highest attainable energies ; that is , starting from an equilibrium state at infinite temperature , a sufficiently strong driving can induce entanglement , even in the thermodynamic limit . we also show that dissipative dephasing , on the other hand , destroys entanglement .
