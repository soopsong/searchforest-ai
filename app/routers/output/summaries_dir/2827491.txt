in this paper , we propose feedback designs for manipulating a quantum state to a target state by performing sequential measurements . in light of belavkin 's quantum feedback control theory , for a given set of ( projective or non - projective ) measurements and a given time horizon , we show that finding the measurement selection policy that maximizes the probability of successful state manipulation is an optimal control problem for a controlled markovian process . the optimal policy is markovian and can be solved by dynamical programming . numerical examples indicate that making use of feedback information significantly improves the success probability compared to classical scheme without taking feedback . we also consider other objective functionals including maximizing the expected fidelity to the target state as well as minimizing the expected arrival time . the connections and differences among these objectives are also discussed .
