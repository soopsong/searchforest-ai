the spatial search problem consists in minimizing the number of steps required to find a given site in a network , under the restriction that only oracle queries or translations to neighboring sites are allowed . we propose a quantum algorithm for the spatial search problem on a triangular lattice with n sites and torus - like boundary conditions . the proposed algortithm is a special case of the general framework for abstract search proposed by ambainis , kempe and rivosh [ akr05 ] ( akr ) and tulsi [ tulsi08 ] , applied to a triangular network . the akr - tulsi formalism was employed to show that the time complexity of the quantum search on the triangular lattice is o(sqrt(n logn ) ) .
