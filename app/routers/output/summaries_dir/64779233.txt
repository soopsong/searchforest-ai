we study single photon transport in a one - dimensional disordered lattice of three - level atoms coupled to an optical waveguide . in particular , we study atoms of \lambda - type that are capable of exhibiting electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and separately consider disorder in the atomic positions and transition frequencies . we mainly address the question of how preferential emission into waveguide modes ( chirality ) can influence the formation of spatially localized states . our work has relevance to experimental studies of cold atoms coupled to nanoscale waveguides and has possible applications to quantum communications .
