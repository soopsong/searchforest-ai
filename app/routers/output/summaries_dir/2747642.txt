the performance of nondeterministic nonlinear gates in linear optics relies on the photon counting scheme being employed and the efficiencies of the detectors in such schemes . we assess the performance of the nonlinear sign gate , which is a critical component of linear optical quantum computing , for two standard photon counting methods : the double detector array and the visible light photon counter . our analysis shows that the double detector array is insufficient to provide the photon counting capability for effective nondeterministic nonlinear transformations , and we determine the gate fidelity for both photon counting methods as a function of detector efficiencies .
