in his original derivation , hawking showed that a schwarzschild black hole is unstable at quantum level and it evolves to a final thermal mixed state violating unitarity . there are some attempts to solve this information paradox based on a high energy surface located at the black hole event horizon : the firewall . in the wake of these proposals , we here propose the singularity itself as a"firepoint"capable to break the entanglement between the"int"and the"out"states created through the hawking process . in this paper the singularity takes active part in the information paradox in two similar ways . in the first way , the singularity , coming in contact with the the"int"state , produces a pure state outside the horizon , but it violates causality allowing people inside the black hole to send signals to the outside . the second way consists of a map that breaks the entanglement between the interior and exterior of the black hole still using the singularity yet without violating causality . the monogamy theorem is not violated whether in the first where the"out"radiation state is rendered pure directly or in the second way where the page idea is made possible again to solve the information loss problem .
