we demonstrate an experimental realization of remote state preparation via the quantum teleportation algorithm , using an entangled photon pair in the polarization degree of freedom as the quantum resource . the input state is encoded on the path of one of the photons from the pair . the improved experimental scheme allows us to control the preparation and teleportation of a state over the entire bloch sphere with a resolution of the degree of mixture given by the coherence length of the photon pair . both the preparation of the input state and the implementation of the quantum gates are performed in a pair of chained displaced sagnac interferometers , which contribute to the overall robustness of the setup . an average fidelity above 0.9 is obtained for the remote state preparation process . this scheme allows for a prepared state to be transmitted on every repetition of the experiment , thus giving an intrinsic success probability of 1 .
