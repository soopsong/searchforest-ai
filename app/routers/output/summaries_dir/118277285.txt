enabled by rapidly developing quantum technologies , it is possible to network quantum systems at a much larger scale in the near future . to deal with non - markovian dynamics that is prevalent in solid - state devices , we propose a general transfer function based framework for modeling linear quantum networks , in which signal flow graphs are applied to characterize the network topology by flow of quantum signals . we define a noncommutative ring $ \mathbb{d}$ and use its elements to construct hamiltonians , transformations and transfer functions for both active and passive systems . the signal flow graph obtained for direct and indirect coherent quantum feedback systems clearly show the feedback loop via bidirectional signal flows . importantly , the transfer function from input to output field is derived for non - markovian quantum systems with colored inputs , from which the markovian input - output relation can be easily obtained as a limiting case . moreover , the transfer function possesses a symmetry structure that is analogous to the well - know scattering transformation in \sd picture . finally , we show that these transfer functions can be integrated to build complex feedback networks via interconnections , serial products and feedback , which may include either direct or indirect coherent feedback loops , and transfer functions between quantum signal nodes can be calculated by the riegle 's matrix gain rule . the theory paves the way for modeling , analyzing and synthesizing non - markovian linear quantum feedback networks in the frequency - domain .
