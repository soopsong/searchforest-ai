do non - markovian diffusive stochastic schroedinger equations ( sses ) for open quantum systems have a physical interpretation ? in a recent paper we investigated this question using the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics . we found that the solution of a non - markovian sse at time t represents the state the system would be in at that time if a measurement was performed on the environment at that time , and yielded a particular result . however , the linking of solutions at different times to make a trajectory is , we concluded , a fiction . in this paper we show that such trajectories be interpreted using a non - standard interpretation of quantum mechanics , namely hidden variables theory . the simplest example is a non - markovian sse , which we call a position unraveling , which results from a description of the bath using bohmian mechanics . we find that the noise function z(t ) appearing in the non - markovian sse can be interpreted as a weighted sum of trajectories for the positions of the bath modes . the solution of the non - markovian sse is the state of the system ' conditioned ' on values of the bath positions . it also determines the guiding wave for these positions . we also discuss previously used unravelings which have the markovian limits of homodyne and heterodyne detection .
