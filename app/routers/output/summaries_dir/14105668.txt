we study a heterostructure which consists of a topological insulator and a superconductor with a hole . the hole pins a vortex . the system supports a robust majorana fermion state bound to the vortex core . we investigate the possibility of using scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( i ) to detect the majorana fermion in the proposed setup and ( ii ) to study excited states bound to the vortex core . the majorana fermion manifests itself as a magnetic - field dependent zero - bias anomaly of the tunneling conductance . optimal parameters for detecting majorana fermions have been obtained . in the optimal regime , the majorana fermion is separated from the excited states by a substantial gap . the number of zero - energy states equals the number of flux quanta in the hole ; thus , the strength of the zero - bias anomaly depends on the magnetic field . the lowest energy excitations bound to the core are also studied . the excited states spectrum differs from the spectrum of a typical abrikosov vortex , providing additional indirect confirmation of the majorana state observation .
