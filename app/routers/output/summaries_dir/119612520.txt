in this paper , we consider the feedback stabilization problem for n - level quantum angular momentum systems undergoing continuous - time measurements . by using stochastic and geometric control tools , we provide sufficient conditions on the feedback control law ensuring almost sure exponential convergence to a predetermined eigenstate of the measurement operator . in order to achieve these results , we establish general features of quantum trajectories which are of interest by themselves . we illustrate the results by designing a class of feedback control laws satisfying the above - mentioned conditions and finally we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through numerical simulations for three - level quantum angular momentum systems .
