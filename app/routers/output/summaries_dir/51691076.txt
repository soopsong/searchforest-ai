entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum theory and a main resource in quantum information science . ground states of quantum many - body systems with local interactions typically obey an"area law"meaning the entanglement entropy proportional to the boundary length . it is exceptional when the system is gapless , and the area law had been believed to be violated by at most a logarithm for over two decades . recent discovery of motzkin and fredkin spin chain models is striking , since these models provide significant violation of the entanglement beyond the belief , growing as a square root of the volume in spite of local interactions . although importance of intensive study of the models is undoubted to reveal novel features of quantum entanglement , it is still far from their complete understanding . in this article , we first analytically compute the renyi entropy of the motzkin and fredkin models by careful treatment of asymptotic analysis . the renyi entropy is an important quantity , since the whole spectrum of an entangled subsystem is reconstructed once the renyi entropy is known as a function of its parameter . we find non - analytic behavior of the renyi entropy with respect to the parameter , which is a novel phase transition never seen in any other spin chain studied so far . interestingly , similar behavior is seen in the renyi entropy of rokhsar - kivelson states in two - dimensions .
