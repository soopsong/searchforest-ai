we present an integrated source of polarization entangled photon pairs in the telecom regime , which is based on type ii - phasematched parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) in a ti - indiffused waveguide in periodically poled lithium niobate . the domain grating -- consisting of an interlaced bi - periodic structure -- is engineered to provide simultaneous phase - matching of two pdc processes , and enables the direct generation of non - degenerate , polarization entangled photon pairs with a brightness of $ b=7\times10 ^ 3 $ pairs/(s mw ghz ) . the spatial separation of the photon pairs is accomplished by a fiber - optical multiplexer facilitating a high compactness of the overall source . visibilities exceeding 95 % and a violation of the bell inequality with $ s=2.57\pm0.06 $ could be demonstrated .
