the holevo cram\'er rao bound is a lower bound on the sum of the mean square error of estimates for parameters of a state . we provide a method for calculating the holevo cram\'er - rao bound for estimation of quadrature mean parameters of a gaussian state by formulating the problem as a semidefinite program . in this case , the bound is tight ; it is attained by purely guassian measurements . we consider the example of a symmetric two - mode squeezed thermal state undergoing an unknown displacement on one mode . we calculate the holevo cram\'er - rao bound for joint estimation of the conjugate parameters for this displacement . the optimal measurement is different depending on whether the state is entangled or separable .
