we demonstrate the use of trapped ytterbium ions as quantum bits for quantum information processing . we implement fast , efficient state preparation and state detection of the first - order magnetic field - insensitive hyperfine levels of 171yb+ , with a measured coherence time of 2.5 seconds . the high efficiency and high fidelity of these operations is accomplished through the stabilization and frequency modulation of relevant laser sources .
