for a graph $ g$ and a related symmetric matrix $ m$ , the continuous - time quantum walk on $ g$ relative to $ m$ is defined as the unitary matrix $ u(t ) = \exp(-itm)$ , where $ t$ varies over the reals . perfect state transfer occurs between vertices $ u$ and $ v$ at time $ \tau$ if the $ ( u , v)$-entry of $ u(\tau)$ has unit magnitude . this paper studies quantum walks relative to graph laplacians . some main observations include the following closure properties for perfect state transfer : ( 1 ) if a $ n$-vertex graph has perfect state transfer at time $ \tau$ relative to the laplacian , then so does its complement if $ n\tau$ is an integer multiple of $ 2\pi$. as a corollary , the double cone over any $ m$-vertex graph has perfect state transfer relative to the laplacian if and only if $ m \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$. this was previously known for a double cone over a clique ( s. bose , a. casaccino , s. mancini , s. severini , int . j. quant . inf . , 7:11 , 2009 ) . ( 2 ) if a graph $ g$ has perfect state transfer at time $ \tau$ relative to the normalized laplacian , then so does the weak product $ g \times h$ if for any normalized laplacian eigenvalues $ \lambda$ of $ g$ and $ \mu$ of $ h$ , we have $ \mu(\lambda-1)\tau$ is an integer multiple of $ 2\pi$. as a corollary , a weak product of $ p_{3}$ with an even clique or an odd cube has perfect state transfer relative to the normalized laplacian . it was known earlier that a weak product of a circulant with odd integer eigenvalues and an even cube or a cartesian power of $ p_{3}$ has perfect state transfer relative to the adjacency matrix . as for negative results , no path with four vertices or more has antipodal perfect state transfer relative to the normalized laplacian . this almost matches the state of affairs under the adjacency matrix ( c. godsil , discrete math . , 312:1 , 2011 ) .
