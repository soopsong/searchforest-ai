recent experiments have demonstrated ququart state - independent quantum contextuality and qutrit state - dependent quantum contextuality . so far , the most basic form of quantum contextuality pointed out by kochen and specker , and bell , has eluded experimental confirmation . here we present an experimentally feasible test to observe qutrit state - independent quantum contextuality using single photons in a three - path setup . in addition , we show that if the same measurements are performed on two entangled qutrits , rather than sequentially on the same qutrit , then the noncontextual inequality becomes a bell inequality . we show that this connection also applies to other recently introduced noncontextual inequalities .
