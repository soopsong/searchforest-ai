an ingenious pulse sequence devised by s. zhang , b. h. meier , and r. r. ernst ( phys . rev . lett . { \bf 69 } , 2149 ( 1992 ) ) reverses the time evolution ( ` ` spin diffusion ' ' ) of the local polarization in a dipolar coupled $ ^{1}$h spin system . this refocusing originates a polarization echo whose amplitude attenuates by increasing the time $ t_r$ elapsed until the dynamics is reversed . different functional attenuations are found for a set of dipolar coupled systems : ferrocene , ( c$_5$h$_5$)$_2$fe , cymantrene , ( c$_5$h$_5$)mn(co)$_3 $ , and cobaltocene , ( c$_5$h$_5$)$_2$co . to control a relevant variable involved in this attenuation a pulse sequence has been devised to progressively reduce the dipolar dynamics . since it reduces the evolution of the polarization echo it is referred as repe sequence . two extreme behaviors were found while characterizing the materials : in systems with a strong source of relaxation and slow dynamics , the attenuation follows an exponential law ( cymantrene ) . in systems with a strong dipolar dynamics the attenuation is mainly gaussian . by the application of the repe sequence the characteristic time of the gaussian decay is increased until the presence of an underlying dissipative mechanism is revealed ( cobaltocene ) . for ferrocene , however , the attenuation remains gaussian within the experimental time scale . these two behaviors suggest that the many body quantum dynamics presents an extreme intrinsic instability which , in the presence of small perturbations , leads to the onset of irreversibility . this experimental conclusion is consistent with the tendencies displayed by the numerical solutions of model systems .
