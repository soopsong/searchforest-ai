quantum features of correlated optical modes define a major aspect of the nonclassicality in quantized radiation fields . however , the phase - sensitive detection of a two - mode light field is restricted to interferometric setups and local intensity measurements . even the full reconstruction of the quantum state of a single radiation mode relies on such detection layouts and the preparation of a well - defined reference light field . in this work , we establish the notion of the essential quantum correlations of two - mode light fields . it refers to those quantum correlations which are measurable by a given device , i.e. , the accessible part of a nonclassical glauber - sudarshan phase - space distribution , which does not depend on a global phase . assuming a simple four - port interferometer and photon - number - resolving detectors , we derive the reconstruction method and nonclassicality criteria based on the laplace - transformed moment - generating function of the essential quasiprobability . with this technique , we demonstrate that the essential quantum correlations of a polarization tomography scheme are observable even if the detectors are imperfect and can not truly resolve the photon statistics .
