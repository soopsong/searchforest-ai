in this paper , we theoretically propose an optomechanical scheme to explore the possibility of simulating the propagation of the collective excitations of the photon fluid in a curved spacetime . for this purpose , we introduce two theoretical models for two - dimensional photon gas in a planar optomechanical microcavity and a two - dimensional array of coupled optomechanical systems . in the reversed dissipation regime ( rdr ) of cavity optomechanics where the mechanical oscillator reaches equilibrium with its thermal reservoir much faster than the cavity modes , the mechanical degrees of freedom can adiabatically be eliminated . the adiabatic elimination of the mechanical mode provides an effective nonlinear kerr - type photon - photon interaction . using the nonlinear schr\"{o}dinger equation ( nlse ) , we show that the phase fluctuations in the two - dimensional photon fluid obey the klein - gordon equation for a massless scalar field propagating in a curved spacetime . the results reveal that the photon fluid as well as the corresponding metric can be controlled by manipulating the system parameters .
