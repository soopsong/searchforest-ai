we discuss level splitting and sideband transitions induced by a modulated coupling between a superconducting quantum circuit and a nanomechanical resonator . first , we show how to achieve an unconventional time - dependent longitudinal coupling between a flux ( transmon ) qubit and the resonator . considering a sinusoidal modulation of the coupling strength , we find that a first - order sideband transition can be split into two . moreover , under the driving of a red - detuned field , we discuss the optical response of the qubit for a resonant probe field . we show that level splitting induced by modulating this longitudinal coupling can enable two - color electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , in addition to single - color eit . in contrast to standard predictions of two - color eit in atomic systems , we apply here only a single drive ( control ) field . the monochromatic modulation of the coupling strength is equivalent to employing two eigenfrequency - tunable mechanical resonators . both drive - probe detuning for single - color eit and the distance between transparent windows for two - color eit , can be adjusted by tuning the modulation frequency of the coupling .
