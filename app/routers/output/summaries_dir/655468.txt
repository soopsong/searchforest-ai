the mathematical methods that have been used to analyze the statistical properties of boson fields , and in particular the coherence of photons in quantum optics , have their counterparts for fermi fields . the coherent states , the displacement operators , the p - representation , and the other operator expansions all possess surprisingly close fermionic analogues . these methods for describing the statistical properties of fermions are based upon a practical calculus of anti - commuting variables . they are used to calculate correlation functions and counting distributions for general systems of fermions .
