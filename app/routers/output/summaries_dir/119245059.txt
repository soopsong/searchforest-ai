the variance of difference of photocounts ( vdps ) is an established measure of quantum correlations for quantum states of light . it enables us to discriminate between the classical correlation of a two - mode coherent state and the quantum correlation of a twin - beam state . we study the effect of loss and saturation of the photon - number - resolving detector on the measurement of the vdps . an analytic function is derived for this variance , both for the coherent and the twin - beam states . it is found that the vdps is no longer a reliable entanglement measure in the nonlinear regime of the detector response but it remains useful in some range of values of average photon numbers of the incident light . we also quantify the linear regime of the detector with saturation which will be useful for calibration of the detector quantum efficiency .
