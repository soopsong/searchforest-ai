we calculate the resistance between two arbitrary grid points of several infinite lattice structures of resistors by using lattice green 's functions . the resistance for $ d$ dimensional hypercubic , rectangular , triangular and honeycomb lattices of resistors is discussed in detail . we give recurrence formulas for the resistance between arbitrary lattice points of the square lattice . for large separation between nodes we calculate the asymptotic form of the resistance for a square lattice and the finite limiting value of the resistance for a simple cubic lattice . we point out the relation between the resistance of the lattice and the van hove singularity of the tight - binding hamiltonian . our green 's function method can be applied in a straightforward manner to other types of lattice structures and can be useful didactically for introducing many concepts used in condensed matter physics .
