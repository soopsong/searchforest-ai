we report on a high - efficiency 461 nm blue light conversion from an external cavity - enhanced second - harmonic generation of a 922 nm diode laser with a quasi - phase - matched ktp crystal ( ppktp ) . by choosing a long crystal ( lc=20 mm ) and twice looser focusing ( w0=43 $ \mu$m ) than the"optimal"one , thermal lensing effects due to the blue power absorption are minimized while still maintaining near - optimal conversion efficiency . a stable blue power of 234 mw with a net conversion efficiency of eta=75 % at an input mode - matched power of 310 mw is obtained . the intra - cavity measurements of the conversion efficiency and temperature tuning bandwidth yield an accurate value d33(461 nm)=15 pm / v for ktp and provide a stringent validation of some recently published linear and thermo - optic dispersion data of ktp .
