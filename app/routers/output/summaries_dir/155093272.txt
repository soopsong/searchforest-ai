we consider the generalized hydrodynamics including the recently introduced diffusion term for an initially inhomogeneous state in the lieb - liniger model . we construct a general solution to the linearized hydrodynamics equation in terms of the eigenstates of the evolution operator and study two prototypical classes of initial states : delocalized and localized spatially . we exhibit some general features of the resulting dynamics , among them , we highlight the difference between the ballistic and diffusive evolution . the first one governs a spatial scrambling , the second , a scrambling of the quasi - particles content . we also go one step beyond the linear regime and discuss the evolution of the zero momentum mode that does not evolve in the linear regime .
