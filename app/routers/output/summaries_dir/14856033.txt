the entanglement entropy of a subsystem of a quantum system is expressed , in the replica approach , through analytic continuation with respect to n of the trace of the n - th power of the reduced density matrix . this trace can be thought of as the vacuum expectation value of a suitable observable in a system made with n independent copies of the original system . we use this property to numerically evaluate it in some two - dimensional critical systems , where it can be compared with the results of calabrese and cardy , who wrote the same quantity in terms of correlation functions of twist fields of a conformal field theory . although the two calculations match perfectly even in finite systems when the analyzed subsystem consists of a single interval , they disagree whenever the subsystem is composed of more than one connected part . the reasons of this disagreement are explained .
