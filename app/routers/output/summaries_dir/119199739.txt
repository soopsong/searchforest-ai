analogue models for gravity intend to provide a framework where matter and gravity , as well as their intertwined dynamics , emerge from degrees of freedom that have a priori nothing to do with what we call gravity or matter . bose einstein condensates ( bec ) are a natural example of analogue model since one can identify matter propagating on a ( pseudo - riemannian ) metric with collective excitations above the condensate of atoms . however , until now , a description of the"analogue gravitational dynamics"for such model was missing . we show here that in a bec system with massive quasi - particles , the gravitational dynamics can be encoded in a modified ( semi - classical ) poisson equation . in particular , gravity is of extreme short range ( characterized by the healing length ) and the cosmological constant appears from the non - condensed fraction of atoms in the quasi - particle vacuum . while some of these features make the analogue gravitational dynamics of our bec system quite different from standard newtonian gravity , we nonetheless show that it can be used to draw some interesting lessons about"emergent gravity"scenarios .
