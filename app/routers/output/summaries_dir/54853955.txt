optomechanical detectors have reached the standard quantum limit in position and force sensing where measurement backaction noise starts to be the limiting factor for the sensitivity . a strategy to circumvent measurement backaction , and surpass the standard quantum limit , has been suggested by m. tsang and c. caves in phys . rev . lett . 105 123601 ( 2010 ) . we provide a detailed analysis of this method and assess its benefits , requirements , and limitations . we conclude that a proof - of - principle demonstration based on a micro - optomechanical system is demanding , but possible . however , for parameters relevant to gravitational wave detectors the requirements for backaction evasion appear to be prohibitive .
