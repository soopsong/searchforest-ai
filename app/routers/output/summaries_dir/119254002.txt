we theoretically propose an alternative method to realize a deterministic swap gate using shortcuts to adiabatic passage based on the approach of lewis- riesenfeld invariants in cavity quantum electronic dynamics ( qed ) . by combining lewis - riesenfeld invariants with quantum zeno dynamics , the swap gate can be achieved deterministically . the strict numerical results show that our scheme is a fast and robust approach to achieve swap gate .
