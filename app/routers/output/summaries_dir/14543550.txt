we present an algorithm for building a circuit that approximates single qubit unitaries with precision { \epsilon } using o(log(1/{\epsilon } ) ) clifford and t gates and employing up to two ancillary qubits . the algorithm for computing our approximating circuit requires an average of o(log^2(1/{\epsilon})log log(1/{\epsilon } ) ) operations . we prove that the number of gates in our circuit saturates the lower bound on the number of gates required in the scenario when a constant number of ancillae are supplied , and as such , our circuits are asymptotically optimal . this results in significant improvement over the current state of the art for finding an approximation of a unitary , including the solovay - kitaev algorithm that requires o(log^{3+{\delta}}(1/{\epsilon } ) ) gates and does not use ancillae and the phase kickback approach that requires o(log^2(1/{\epsilon})log log(1/{\epsilon } ) ) gates , but uses o(log^2(1/{\epsilon } ) ) ancillae .
