we consider the use of quantum - limited mechanical force sensors to detect ultralight ( sub - mev ) dark matter candidates which are weakly coupled to the standard model . we emphasize the scalable nature of an array of sensors , which can be used to reject many backgrounds , and leads to sensitivities scaling at least as fast as $ \sqrt{n_{\rm det}}$. we show that for some ultralight dark matter candidates , a pair of milligram - scale , mechanical sensors operating at the standard quantum limit already has detection reach competitive with other quantum acceleration sensors .
