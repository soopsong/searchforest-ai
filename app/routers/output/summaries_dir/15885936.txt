we discuss the einstein energy - momentum complex and the bergmann - thomson angular momentum complex in general relativity and calculate them for space - time homogeneous goedel universes . the calculations are performed for a dust acausal model and for a scalar - field causal model . it is shown that the einstein pseudotensor is traceless , not symmetric , the gravitational energy is"density"is negative and the gravitational poynting vector vanishes . significantly , the total ( gravitational and matter ) energy"density"fro the acausal model is zero while for the casual model it is negative.the bergmann - thomson angular momentum complex does not vanish for both g\"odel models .
