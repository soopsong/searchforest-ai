coherent interconversion between optical and mechanical excitations in an optomechanical cavity can be used to engineer a quantum heat engine . this heat engine is based on an otto cycle between a cold photonic reservoir and a hot phononic reservoir [ phys . rev . lett . 112 , 150602 ( 2014 ) ] . building on our previous work , we ( i ) develop a detailed theoretical analysis of the work and the efficiency of the engine , and ( ii ) perform an investigation of the quantum thermodynamics underlying this scheme . in particular , we analyze the thermodynamic performance in both the dressed polariton picture and the original bare photon and phonon picture . finally , ( iii ) a numerical simulation is performed to derive the full evolution of the quantum optomechanical system during the otto cycle , by taking into account all relevant sources of noise .
