circularly polarized light can be obtained by using either polarization conversion or structural chirality . here we reveal a fundamentally unrelated mechanism of generating circularly polarized light using coupled nonequilibrium sources . we show that thermal emission from a compact dimer of subwavelength , anisotropic antennas can be highly circularly polarized when the antennas are at unequal temperatures . furthermore , the handedness of emitted light is flipped upon interchanging the temperatures of the antennas , thereby enabling reconfigurability of the polarization state lacked by most circularly polarized light sources . we describe the fundamental origin of this mechanism using rigorous fluctuational electrodynamic analysis and further provide practical examples for its experimental implementation . apart from the technology applications in reconfigurable devices , communication , and sensing , this work motivates new inquiries of angular - momentum - related thermal - radiation phenomena using thermal nonequilibrium , without applying magnetic field .
