it is shown that maximally efficient protocols for secure direct quantum communications can be constructed using any arbitrary orthogonal basis . this establishes that no set of quantum states ( e.g. ghz states , w states , brown states or cluster states ) has an advantage over the others , barring the relative difficulty in physical implementation . the work provides a wide choice of states for experimental realization of direct secure quantum communication protocols . we have also shown that this protocol can be generalized to a completely orthogonal state based protocol of goldenberg - vaidman ( gv ) type . the security of these protocols essentially arises from duality and monogamy of entanglement . this stands in contrast to protocols that employ non - orthogonal states , like bennett - brassard 1984 ( bb84 ) , where the security essentially comes from non - commutativity in the observable algebra .
