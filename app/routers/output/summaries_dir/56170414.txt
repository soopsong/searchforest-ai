superconducting circuits based on quantum phase - slip junctions ( qpsjs ) can conduct quantized charge pulses , which naturally resemble action potentials generated by biological neurons . a corresponding synaptic circuit , which works as a weighted connection between two neurons , can also be realized by circuits comprised of qpsjs and magnetic josephson junctions ( mjjs ) as a means of charge modulation for quantized charge propagation . in this paper , we present basic neuromorphic components such as neuron and synaptic circuits based on superconducting qpsjs and mjjs . using a spice model developed for qpsjs , neuron and synaptic circuits have been simulated in wrspice to demonstrate possible operation . we provide estimates for qpsj energy dissipation and operation speed based on calculations using simple models . the challenges for implementation of this technology are also briefly discussed .
