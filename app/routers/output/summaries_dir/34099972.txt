we give a construction for a self - test for any connected graph state . in other words , for each connected graph state we give a set of non - local correlations that can only be achieved ( quantumly ) by that particular graph state and certain local measurements . the number of correlations considered is small , being linear in the number of vertices in the graph . we also prove robustness for the test .
