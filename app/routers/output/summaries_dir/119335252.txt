modified gravity can be considered as an alternative to dark energy . in a generalized theory of gravity , the universe may accelerate while containing only baryonic and dark matter . we study , in particular , the evolution of matter fluctuations in f(r ) models within the palatini approach , and find that the resulting matter power spectrum is sensitive to a nonlinear dependence on the curvature scalar in the gravitational action . the constraints that arise from comparison to the form of the observed matter power spectrum tighten the previous constraints derived from background expansion by several orders of magnitude . models in the allowed parameter space are practically indistinguishable from general relativity with a cosmological constant when the backround expansion is considered .
