some memristors are quite interesting from the point of view of dynamical systems . when driven by narrow pulses of alternating polarities , their dynamics has a stable fixed point , which may be useful for future applications . we study the transient dynamics of two types of memristors characterized by a stable fixed point using a time - averaged evolution equation . time - averaged trajectories of the biolek window function memristor and resistor - threshold type memristor circuit ( an effective memristor ) are determined analytically , and the times of relaxation to the stable fixed point are found . our analytical results are in perfect agreement with the results of numerical simulations .
