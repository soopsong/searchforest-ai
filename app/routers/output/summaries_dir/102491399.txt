we study how to implement quantum stochastic differential equations ( qsdes ) on a quantum computer . this is illustrated by an implementation of the qsde that couples a laser driven two - level atom to the electromagnetic field in the vacuum state on the ibmqx4 tenerife computer . we compare the resulting master equation and quantum filtering equations to existing theory . in this way we characterize the performance of the computer .
