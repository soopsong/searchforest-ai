we propose two experimental schemes that can produce an arbitrary photon - number entangled state ( pnes ) in a finite dimension . this class of entangled states naturally includes non - gaussian continuous - variable ( cv ) states that may provide some practical advantages over the gaussian counterparts ( two - mode squeezed states ) . we particularly compare the entanglement characteristics of the gaussian and the non - gaussian states in view of the degree of entanglement and the einstein - podolsky - rosen correlation , and further discuss their applications to the cv teleportation and the nonlocality test . the experimental imperfection due to the on - off photodetectors with nonideal efficiency is also considered in our analysis to show the feasibility of our schemes within existing technologies .
