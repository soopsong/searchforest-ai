we study nonchiral wave functions for systems with continuous spins obtained from the conformal field theory ( cft ) of a free , massless boson . in contrast to the case of discrete spins , these can be treated as bosonic gaussian states , which allows us to efficiently compute correlations and entanglement properties both in one ( 1d ) and in two spatial dimensions ( 2d ) . in 1d , the computed entanglement entropy and spectra are in agreement with the underlying cft . furthermore , we construct a 1d parent hamiltonian with a low - energy spectrum corresponding to that of a free , massless boson . in 2d , we find edge excitations in the entanglement spectrum , although the states do not have intrinsic topological order , as revealed by a determination of the topological entanglement entropy .
