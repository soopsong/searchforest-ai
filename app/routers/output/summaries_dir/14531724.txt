we consider a quantum polynomial - time algorithm which solves the discrete logarithm problem for points on elliptic curves over $ gf(2^m)$. we improve over earlier algorithms by constructing an efficient circuit for multiplying elements of binary finite fields and by representing elliptic curve points using a technique based on projective coordinates . the depth of our proposed implementation , executable in the linear nearest neighbor ( lnn ) architecture , is $ o(m^2)$ , which is an improvement over the previous bound of $ o(m^3)$ derived assuming no architectural restrictions .
