the small photon entangling quantum system is an integrated instrument where the pump , photon pair source and detectors are combined within a single optical tray and electronics package that is no larger than 10 cm x 10 cm x 3 cm . this footprint enables the instrument to be placed onboard nanosatellites or the cubelab facility within the international space station . the first mission is to understand the different environmental conditions that may affect the operation of an entangled photon source in low earth orbit . this understanding is crucial for the construction of cost - effective entanglement based experiments that utilize nanosatellite architecture . we will discuss the challenges and lessons we have learned over three years of development and testing of the integrated optical platform and review the perspectives for future advanced experiments .
