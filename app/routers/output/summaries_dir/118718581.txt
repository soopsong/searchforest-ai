we report a ground - state solution for the two - dimensional fermionic hubbard model , which is obtained via a numerical variational method . the two ingredients in this approach are tensor network states and the time - evolving block decimation . we easily handle the horizontal hopping in the hamiltonian , and we proceed further to observe the fermion - exchange effect caused by the vertical hopping . by requiring no divergence and no convergence to zero for the ground state , we successively determine the ground - state energy per site as a function of the chemical potential and the lattice length . in addition , we observe saturation in the behavior of the ground - state energy as the lattice length increases .
