we propose a scheme to probabilistically generate greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states encoded on the path degree of freedom of three photons . these photons are totally independent from each other , having no direct interaction during the whole evolution of the protocol , which remarkably requires only linear optical devices to work , and two extra ancillary photons to mediate the correlation . the efficacy of the method , which has potential application in distribited quantum computation and multiparty quantum communication , is analyzed in comparison with similar proposals reported in the recent literature . we also discuss the main error sources that limit the efficiency of the protocol in a real experiment and some interesting aspects about the mediator photons in connection with the concept of spatial nonlocality .
