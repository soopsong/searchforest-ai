photonic integrated circuits have facilitated a drastic increase in the complexity of quantum information processing , from which near - term quantum networks can benefit . here , we report monolithically fabricated indium phosphide transmitters capable of performing measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution . we demonstrate an estimated 1kbps key rate at 100 km , with predicted distances over 350 km possible . the scheme removes detector vulnerabilities through a centralised and untrusted resource , enabling quantum - secured communication with cost - effective , mass - manufacturable devices .
