in this article we formulate frictionless atom cooling in harmonic traps as a time - optimal control problem , permitting imaginary values of the trap frequency for trasient time intervals during which the trap becomes an expulsive parabolic potential . we show that the minimum time solution has"bang - bang"form , where the frequency jumps suddenly at certain instants and then remains constant , and calculate estimates of the minimum cooling time for various numbers of such jumps . a numerical optimization method based on pseudospectral approximations is used to obtain suboptimal realistic solutions without discontinuities , which may be implemented experimentally .
