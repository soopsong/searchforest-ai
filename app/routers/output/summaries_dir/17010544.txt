we study cooling and squeezing the fluctuations of a nanomechanical beam using quantum feedback control . in our model , the nanomechanical beam is coupled to a transmission line resonator via a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) . the leakage of the electromagnetic field from the transmission line resonator is measured using homodyne detection . this measured signal is then used to design a quantum - feedback - control signal to drive the electromagnetic field in the transmission line resonator . although the control is imposed on the transmission line resonator , this quantum - feedback - control signal indirectly affects the thermal motion of the nanomechanical beam via the inductive beam - resonator coupling , making it possible to cool and squeeze the fluctuations of the beam , allowing it to approach the standard quantum limit .
