we introduce a topological quantum number -- coined dynamical topological order parameter ( dtop ) -- that is dynamically defined in the real - time evolution of a quantum many - body system and represented by a momentum space winding number of the pancharatnam geometric phase . our construction goes conceptually beyond the standard notion of topological invariants characterizing the wave - function of a system , which are constants of motion under coherent time evolution . in particular , we show that the dtop can change its integer value at discrete times where so called dynamical quantum phase transitions occur , thus serving as a dynamical analog of an order parameter . interestingly , studying quantum quenches in one - dimensional two - banded bogoliubov de gennes models , we find that the dtop is capable of resolving if the topology of the system hamiltonian has changed over the quench . furthermore , we investigate the relation of the dtop to the dynamics of the string order parameter that characterizes the topology of such systems in thermal equilibrium .
