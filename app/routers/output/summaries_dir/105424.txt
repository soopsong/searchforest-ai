we propose the theory of cayley graphs as a framework to analyse gate counts and quantum costs resulting from reversible circuit synthesis . several methods have been proposed in the reversible logic synthesis literature by considering different libraries whose gates are associated to the generating sets of certain cayley graphs . in a cayley graph , the distance between two vertices corresponds to the optimal circuit size . the lower bound for the diameter of cayley graphs is also a lower bound for the worst case for any algorithm that uses the corresponding gate library . in this paper , we study two cayley graphs on the symmetric group $ s_{2^n}$ : the first , denoted by $ i_n$ , is defined by a generating set associated to generalized toffoli gates ; and the second , the hypercube cayley graph $ h_n$ , is defined by a generating set associated to multiple - control toffoli gates . those two cayley graphs have degree $ n2^{n-1}$ and order $ 2^n!$. maslov , dueck and miller proposed a reversible circuit synthesis that we model by the cayley graph $ i_n$. we propose a synthesis algorithm based on the cayley graph $ h_n$ with upper bound of $ ( n-1)2^{n}+1 $ multiple - control toffoli gates . in addition , the diameter of the cayley graph $ h_n$ gives a lower bound of $ n2^{n-1}$.
