a genuine feature of projective quantum measurements is that they inevitably alter the mean energy of the observed system if the measured quantity does not commute with the hamiltonian . compared to the classical case , jacobs proved that this additional energetic cost leads to a stronger bound on the work extractable after a single measurement from a system initially in thermal equilibrium [ phys . rev . a 80 , 012322 ( 2009 ) ] . here , we extend this bound to a large class of feedback - driven quantum engines operating periodically and in finite time . the bound thus implies a natural definition for the efficiency of information to work conversion in such devices . for a simple model consisting of a laser - driven two - level system , we maximize the efficiency with respect to the observable whose measurement is used to control the feedback operations . we find that the optimal observable typically does not commute with the hamiltonian and hence would not be available in a classical two level system . this result reveals that periodic feedback engines operating in the quantum realm can exploit quantum coherences to enhance efficiency .
