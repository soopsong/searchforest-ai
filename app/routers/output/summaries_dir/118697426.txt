we employ the concept of a dynamical , activity order parameter to study the ising model in a transverse magnetic field coupled to a markovian bath . for a certain range of values of the spin - spin coupling , magnetic field and dissipation rate , we identify a first order dynamical phase transition between active and inactive { \em dynamical phases } . we demonstrate that dynamical phase - coexistence becomes manifest in an intermittent behavior of the bath quanta emission . moreover , we establish the connection between the dynamical order parameter that quantifies the activity , and the longitudinal magnetization that serves as static order parameter . the system we consider can be implemented in current experiments with rydberg atoms and trapped ions .
