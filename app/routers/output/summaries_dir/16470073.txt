the purpose of this paper is to extend linear systems and signals theory to include single photon quantum signals . we provide detailed results describing how quantum linear systems respond to multichannel single photon quantum signals . in particular , we characterize the class of states ( which we call { \em photon - gaussian } states ) that result when multichannel photons are input to a quantum linear system . we show that this class of quantum states is preserved by quantum linear systems . multichannel photon - gaussian states are defined via the action of certain creation and annihilation operators on gaussian states . our results show how the output states are determined from the input states through a pair of transfer function relations . we also provide equations from which output signal intensities can be computed . examples from quantum optics are provided to illustrate the results .
