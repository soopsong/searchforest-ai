spin cat states are superpositions of two or more coherent spin states ( csss ) that are distinctly separated over the bloch sphere . additionally , the nuclei with angular momenta greater than 1/2 possess a quadrupolar charge distribution . at the intersection of these two phenomena , we devise a simple scheme for generating various types of nuclear spin cat states . the native biaxial electric quadrupole interaction that is readily available in strained solid - state systems plays a key role here . however , the fact that built - in strain can not be switched off poses a challenge for the stabilization of target cat states once they are prepared . we remedy this by abruptly diverting via a single rotation pulse the state evolution to the neighborhood of the fixed points of the underlying classical hamiltonian flow . optimal process parameters are obtained as a function of electric field gradient biaxiality and nuclear spin angular momentum . the overall procedure is seen to be robust under 5 % deviations from optimal values . we show that higher level cat states with four superposed css can also be formed using three rotation pulses . finally , for open systems subject to decoherence we extract the scaling of cat state fidelity damping with respect to the spin quantum number . this reveals rates greater than the dephasing of individual csss . yet , our results affirm that these cat states can preserve their fidelities for practically useful durations under the currently attainable decoherence levels .
