measurement is one of the most counter - intuitive aspects of quantum physics . frequent measurements of a quantum system lead to quantum zeno dynamics where time evolution becomes confined to a subspace defined by the projections . however , weak measurement performed at a finite rate is also capable of locking the system into such a zeno subspace in an unconventional way : by raman - like transitions via virtual intermediate states outside this subspace , which are not forbidden . here , we extend this concept into the realm of non - hermitian dynamics by showing that the stochastic competition between measurement and a system 's own dynamics can be described by a non - hermitian hamiltonian . we obtain an analytic solution for ultracold bosons in a lattice and show that a dark state of the tunnelling operator is a steady state in which the observable 's fluctuations are zero and tunnelling is suppressed by destructive matter - wave interference . this opens a new venue of investigation beyond the canonical quantum zeno dynamics and leads to a new paradigm of competition between global measurement backaction and short - range atomic dynamics .
