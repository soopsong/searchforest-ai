we explore the spontaneous generation and decay of quantum correlations between two identical atoms coupled to a common markovian environment in the presence of electromagnetic field modes . for this purpose , we analyze the dynamics of quantum correlations by employing the concurrence , the trace quantum discord and the local quantum uncertainty , for collective dicke states . it is shown that the collective damping and dipole - dipole interaction plays a key role in enhancing non - classical correlations during the process of intrinsic decoherence . the quantum correlations can be maintained over a long time but for small distance between the two atoms .
