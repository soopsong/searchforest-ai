we study the dynamics of an inertial particle coupled to forcing , dissipation , and noise in the small mass limit . we derive an expression for the limiting ( homogenized ) joint distribution of the position and ( scaled ) velocity degrees of freedom . in particular , weak convergence of the joint distributions is established , along with a bound on the convergence rate for a wide class of expected values .
