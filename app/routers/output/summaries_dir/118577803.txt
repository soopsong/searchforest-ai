we analyze the asymptotic dynamics of quantum systems resulting from large numbers of iterations of random unitary operations . although , in general , these quantum operations can not be diagonalized it is shown that their resulting asymptotic dynamics is described by a diagonalizable superoperator . we prove that this asymptotic dynamics takes place in a typically low dimensional attractor space which is independent of the probability distribution of the unitary operations applied . this vector space is spanned by all eigenvectors of the unitary operations involved which are associated with eigenvalues of unit modulus . implications for possible asymptotic dynamics of iterated random unitary operations are presented and exemplified in an example involving random controlled - not operations acting on two qubits .
