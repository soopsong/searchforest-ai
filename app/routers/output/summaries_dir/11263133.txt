we present a scheme to couple trapped $ ^{87}$rb atoms to a superconducting flux qubit through a magnetic dipole transition . we plan to trap atoms on the evanescent wave outside an ultrathin fiber to bring the atoms to less than 10 $ \mu$m above the surface of the superconductor . this hybrid setup lends itself to probing sources of decoherence in superconducting qubits . our current plan has the intermediate goal of coupling the atoms to a superconducting lc resonator .
