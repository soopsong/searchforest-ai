we study the performance of a quantum otto cycle using a harmonic work medium and undergoing collisional dynamics with finite - size reservoirs . we span the dynamical regimes of the work strokes from strongly non - adiabatic to quasi - static conditions , and address the effects that non - markovianity of the open - system dynamics of the work medium can have on the efficiency of the thermal machine . while such efficiency never surpasses the classical upper bound valid for finite - time stochastic engines , the behaviour of the engine shows clear - cut effects induced by both the finiteness of the evolution time , and the memory - bearing character of the system - environment evolution .
