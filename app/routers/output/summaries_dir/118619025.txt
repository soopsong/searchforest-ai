lipkin - meshkov - glick model of two anisotropically interacting spins in a magnetic field is proposed as a working substance of a quantum otto engine to explore and exploit the anisotropy effects for the optimization of engine operation . three different cases for the adiabatic branches of the cycle have been considered . in the first two cases , either the magnetic field or coupling strength are changed ; while in the third case , both the magnetic field and the coupling strength are changed by the same ratio . the system parameters for which the engine can operate similar to or dramatically different from the engines of non - interacting spins or of coupled spins with ising model or isotropic xy model interactions are determined . in particular , the role of anisotropy to enhance cooperative work , and to optimize maximum work with high efficiency , as well as to operate the engine near the carnot bound are revealed .
