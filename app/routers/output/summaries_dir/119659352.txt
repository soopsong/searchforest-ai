we find that multidimensional determinants"hyperdeterminants " , related to entanglement measures ( the so - called concurrence or 3-tangle for the 2 or 3 qubits , respectively ) , are derived from a duality between entangled states and separable states . by means of the hyperdeterminant and its singularities , the single copy of multipartite pure entangled states is classified into an onion structure of every closed subset , similar to that by the local rank in the bipartite case . this reveals how inequivalent multipartite entangled classes are partially ordered under local actions . in particular , the generic entangled class of the maximal dimension , distinguished as the nonzero hyperdeterminant , does not include the maximally entangled states in bell 's inequalities in general ( e.g. , in the $ n \geq 4 $ qubits ) , contrary to the widely known bipartite or 3-qubit cases . it suggests that not only are they never locally interconvertible with the majority of multipartite entangled states , but they would have no grounds for the canonical n - partite entangled states . our classification is also useful for the mixed states .
