in this paper , we propose two quantum optomechanical arrangements that permit the dissipation - enabled generation of steady two - mode mechanical squeezed states . in the first setup , the mechanical oscillators are placed in a two - mode optical resonator while in the second setup the mechanical oscillators are located in two coupled single - mode cavities . we show analytically that for an appropriate choice of the pump parameters , the two mechanical oscillators can be driven by cavity dissipation into a stationary two - mode squeezed vacuum , provided that mechanical damping is negligible . the effect of thermal fluctuations is also investigated in detail and show that ground state pre - cooling of the oscillators in not necessary for the two - mode squeezing . these proposals can be realized in a number of optomechanical systems with current state - of - the - art experimental techniques .
