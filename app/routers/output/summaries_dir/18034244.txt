we present a source of polarization entangled photon pairs based on spontaneous parametric downconversion engineered for frequency uncorrelated telecom photon generation . our source provides photon pairs that display , simultaneously , the key properties for high - performance quantum information and fundamental quantum science tasks . specifically , the source provides for high heralding efficiency , high quantum state purity and high entangled state fidelity at the same time . among different tests we apply to our source we observe almost perfect non - classical interference between photons from independent sources with a visibility of $ ( 100\pm5)\%$.
