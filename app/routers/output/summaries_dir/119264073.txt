we theoretically consider the effect of the atomic source 's momentum width on the efficiency of bragg mirrors and beamsplitters and , more generally , on the phase sensitivity of bragg pulse atom interferometers . by numerical optimization , we show that an atomic cloud 's momentum width places a fundamental upper bound on the maximum transfer efficiency of a bragg mirror pulse , and furthermore limits the phase sensitivity of a bragg pulse atom interferometer . we quantify these momentum width effects , and precisely compute how mirror efficiencies and interferometer phase sensitivities vary as functions of bragg order and source type . our results and methodology allow for an efficient optimization of bragg pulses and the comparison of different atomic sources , and will help in the design of large momentum transfer bragg mirrors and beamsplitters for use in atom - based inertial sensors .
