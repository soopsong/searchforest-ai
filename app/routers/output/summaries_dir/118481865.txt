the author analyzes quantum computation with the hybrid qubit ( hq ) that is encoded using the three - electron configuration of a double quantum dot . all gate operations are controlled with electric signals , while the qubit remains at an optimal operation point that is insensitive to noise . an effective single - qubit description is derived , and two - qubit interactions are suggested using coulomb and exchange interactions . universal quantum control is described and numerically simulated using realistic parameters for hqs in si and gaas . high - fidelity quantum computing at the threshold of quantum error correction is possible if the coulomb interactions between the hqs stay weak .
