we study an experimental scheme to generate gaussian two - mode entangled states via beam splitter . specifically , we consider a nonclassical gaussian state ( squeezed state ) and a thermal state as two input modes , and evaluate the degree of entanglement at the output . experimental conditions to generate entangled outputs are completely identified and the critical thermal noise to destroy entanglement is analytically obtained . by doing so , we discuss the possibility to link the resistance to noise in entanglement generation with the degree of single - mode nonclassicality .
