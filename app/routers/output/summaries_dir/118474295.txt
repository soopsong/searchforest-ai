we propose an analog quantum simulator for the holstein molecular - crystal model based on a superconducting circuit qed system in the dispersive regime . by varying the driving field on the superconducting resonators , one can readily access both the adiabatic and anti - adiabatic regimes of this model . strong e - ph coupling required for small - polaron formation can also be reached . we show that small - polaron state of arbitrary quasimomentum can be generated by applying a microwave pulse to the resonators . we also show that significant squeezing in the resonator modes can be achieved in the polaron - crossover regime through a measurement - based scheme .
