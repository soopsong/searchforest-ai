we show that the bipartite logarithmic entanglement negativity ( en ) of quantum spin models obeys an area law at all nonzero temperatures . we develop numerical linked cluster ( nlc ) expansions for the ` area - law ' logarithmic entanglement negativity as a function of temperature and other parameters . for one - dimensional models the results of nlc are compared with exact diagonalization on finite systems and are found to agree very well . the nlc results are also obtained for two dimensional xxz and transverse - field ising models . in all cases , we find a sudden onset ( or sudden death ) of negativity at a finite temperature above which the negativity is zero . we use perturbation theory to develop a physical picture for this sudden onset ( or sudden death ) . the onset of en or its magnitude are insensitive to classical finite - temperature phase transitions , supporting the argument for absence of any role of quantum mechanics at such transitions . on approach to a quantum critical point at $ t=0 $ , negativity shows critical scaling in size and temperature .
