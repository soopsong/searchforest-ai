we discuss an efficient physical realization of topological quantum walks on a finite lattice . the $ n$-point lattice is realized with $ \log_2 n$ qubits , and the quantum circuit utilizes a number of quantum gates which is polynomial in the number of qubits . in a certain scaling limit , we show that a large number of steps is implemented with a number of quantum gates which is independent of the number of steps . we ran the quantum algorithm on the ibm - q five - qubit quantum computer , thus experimentally demonstrating topological features , such as boundary bound states , on a lattice with $ n=4 $ points .
