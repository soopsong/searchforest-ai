we investigate a quantum parametric amplifier with dynamical pump mode , viewed as a zero - dimensional model of hawking radiation from an evaporating black hole . the conditions are derived under which the spectrum of particles generated from vacuum fluctuations deviates from the thermal spectrum predicted for the conventional parametric amplifier . we find that significant deviations arise when the pump mode ( black hole ) has emitted nearly half of its initial energy into the signal ( hawking radiation ) and idler ( in - falling particle ) modes . as a model of black hole dynamics , this finding lends support to the view that late - time hawking radiation contains information about the quantum state of the black hole and is entangled with the black hole 's quantum gravitational degrees of freedom .
