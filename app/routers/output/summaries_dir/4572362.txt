the problem of entanglement detection for arbitrary spin systems is analyzed . we demonstrate how a single measurement of the squared total spin can probabilistically discern separable from entangled many - particle states . for achieving this goal , we construct a tripartite analogy between the degeneracy of entanglement witness eigenstates , tensor products of $ so(3)$ representations and classical lattice walks with special constraints . within this framework , degeneracies are naturally given by generalized catalan numbers and determine the fraction of states that are decidedly entangled and also known to be somewhat protected against decoherence . in addition , we introduce the concept of a"sterile entanglement witness " , which for large enough systems detects entanglement without affecting much the system 's state . we discuss when our proposed entanglement witness can be regarded as a sterile one .
