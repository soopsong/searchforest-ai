discrete time quantum walks are known to be universal for quantum computation . this has been proven by showing that they can simulate a universal quantum gate set . in this paper , we examine computation by quantum walks in terms of language acceptance , and present two ways in which discrete time quantum walks can accept some languages with certainty . these walks can take quantum as well as classical inputs , and we show that when the input is quantum , the walks can also be interpreted as performing the task of quantum state discrimination .
