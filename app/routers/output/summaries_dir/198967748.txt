solving a longstanding problem on equiangular lines , we determine , for each given fixed angle and in all sufficiently large dimensions , the maximum number of lines pairwise separated by the given angle . fix $ 0<\alpha<1$. let $ n_\alpha(d)$ denote the maximum number of lines in $ \mathbb{r}^d$ with pairwise common angle $ \arccos \alpha$. let $ k$ denote the minimum number ( if it exists ) of vertices of a graph whose adjacency matrix has spectral radius exactly $ ( 1-\alpha)/(2\alpha)$. if $ k<\infty$ , then $ n_\alpha(d ) = \lfloor k(d-1)/(k-1 ) \rfloor$ for all sufficiently large $ d$ , and otherwise $ n_\alpha(d ) = d + o(d)$. in particular , $ n_{1/(2k-1)}(d ) = \lfloor k(d-1)/(k-1 ) \rfloor$ for every integer $ k\geq 2 $ and all sufficiently large $ d$. a key ingredient is a new result in spectral graph theory : the adjacency matrix of a connected bounded degree graph has sublinear second eigenvalue multiplicity .
