we present a simple but highly efficient source of polarization - entangled photons based on spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) in bulk periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystals ( ppktp ) pumped by a 405 nm laser diode . utilizing one of the highest available nonlinear coefficients in a non - degenerate , collinear type-0 phase - matching configuration , we generate polarization entanglement via the crossed - crystal scheme and detect 0.64 million photon pair events / s / mw , while maintaining an overlap fidelity with the ideal bell state of 0.98 at a pump power of 0.025 mw .
