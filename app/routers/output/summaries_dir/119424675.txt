ever since the discovery of black hole evaporation , the region of origin of the radiated quanta has been a topic of debate . recently it was argued by giddings that the hawking quanta originate from a region well outside the black hole horizon by calculating the effective radius of a radiating body via the stefan -- boltzmann law . in this paper we try to further explore this issue and end up corroborating this claim , using both a heuristic argument and a detailed study of the stress energy tensor . we show that the hawking quanta originate from what might be called a quantum atmosphere around the black hole with energy density and fluxes of particles peaked at about $ 4m$ , running contrary to the popular belief that these originate from the ultra high energy excitations very close to the horizon . this long distance origin of hawking radiation could have a profound impact on our understanding of the information and transplanckian problems .
