we consider discrete - modulation protocols for continuous - variable quantum key distribution ( cv - qkd ) that employ a modulation constellation consisting of a finite number of coherent states and that use a homodyne - detection receiver . we establish a security proof for arbitrary collective attacks in the asymptotic regime , and we provide a formula for an achievable secret - key rate . previous works established security proofs for gaussian - modulation cv - qkd protocols or for discrete - modulation protocols with two or three coherent states . the main constituents of our approach include approximating a complex , isotropic gaussian probability distribution by a finite - size gauss - hermite constellation , applying entropic continuity bounds , and leveraging previous security proofs for gaussian - modulation protocols . as an application of our method , we calculate secret - key rates achievable over a pure - loss bosonic channel . our results indicate that in the high - loss regime the achievable key rates scale optimally , i.e. , proportional to the channel 's transmissivity , and approach that achieved by a gaussian - modulation protocol as the constellation size is increased .
