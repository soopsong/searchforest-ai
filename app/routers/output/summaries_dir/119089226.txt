quantum random number generators ( qrngs ) output genuine random numbers based upon the uncertainty principle . a qrng contains two parts in general --- a randomness source and a readout detector . how to remove detector imperfections has been one of the most important questions in practical randomness generation . we propose a simple solution , measurement - device - independent qrng , which not only removes all detector side channels but is robust against losses . in contrast to previous fully device - independent qrngs , our scheme does not require high detector efficiency or nonlocality tests . simulations show that our protocol can be implemented efficiently with a practical coherent state laser and other standard optical components . the security analysis of our qrng consists mainly of two parts : measurement tomography and randomness quantification , where several new techniques are developed to characterize the randomness associated with a positive - operator valued measure .
