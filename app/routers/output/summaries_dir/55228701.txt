results on the heating and the parametric feedback cooling of an optically trapped anisotropic nanoparticle in the laser shot noise dominant regime are presented . the related dynamical parameters , such as the oscillating frequency and shot noise heating rate , depend on the shape of the trapped particle . for an ellipsoidal particle , the ratio of the axis lengths and the overall size controls the shot noise heating rate relative to the frequency . for a particle with smaller ellipticity or bigger size , the relative heating rate for rotation tends to be smaller than that for translation indicating a better rotational cooling . for one feedback scheme , we also present results on the lowest occupation number that can be achieved as a function of the heating rate and the amount of classical uncertainty in the position measurement .
