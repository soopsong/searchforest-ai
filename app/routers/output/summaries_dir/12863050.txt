probabilistic spin logic ( psl ) is a recently proposed computing paradigm based on unstable stochastic units called probabilistic bits ( p - bits ) that can be correlated to form probabilistic circuits ( p - circuits ) . these p - circuits can be used to solve problems of optimization , inference and also to implement precise boolean functions in an"inverted"mode , where a given boolean circuit can operate in reverse to find the input combinations that are consistent with a given output . in this paper we present a scalable fpga implementation of such invertible p - circuits . we implement a"weighted"p - bit that combines stochastic units with localized memory structures . we also present a generalized tile of weighted p - bits to which a large class of problems beyond invertible boolean logic can be mapped , and how invertibility can be applied to interesting problems such as the np - complete subset sum problem by solving a small instance of this problem in hardware .
