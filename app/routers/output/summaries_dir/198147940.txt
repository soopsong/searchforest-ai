we experimentally study a nonlinear optical approach to selective manipulation and detection of structured images mixed with turbulent noise . unlike any existing adaptive - optics method by applying compensating modulation directly on the images , here we account for the turbulence indirectly , by modulating only the pump driving the nonlinear process but not the images themselves . this indirect approach eliminates any signal modulation loss or noise , while allowing more flexible and capable operations . using specifically sum frequency generation in a lithium niobate crystal , we demonstrate selective upconversion of laguerre - gaussian spatial modes mixed with turbulent noise . the extinction reaches $ \sim$40 db without turbulence , and maintains $ \sim$20 db in the presence of strong turbulence . this technique could find utilities in classical and quantum communications , compressive imaging , pattern recognition , and so on .
