we introduce a nanowire - based photonic crystal waveguide system capable of controllably mediating the photon coupling between two quantum dots which are macroscopically separated . using a rigorous green - function - based master equation approach , our two - dot system is shown to provide a wide range of interesting quantum regimes . in particular , we demonstrate the formation of long - lived entangled states and study the resonance fluorescence spectrum which contains clear signatures of the coupled quantum dot pair . depending upon the operating frequency , one can obtain a modified mollow triplet spectrum or a mollow nonuplet , namely a spectrum with nine spectral peaks . these multiple peaks are explained in the context of photon - exchange - mediated dressed states . results are robust with respect to scattering loss , and spatial filtering via propagation allows for each quantum dot 's emission to be observed individually .
