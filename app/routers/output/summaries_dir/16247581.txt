any characterization of a single - photon source is not complete without specifying its second - order degree of coherence , i.e. , its $ g^{(2)}$ function . an accurate measurement of such coherence functions commonly requires high - precision single - photon detectors , in whose absence , only time - averaged measurements are possible . it is not clear , however , how the resulting time - averaged quantities can be used to properly characterize the source . in this paper , we investigate this issue for a heralded source of single photons that relies on continuous - wave parametric down - conversion . by accounting for major shortcomings of the source and the detectors -- i.e . , the multiple - photon emissions of the source , the time resolution of photodetectors , and our chosen width of coincidence window -- our theory enables us to infer the true source properties from imperfect measurements . our theoretical results are corroborated by an experimental demonstration using a ppktp crystal pumped by a blue laser , that results in a single - photon generation rate about 1.2 millions per second per milliwatt of pump power . this work takes an important step toward the standardization of such heralded single - photon sources .
