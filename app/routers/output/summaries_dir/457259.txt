quantum key distribution ( qkd ) promises secure key agreement by using quantum mechanical systems . we argue that qkd will be an important part of future cryptographic infrastructures . it can provide long - term confidentiality for encrypted information without reliance on computational assumptions . although qkd still requires authentication to prevent man - in - the - middle attacks , it can make use of either information - theoretically secure symmetric key authentication or computationally secure public key authentication : even when using public key authentication , we argue that qkd still offers stronger security than classical key agreement .
