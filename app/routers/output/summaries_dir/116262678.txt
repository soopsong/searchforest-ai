the existence of incompatible measurements is a fundamental phenomenon having no explanation in classical physics . intuitively , one considers given measurements to be incompatible within a framework of a physical theory , if their simultaneous implementation on a single physical device is prohibited by the theory itself . in the mathematical language of quantum theory , measurements are described by povms ( positive operator valued measures ) , and given povms are by definition incompatible if they can not be obtained via coarse - graining from a single common povm ; this notion generalizes noncommutativity of projective measurements . in quantum theory , incompatibility can be regarded as a resource necessary for manifesting phenomena such as clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) bell inequality violations or einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) steering which do not have classical explanation . we define operational ways of quantifying this resource via the amount of added classical noise needed to render the measurements compatible , i.e. , useless as a resource . in analogy to entanglement measures , we generalize this idea by introducing the concept of incompatibility measure , which is monotone in local operations . in this paper , we restrict our consideration to binary measurements , which are already sufficient to explicitly demonstrate nontrivial features of the theory . in particular , we construct a family of incompatibility monotones operationally quantifying violations of certain scaled versions of the chsh bell inequality , prove that they can be computed via a semidefinite program , and show how the noise - based quantities arise as special cases . we also determine maximal violations of the new inequalities , demonstrating how tsirelson 's bound appears as a special case . the resource aspect is further motivated by simple quantum protocols where our incompatibility monotones appear as relevant figures of merit .
