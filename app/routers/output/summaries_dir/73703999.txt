we address quantum critical systems as a resource in quantum estimation and derive the ultimate quantum limits to the precision of any estimator of the coupling parameters . in particular , if l denotes the size of a system and \lambda is the relevant coupling parameters driving a quantum phase transition , we show that a precision improvement of order 1 / l may be achieved in the estimation of \lambda at the critical point compared to the non - critical case . we show that analogue results hold for temperature estimation in classical phase transitions . results are illustrated by means of a specific example involving a fermion tight - binding model with pair creation ( bcs model ) .
