we analyse a quantum otto refrigerator based on a superconducting qubit coupled to two lc - resonators each including a resistor acting as a reservoir . we find various operation regimes : nearly adiabatic ( low driving frequency ) , ideal otto cycle ( intermediate frequency ) , and non - adiabatic coherent regime ( high frequency ) . in the nearly adiabatic regime , the cooling power is quadratic in frequency , and we find substantially enhanced coefficient of performance $ \epsilon$ , as compared to that of an ideal otto cycle . quantum coherent effects lead invariably to decrease in both cooling power and $ \epsilon$ as compared to purely classical dynamics . in the non - adiabatic regime we observe strong coherent oscillations of the cooling power as a function of frequency . we investigate various driving waveforms : compared to the standard sinusoidal drive , truncated trapezoidal drive with optimized rise and dwell times yields higher cooling power and efficiency .
