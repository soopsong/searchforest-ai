there is a well - known mathematical similarity between two - dimensional classical polarization optics and two - level quantum systems , where the poincare and bloch spheres are identical mathematical structures . this analogy implies that the classical degree of polarization and quantum purity are in fact the same quantity . we make extensive use of this analogy to analyze various measures of polarization for higher dimensions proposed in the literature , in particular the $ n = 3 $ case , illustrating interesting relationships that emerge as well as the advantages of each measure . we also propose a different class of measures of entanglement based on the purity of subsystems .
