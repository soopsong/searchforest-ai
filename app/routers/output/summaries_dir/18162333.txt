suppose we can apply a given 2-qubit hamiltonian h to any ( ordered ) pair of qubits . we say h is n - universal if it can be used to approximate any unitary operation on n qubits . while it is well known that almost any 2-qubit hamiltonian is 2-universal ( deutsch , barenco , ekert 1995 ; lloyd 1995 ) , an explicit characterization of the set of non - universal 2-qubit hamiltonians has been elusive . our main result is a complete characterization of 2-non - universal 2-qubit hamiltonians . in particular , there are three ways that a 2-qubit hamiltonian h can fail to be universal : ( 1 ) h shares an eigenvector with the gate that swaps two qubits , ( 2 ) h acts on the two qubits independently ( in any of a certain family of bases ) , or ( 3 ) h has zero trace . a 2-non - universal 2-qubit hamiltonian can still be n - universal for some n>= 3 . we give some partial results on 3-universality . finally , we also show how our characterization of 2-universal hamiltonians implies the well - known result that almost any 2-qubit unitary is universal .
