a uniformly accelerated system will get thermally excited due to interactions with the vacuum fluctuations of the quantum fields . this is the unruh effect . also a system accelerated in a circular orbit will be heated , but in this case complications arise relative to the linear case . an interesting question is in what sense the real quantum effects for orbital and spin motion of a circulating electron can be viewed as a demonstration of the unruh effect . this question has been studied and debated . i review some of the basic points concerning the relation to the unruh effect , and in particular look at how the electron can be viewed as a thermometer or detector that probes thermal and other properties of the vacuum state in the accelerated frame .
