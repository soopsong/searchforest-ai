quantum repeaters create long - distance entanglement between quantum systems while overcoming difficulties such as the attenuation of single photons in a fiber . recently , an implementation of a repeater protocol based on single qubits in atomic ensembles and linear optics has been proposed [ nature 414 , 413 ( 2001 ) ] . motivated by rapid experimental progress towards implementing that protocol , here we develop a more efficient scheme compatible with active purification of arbitrary errors . using similar resources as the earlier protocol , our approach intrinsically purifies leakage out of the logical subspace and all errors within the logical subspace , leading to greatly improved performance in the presence of experimental inefficiencies . our analysis indicates that our scheme could generate approximately one pair per 3 minutes over 1280 km distance with fidelity ( f>78 % ) sufficient to violate bell 's inequality .
