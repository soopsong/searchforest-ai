we discuss the necessary conditions for a two - level system in the presence of an isotropic band edge to be transparent to a probe laser field . the two - level atom is transparent whenever it is coupled to a reservoir constituted of two parts - a flat and a non - flat density of modes representing a pbg structure . a proposal on the reconstruction of the band edge profile from the experimentally measured susceptibility is also presented .
