we consider a hypothesis in which classical space - time emerges from information exchange ( interactions ) between quantum fluctuations in the gravity theory . in this picture , a line element would arise as a statistical average of how frequently particles interact , through an individual rate $ dt\sim 1 / f_t$ and spatially interconnecting rates $ dl\sim c / f$. the question is if space - time can be modelled consistently in this way . the ansatz would be opposite to the standard treatment of space - time as insensitive to altered physics at event horizons ( disrupted propagation of information ) but by extension relate to the connection of space - time to entanglement ( interactions ) through the gauge / gravity duality . we make a first , rough analysis of the implications this type of quantization would have on the classical structure of flat space - time , and of what would be required of the interactions . seeing no obvious reason for why the origin would be unrealistic , we comment on expected effects in the presence of curvature .
