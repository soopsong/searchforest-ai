we investigate coherent single surface - plasmon transport in a metal nanowire strongly coupled to two colloidal quantum dots . analytical expressions are obtained for the transmission and reflection coefficients by solving the corresponding eigenvalue equation . remote entanglement of the wave functions of the two quantum dots can be created if the inter - dot distance is equal to a multiple half - wavelength of the surface plasmon . furthermore , by applying classical laser pulses to the quantum dots , the entangled states can be stored in metastable states which are decoupled from the surface plasmons .
