the purpose of this paper is to study the problem of generalizing the belavkin - kalman filter to the case where the classical measurement signal is replaced by a fully quantum non - commutative output signal . we formulate a least mean squares estimation problem that involves a non - commutative system as the filter processing the non - commutative output signal . we solve this estimation problem within the framework of non - commutative probability . also , we find the necessary and sufficient conditions which make these non - commutative estimators physically realizable . these conditions are restrictive in practice .
