asymmetric steering is an effect whereby an inseparable bipartite system can be found to be described by either quantum mechanics or local hidden variable theories depending on which one of alice or bob makes the required measurements . we show that , even with an inseparable bipartite system , situations can arise where gaussian measurements on one half are not sufficient to answer the fundamental question of which theory gives an adequate description and the whole system must be considered . this phenomenon is possible because of an asymmetry in the definition of the original einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox and in this article we show theoretically that it may be demonstrated , at least in the case where alice and bob can only make gaussian measurements , using the intracavity nonlinear coupler .
