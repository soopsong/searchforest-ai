the boson sampling problem has brought a lot of attention in the quantum information field because it is not efficiently solvable with a classical computer ; nonetheless it can be implemented with linear optical interferometers with single - boson sources . recently , we introduced a more general problem , the multi - boson correlation sampling problem , which allows us to take advantage of the multi - mode spectral distribution of the bosonic sources together with time - correlated measurements in order to achieve sampling not only over the output ports of the interferometer but also over the joint detection times . this problem was analyzed for both single - photon sources and thermal sources . in this work , we demonstrate that it is possible to use single qubit bosonic sources in order to sample not only over the described"space - time"degree of freedom but also over all the possible exponential number of multi - qubit output states .
