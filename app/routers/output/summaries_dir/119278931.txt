we elaborate on a previous proposal by hartman and maldacena on a tensor network which accounts for the scaling of the entanglement entropy in a system at a finite temperature . in this construction , the ordinary entanglement renormalization flow given by the class of tensor networks known as the multi scale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) , is supplemented by an additional entanglement structure at the length scale fixed by the temperature . the network comprises two copies of a mera circuit with a fixed number of layers and a pure matrix product state which joins both copies by entangling the infrared degrees of freedom of both mera networks . the entanglement distribution within this bridge state defines reduced density operators on both sides which cause analogous effects to the presence of a black hole horizon when computing the entanglement entropy at finite temperature in the ads / cft correspondence . the entanglement and correlations during the thermalization process of a system after a quantum quench are also analyzed . to this end , a full tensor network representation of the action of local unitary operations on the bridge state is proposed . this amounts to a tensor network which grows in size by adding succesive layers of bridge states . finally , we discuss on the holographic interpretation of the tensor network through a notion of distance within the network which emerges from its entanglement distribution .
