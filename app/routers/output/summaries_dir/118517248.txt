the technological world is in the midst of a quantum computing and quantum information revolution . since richard feynman 's famous"plenty of room at the bottom"lecture , hinting at the notion of novel devices employing quantum mechanics , the quantum information community has taken gigantic strides in understanding the potential applications of a quantum computer and laid the foundational requirements for building one . we believe that the next significant step will be to demonstrate a quantum memory , in which a system of interacting qubits stores an encoded logical qubit state longer than the incorporated parts . here , we describe the important route towards a logical memory with superconducting qubits , employing a rotated version of the surface code . the current status of technology with regards to interconnected superconducting - qubit networks will be described and near - term areas of focus to improve devices will be identified . overall , the progress in this exciting field has been astounding , but we are at an important turning point where it will be critical to incorporate engineering solutions with quantum architectural considerations , laying the foundation towards scalable fault - tolerant quantum computers in the near future .
