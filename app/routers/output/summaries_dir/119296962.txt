the recovery of classical chaotic dynamics from quantum systems has long been a subject of interest . furthermore , recent work indicates that quantum chaos may well be significant in quantum information processing . in this paper we discuss the quantum to classical crossover of a superconducting quantum inference device ( squid ) ring . such devices comprise of thick superconducting loop enclosing a josephson weak link . these devices are currently strong candidates for many applications in quantum technologies . the weak link brings with it a non - linearity such that semi - classical models of this system can exhibit chaotic dynamics . for many similar systems an application of the correspondence principle together with the inclusion of environmental degrees of freedom through a quantum trajectories approach can be used to effectively recover classical dynamics . here we show ( i ) that the standard expression of the correspondence principle is incompatible with the ring hamiltonian and we present a more pragmatic and general expression which finds application here and ( ii ) that practical limitations to circuit parameters of the squid ring prevent arbitrarily accurate recovery of classical chaotic dynamics .
