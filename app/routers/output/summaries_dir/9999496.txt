spin systems controlled and probed by magnetic resonance have been valuable for testing the ideas of quantum control and quantum error correction . this paper introduces an x - band pulsed electron spin resonance spectrometer designed for high - fidelity coherent control of electron spins , including a loop - gap resonator for sub - millimeter sized samples with a control bandwidth ~ 40 mhz . universal control is achieved by a single - sideband upconversion technique with an i - q modulator and a 1.2 gs / s arbitrary waveform generator . a single qubit randomized benchmarking protocol quantifies the average errors of clifford gates implemented by simple gaussian pulses , using a sample of gamma - irradiated quartz . improvements in unitary gate fidelity are achieved through phase transient correction and hardware optimization . a preparation pulse sequence that selects spin packets in a narrowed distribution of static fields confirms that inhomogeneous dephasing ( 1 / t2 * ) is the dominant source of gate error . the best average fidelity over the clifford gates obtained here is 99.2 % , which serves as a benchmark to compare with other technologies .
