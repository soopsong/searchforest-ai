separability conditions for a bipartite quantum system of finite - dimensional subsystems are formulated in terms of r\'{e}nyi and tsallis entropies . entropic uncertainty relations often lead to entanglement criteria . we propose new approach based on the convolution of discrete probability distributions . measurements on a total system are constructed of local ones according to the convolution scheme . separability conditions are derived on the base of uncertainty relations of the maassen - uffink type as well as majorization relations . on each of subsystems , we use a pair of sets of subnormalized vectors that form rank - one povms . we also obtain entropic separability conditions for local measurements with a special structure , such as mutually unbiased bases and symmetric informationally complete measurements . the relevance of the derived separability conditions is demonstrated with several examples .
