a general phase reduction method for a network of coupled dynamical elements exhibiting collective oscillations , which is applicable to arbitrary networks of heterogeneous dynamical elements , is developed . a set of coupled adjoint equations for phase sensitivity functions , which characterize phase response of the collective oscillation to small perturbations applied to individual elements , is derived . using the phase sensitivity functions , collective oscillation of the network under weak perturbation can be described approximately by a one - dimensional phase equation . as an example , mutual synchronization between a pair of collectively oscillating networks of excitable and oscillatory fitzhugh - nagumo elements with random coupling is studied .
