we present a constructive method to create quantum circuits that implement oracles $ |x\rangle|y\rangle|0\rangle^k \mapsto |x\rangle|y \oplus f(x)\rangle|0\rangle^k$ for $ n$-variable boolean functions $ f$ with low $ t$-count . in our method $ f$ is given as a 2-regular boolean logic network over the gate basis $ \{\land , \oplus , 1\}$. our construction leads to circuits with a $ t$-count that is at most four times the number of and nodes in the network . in addition , we propose a sat - based method that allows us to trade qubits for $ t$ gates , and explore the space / complexity trade - off of quantum circuits . our constructive method suggests a new upper bound for the number of $ t$ gates and ancilla qubits based on the multiplicative complexity $ c_\land(f)$ of the oracle function $ f$ , which is the minimum number of and gates that is required to realize $ f$ over the gate basis $ \{\land , \oplus , 1\}$. there exists a quantum circuit computing $ f$ with at most $ 4 c_\land(f)$ $ t$ gates using $ k = c_\land(f)$ ancillae . results known for the multiplicative complexity of boolean functions can be transferred . we verify our method by comparing it to different state - of - the - art compilers . finally , we present our synthesis results for boolean functions used in quantum cryptoanalysis .
