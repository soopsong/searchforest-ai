we study stochastic processes in which the trajectories are constrained so that the process realises a large deviation of the unconstrained process . in particular we consider stochastic bridges and the question of inequivalence of path ensembles between the microcanonical ensemble , in which the end points of the trajectory are constrained , and the canonical or s ensemble in which a bias or tilt is introduced into the process . we show how ensemble inequivalence can be manifested by the phenomenon of temporal condensation in which the large deviation is realised in a vanishing fraction of the duration ( for long durations ) . for diffusion processes we find that condensation happens whenever the process is subject to a confining potential , such as for the ornstein - uhlenbeck process , but not in the borderline case of dry friction in which there is partial ensemble equivalence . we also discuss continuous - space , discrete - time random walks for which in the case of a heavy tailed step - size distribution it is known that the large deviation may be achieved in a single step of the walk . finally we consider possible effects of several constraints on the process and in particular give an alternative explanation of the interaction - driven condensation in terms of constrained brownian excursions .
