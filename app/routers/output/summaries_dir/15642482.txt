trans - planckian redshifts in cosmology and outside black holes may provide windows on a hypothetical short distance cutoff on the fundamental degrees of freedom . in cosmology , such a cutoff seems to require a growing hilbert space , but for black holes , unruh 's sonic analogy has given rise to both field theoretic and lattice models demonstrating how such a cutoff in a fixed hilbert space might be compatible with a low energy effective quantum field theory of the hawking effect . in the lattice case , the outgoing modes arise via a bloch oscillation from ingoing modes . a short distance cutoff on degrees of freedom is incompatible with local lorentz invariance , but may nevertheless be compatible with general covariance if the preferred frame is defined non - locally by the cosmological background . pursuing these ideas in a different direction , condensed matter analogs may eventually allow for laboratory observations of the hawking effect . this paper introduces and gives a fairly complete but brief review of the work that has been done in these areas , and tries to point the way to some future directions .
