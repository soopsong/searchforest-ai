we provide general sufficient conditions for the efficient classical simulation of quantum - optics experiments that involve inputting states to a quantum process and making measurements at the output . the first condition is based on the negativity of phase - space quasiprobability distributions ( pqds ) of the output state of the process and the output measurements ; the second one is based on the negativity of pqds of the input states , the output measurements , and the transition function associated with the process . we show that these conditions provide useful practical tools for investigating the effects of imperfections in implementations of boson sampling . in particular , we apply our formalism to boson - sampling experiments that use single - photon or spontaneous - parametric - down - conversion sources and on - off photodetectors . considering simple models for loss and noise , we show that above some threshold for the probability of random counts in the photodetectors , these boson - sampling experiments are classically simulatable . we identify mode mismatching as the major source of error contributing to random counts and suggest that this is the chief challenge for implementations of boson sampling of interesting size .
