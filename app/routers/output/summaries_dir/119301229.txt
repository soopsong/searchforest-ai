non - markovian processes have recently become a central topic in the study of open quantum systems . we realize experimentally non - markovian decoherence processes of single photons by combining time delay and evolution in a polarization - maintaining optical fiber . the experiment allows the identification of the process with strongest memory effects as well as the determination of a recently proposed measure for the degree of quantum non - markovianity based on the exchange of information between the open system and its environment . our results show that an experimental quantification of memory in quantum processes is indeed feasible which could be useful in the development of quantum memory and communication devices .
