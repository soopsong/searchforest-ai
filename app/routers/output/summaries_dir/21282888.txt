preparation of pure states on networks of quantum systems by controlled dissipative dynamics offers important advantages with respect to circuit - based schemes . unlike in continuous - time scenarios , when discrete - time dynamics are considered , dead - beat stabilization becomes possible in principle . here , we focus on pure states that can be stabilized by distributed , unsupervised dynamics in finite time on a network of quantum systems subject to realistic quasi - locality constraints . in particular , we define a class of quasi - locality notions , that we name"tree - like hypergraphs,"and show that the states that are robustly stabilizable in finite time are then unique ground states of a frustration - free , commuting quasi - local hamiltonian . a structural characterization of such states is also provided , building on a simple yet relevant example .
