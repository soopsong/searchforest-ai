the two - channel kondo impurity model realizes a local non - fermi liquid state with finite residual entropy . the competition between the two channels drives the system to an impurity quantum critical point . we show that the out - of - time - ordered ( oto ) commutator for the impurity spin reveals markedly distinct behaviour depending on the low energy impurity state . for the one channel kondo model with fermi liquid ground state , the oto commutator vanishes for late times , indicating the absence of the butterfly effect . for the two channel case , the impurity oto commutator is completely temperature independent and saturates quickly to its upper bound 1/4 , and the butterfly effect is maximally enhanced . these compare favourably to numerics on spin chain representation of the kondo model . our results imply that a large late time value of the oto commutator does not necessarily diagnose quantum chaos .
