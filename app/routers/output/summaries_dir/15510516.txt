two arbitrated quantum signature schemes , one with message recovery and the other with appendix , are proposed . the two proposed schemes need not prepare quantum entanglement states , do not require comparing qubits , only require von neumann measurement , and have a significant property that both the signatory and the receiver can share and use a long - term secret key with the arbitrator by utilizing the key together with a random number . in addition , the proposed scheme with message recovery can ensure the confidentiality of the message and achieve a higher transmission efficiency , while the proposed scheme with appendix can sign classical messages of any length by using the hash function to generate digests . therefore , the efficiency of the two proposed schemes are greatly improved . furthermore , we applies the quantum signature to quantum payment and propose an on - line quantum payment system .
