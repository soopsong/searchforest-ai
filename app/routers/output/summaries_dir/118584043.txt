the importance of integrated quantum photonics in the telecom band resides on the possibility of interfacing with the optical network infrastructure developed for classical communications . in this framework , femtosecond laser written integrated photonic circuits , already assessed for quantum information experiments in the 800 nm wavelength range , have great potentials . in fact these circuits , written in glass , can be perfectly mode - matched at telecom wavelength to the in / out coupling fibers , which is a key requirement for a low - loss processing node in future quantum optical networks . in addition , for several applications quantum photonic devices will also need to be dynamically reconfigurable . here we experimentally demonstrate the high performance of femtosecond laser written photonic circuits for quantum experiments in the telecom band and we show the use of thermal shifters , also fabricated by the same femtosecond laser , to accurately tune them . state - of - the - art manipulation of single and two - photon states is demonstrated , with fringe visibilities greater than 95 % . this opens the way to the realization of reconfigurable quantum photonic circuits on this technological platform .
