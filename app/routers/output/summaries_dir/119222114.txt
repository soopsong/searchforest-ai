we employ the filter - design perspective and derive the filter functions according to nested uhrig dynamical decoupling ( nudd ) and symmetric dynamical decoupling ( sdd ) in the pure - dephasing spin - boson model with n qubits . the performances of nudd and sdd are discussed in detail for a two - qubit system . the analysis shows that ( i ) sdd outperforms nudd for the bath with a soft cutoff while nudd approaches sdd as the cutoff becomes harder ; ( ii ) if the qubits are coupled to a common reservoir , sdd helps to protect the decoherence - free subspace while nudd destroys it ; ( iii ) when the the imperfect control pulses with finite width are considered , nudd is affected in both the high - fidelity regime and coherence time regime while sdd is affected in the coherence time regime only .
