entanglement is a unique resource for quantum - enhanced applications . when employed in sensing , shared entanglement between distributed quantum sensors enables a substantial gain in the measurement sensitivity in estimating global parameters of the quantum sensor network . loss incurred in the distribution of entanglement , however , quickly dissipates the measurement - sensitivity advantage enjoyed by the entangled quantum sensors over sensors supplied with local quantum resources . here , we present a viable approach to overcome the entanglement - distribution loss and show that the measurement sensitivity enabled by entangled quantum sensors beat that afforded by the optimum local resource . our approach relies on noiseless linear amplifiers ( nlas ) to serve as quantum repeaters . we show that unlike the outstanding challenge of building quantum repeaters to suppress the repeaterless bound for quantum key distribution , nla - based quantum repeaters for distributed quantum sensing are realizable by available technology . as such , distributed quantum sensing would become the first application instance that benefits from quantum repeaters .
