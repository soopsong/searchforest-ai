a filtering problem for a class of quantum systems disturbed by a classical stochastic process is investigated in this paper . the classical disturbance process , which is assumed to be described by a linear stochastic differential equation , is modeled by a quantum cavity model . then the hybrid quantum - classical system is described by a combined quantum system consisting of two quantum cavity subsystems . quantum filtering theory and a quantum extended kalman filter method are employed to estimate the states of the combined quantum system . an estimate of the classical stochastic process is derived from the estimate of the combined quantum system . the effectiveness and performance of the proposed methods are illustrated by numerical results .
