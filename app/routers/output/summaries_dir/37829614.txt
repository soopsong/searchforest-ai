we propose a method for scaling trapped ions for large - scale quantum computation and communication based on a probabilistic ion - photon mapping . deterministic quantum gates between remotely located trapped ions can be achieved through detection of spontaneously - emitted photons , accompanied by the local coulomb interaction between neighboring ions . we discuss gate speeds and tolerance to experimental noise for different probabilistic entanglement schemes .
