asymmetric quantum error - correcting codes ( aqcs ) may offer some advantage over their symmetric counterparts by providing better error - correction for the more frequent error types . the well - known css construction of $ q$-ary aqcs is extended by removing the $ \f_{q}$-linearity requirement as well as the limitation on the type of inner product used . the proposed constructions are called css - like constructions and utilize pairs of nested subfield linear codes under one of the euclidean , trace euclidean , hermitian , and trace hermitian inner products . after establishing some theoretical foundations , best - performing css - like aqcs are constructed . combining some constructions of nested pairs of classical codes and linear programming , many optimal and good pure $ q$-ary css - like codes for $ q \in { 2,3,4,5,7,8,9}$ up to reasonable lengths are found . in many instances , removing the $ \f_{q}$-linearity and using alternative inner products give us pure aqcs with improved parameters than relying solely on the standard css construction .
