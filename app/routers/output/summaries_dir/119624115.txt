the existence of a set of d^2 pairwise equiangular complex lines ( equivalently , a sic - povm ) in d - dimensional hilbert space is currently known only for a finite set of dimensions d. we prove that , if there exists a set of real units in a certain ray class field ( depending on d ) satisfying certain congruence conditions and algebraic properties , a sic - povm may be constructed when d is an odd prime congruent to 2 modulo 3 . we give an explicit analytic formula that we expect to yield such a set of units . our construction uses values of derivatives of zeta functions at s=0 and is closely connected to the stark conjectures over real quadratic fields . we verify numerically that our construction yields sic - povms in dimensions 5 , 11 , 17 , and 23 , and we give the first exact solution to the sic - povm problem in dimension 23 .
