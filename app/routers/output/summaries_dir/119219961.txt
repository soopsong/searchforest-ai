chern insulators are band insulators exhibiting a nonzero hall conductance but preserving the lattice translational symmetry . we conclusively show that a partially filled chern insulator at 1/3 filling exhibits a fractional quantum hall effect and rule out charge - density wave states that have not been ruled out by previous studies . by diagonalizing the hubbard interaction in the flat - band limit of these insulators , we show the following : the system is incompressible and has a 3-fold degenerate ground state whose momenta can be computed by postulating an generalized pauli principle with no more than 1 particle in 3 consecutive orbitals . the ground state density is constant , and equal to 1/3 in momentum space . excitations of the system are fractional statistics particles whose total counting matches that of quasiholes in the laughlin state based on the same generalized pauli principle . the entanglement spectrum of the state has a clear entanglement gap which seems to remain finite in the thermodynamic limit . the levels below the gap exhibit counting identical to that of laughlin 1/3 quasiholes . both the 3 ground states and excited states exhibit spectral flow upon flux insertion . all the properties above disappear in the trivial state of the insulator - both the many - body energy gap and the entanglement gap close at the phase transition when the single - particle hamiltonian goes from topologically nontrivial to topologically trivial . these facts clearly show that fractional many - body states are possible in topological insulators .
