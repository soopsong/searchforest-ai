in the endeavour to scale up the number of qubits in an ion - based quantum computer several groups have started to develop miniaturized ion traps for extended spatial control and manipulation of the ions . shuttling and separation of ion strings have been the foremost issues in linear - trap arrangements and some prototypes of junctions have been demonstrated for the extension of ion motion to two dimensions ( 2d ) . while junctions require complex trap structures , small extensions to the 1d motion can be accomplished in simple linear trap arrangements . here , control of the extended field in a planar , linear chip trap is used to shuttle ions in 2d . with this approach , the order of ions in a string is deterministically reversed . optimized potentials are theoretically derived and simulations show that the reordering can be carried out adiabatically . the control over individual ion positions in a linear trap presents a new tool for ion - trap quantum computing . the method is also expected to work with mixed crystals of different ion species and as such could have applications for sympathetic cooling of an ion string .
