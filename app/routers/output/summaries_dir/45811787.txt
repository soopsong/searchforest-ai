machine learning is a fascinating and exciting field within computer science . recently , this excitement has been transferred to the quantum information realm . currently , all proposals for the quantum version of machine learning utilize the finite - dimensional substrate of discrete variables . here we generalize quantum machine learning to the more complex , but still remarkably practical , infinite - dimensional systems . we present the critical subroutines of quantum machine learning algorithms for an all - photonic continuous - variable quantum computer that achieve an exponential speedup compared to their equivalent classical counterparts . finally , we also map out an experimental implementation which can be used as a blueprint for future photonic demonstrations .
