this paper considers transfer functions in consensus systems where agents have identical siso dynamics of arbitrary order . the interconnecting structure is a directed graph . the transfer functions for various inputs and outputs are presented in simple product forms with a similar structure of the numerator and the denominator . this structure combines the network properties and the agent model in an explicit way . the link between a higher - order and a single - integrator dynamics is shown and the polynomials of the transfer function in the single - integrator system are related to the graph properties . these properties also allow to generalize a result on the minimal dimension of the controllable subspace to the directed graphs .
