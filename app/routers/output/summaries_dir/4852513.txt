a new protocol for quantum broadcast channels based on the fully quantum slepian - wolf protocol is presented . the protocol yields an achievable rate region for entanglement - assisted transmission of quantum information through a quantum broadcast channel that can be considered the quantum analogue of marton 's region for classical broadcast channels . the protocol can be adapted to yield achievable rate regions for unassisted quantum communication and for entanglement - assisted classical communication ; in the case of unassisted transmission , the region we obtain has no independent constraint on the sum rate , only on the individual transmission rates . regularized versions of all three rate regions are provably optimal .
