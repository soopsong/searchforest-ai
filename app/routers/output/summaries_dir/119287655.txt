entangled states in high dimensional systems are of great interest due to the extended possibilities they provide in quantum information processing . recently , sun et al . [ phys . rev . a 82 , 052323 ( 2010 ) ] and kim et al . [ nat . phys . 8 , 117 ( 2012 ) ] pointed out that weak measurement and quantum weak measurement reversal can actively combat decoherence . we generalize their studies from qubits to qutrits under amplitude damping decoherence . we find that the qutrit - qutrit entanglement can be partially retrieved for certain initial states when only weak measurement reversals are performed . however , we can completely defeat amplitude damping decoherence for any initial states by the combination of prior weak measurements and post optimal weak measurement reversals . the experimental feasibility of our schemes is also discussed .
