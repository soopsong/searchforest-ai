as normally used , no commercially available camera has a low - enough dark noise to directly produce video recordings of double - slit interference at the photon - by - photon level , because readout noise significantly contaminates or overwhelms the signal . in this work , noise levels are significantly reduced by turning on the camera only when the presence of a photon has been heralded by the arrival , at an independent detector , of a time - correlated photon produced via parametric down - conversion . this triggering scheme provides the improvement required for direct video imaging of young 's double - slit experiment with single photons , allowing clarified versions of this foundational demonstration . further , we introduce variations on this experiment aimed at promoting discussion of the role spatial coherence plays in such a measurement . we also emphasize complementary aspects of single - photon measurement , where imaging yields ( transverse ) position information , while diffraction yields the transverse momentum , and highlight the roles of transverse position and momentum correlations between down - converted photons , including examples of"ghost"imaging and diffraction . the videos can be accessed at http://sun.iwu.edu/~gspaldin/singlephotonvideos.html online .
