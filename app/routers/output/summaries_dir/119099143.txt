levitated optomechanical systems , and particularly particles trapped in vacuum , provide unique platforms for studying the mechanical behavior of objects well - isolated from their environment . ultimately , such systems may enable the study of fundamental questions in quantum mechanics , gravity , and other weak forces . while the optical trapping of nanoparticles has emerged as the prototypical levitated optomechanical system , it is not without problems due to the heating from the high optical intensity required , particularly when combined with a high vacuum environment . here we investigate a magneto - gravitational trap in ultra - high vacuum . in contrast to optical trapping , we create an entirely passive trap for diamagnetic particles by utilizing the magnetic field generated by permanent magnets and the gravitational interaction . we demonstrate cooling the center of mass motion of a trapped silica microsphere from ambient temperature to an effective temperature near or below one millikelvin in two degrees of freedom by optical feedback damping .
