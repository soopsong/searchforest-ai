joint , or simultaneous , measurements of non - commuting observables are possible within quantum mechanics , if one accepts an increase in the variances of the jointly measured observables . in this paper , we discuss joint measurements of a spin 1/2 particle along any two directions . starting from an operational locality principle , it is shown how to obtain a bound on how sharp the joint measurement can be . we give a direct interpretation of this bound in terms of an uncertainty relation .
