simulating quantum circuits classically is an important area of research in quantum information , with applications in computational complexity and validation of quantum devices . one of the state - of - the - art simulators , that of bravyi et al , utilizes a randomized sparsification technique to approximate the output state of a quantum circuit by a stabilizer sum with a reduced number of terms . in this paper , we describe an improved monte carlo algorithm for performing randomized sparsification . this algorithm reduces the runtime of computing the approximate state by the factor $ \ell / m$ , where $ \ell$ and $ m$ are respectively the total and non - clifford gate counts . the main technique is a circuit recompilation routine based on manipulating exponentiated pauli operators . the recompilation routine also facilitates numerical search for clifford decompositions of products of gates , which can further reduce the runtime in certain cases . it may additionally lead to a framework for optimizing circuit implementations over a gate set , reducing the overhead for state - injection in fault - tolerant implementations . we provide a concise exposition of randomized sparsification , and describe how to use it to estimate circuit amplitudes in a way which can be generalized to a broader class of gates and states . this latter method can be used to obtain additive error estimates of circuit probabilities with a faster runtime than the full techniques of bravyi et al . such estimates are useful for validating near - term quantum devices provided that the target probability is not exponentially small .
