an entropic approach to formulating uncertainty relations for the number - annihilation pair is considered . we construct some normal operator that traces the annihilation operator as well as commuting quadratures with a complete system of common eigenfunctions . expanding the measured wave function with respect to them , one obtains a relevant probability distribution . another distribution is naturally generated by measuring the number operator . due to the riesz - thorin theorem , there exists a nontrivial inequality between corresponding functionals of the above distributions . we find the bound in this inequality and further derive uncertainty relations in terms of both the renyi and tsallis entropies . entropic uncertainty relations for continuous distribution as well as relations for discretized one are presented .
