we propose a feasible scheme to realize all - optical photon transmission switching in a passiveactive optomechanical system , consisting of one ordinary passive cavity , one active cavity and one common movable membrane oscillator of perfect reflection , driven by two strong control fields and two weak probe fields symmetrically . by means of the gain effect of the active cavity , many novel and valuable phenomena arise , such as frequency - independent perfect reflection ( fipr ) first proposed in this paper , adjustable photon bidirectional transmission , phase - dependent non - reciprocity and so on . the relevant parameters used for controlling the all - optical switching are precisely tunable by adjusting the strengths of control fields and the relative phase of probe fields . furthermore , tunable fast and slow light can be realized in our system by accurately adjusting relevant parameters which is readily and feasible in experiments . these novel phenomena originate from the effective optomechanical coupling and the gain effect provide a promising platform for photonic devices , quantum network node fabrication and quantum information process ( qip ) .
