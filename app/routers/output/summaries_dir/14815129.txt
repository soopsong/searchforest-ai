while the statistical and resilience properties of the internet are no more changing significantly across time , the darknet , a network devoted to keep anonymous its traffic , still experiences rapid changes to improve the security of its users . here , we study the structure of the darknet and we find that its topology is rather peculiar , being characterized by non - homogenous distribution of connections -- typical of scale - free networks -- , very short path lengths and high clustering -- typical of small - world networks -- and lack of a core of highly connected nodes . we propose a model to reproduce such features , demonstrating that the mechanisms used to improve cyber - security are responsible for the observed topology . unexpectedly , we reveal that its peculiar structure makes the darknet much more resilient than the internet -- used as a benchmark for comparison at a descriptive level -- to random failures , targeted attacks and cascade failures , as a result of adaptive changes in response to the attempts of dismantling the network across time .
