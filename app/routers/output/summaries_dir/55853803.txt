we address the problem of properly quantifying information in quantum theory . brukner and zeilinger proposed the concept of an operationally invariant measure based on measurement statistics . their measure of information is calculated with probabilities generated in a complete set of mutually complementary observations . this approach was later criticized for several reasons . we show that some critical points can be overcome by means of natural extension or reformulation of the brukner - zeilinger approach . in particular , this approach is connected with symmetric informationally complete measurements . the"total information"of brukner and zeilinger can further be treated in the context of mutually unbiased measurements as well as general symmetric informationally complete measurements . the brukner - zeilinger measure of information is also examined in the case of detection inefficiencies . it is shown to be decreasing under the action of bistochastic maps . the brukner - zeilinger total information can be used for estimating the map norm of quantum operations .
