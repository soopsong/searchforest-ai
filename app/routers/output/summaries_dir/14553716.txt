in qbism ( or quantum bayesianism ) a quantum state does not represent an element of physical reality but an agent 's personal probability assignments , reflecting his subjective degrees of belief about the future content of his experience . in this paper , we contrast qbism with hidden - variable accounts of quantum mechanics and show the sense in which qbism explains quantum correlations . qbism 's agent - centered worldview can be seen as a development of ideas expressed in schr\"odinger 's essay"nature and the greeks " .
