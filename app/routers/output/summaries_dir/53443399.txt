quantum systems can be used to measure various quantities in their environment with high precision . often , however , their sensitivity is limited by the decohering effects of this same environment . dynamical decoupling schemes are widely used to filter environmental noise from signals , but their performance is limited by the spectral properties of the signal and noise at hand . quantum error correction schemes have therefore emerged as a complementary technique without the same limitations . to date , however , they have failed to correct the dominant noise type in many quantum sensors , which couples to each qubit in a sensor in the same way as the signal . here we show how quantum error correction can correct for such noise , which dynamical decoupling can only partially address . whereas dynamical decoupling exploits temporal noise correlations in signal and noise , our scheme exploits spatial correlations . we give explicit examples in small quantum devices and demonstrate a method by which error - correcting codes can be tailored to their noise .
