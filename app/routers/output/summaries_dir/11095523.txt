the behaviors of one - dimensional quantum random walks are strikingly different from those of classical ones . however , when decoherence is involved , the limiting distributions take on many classical features over time . in this paper , we study the decoherence on both position and ` ` coin ' ' spaces of the particle . we propose a new analytical approach to investigate these phenomena and obtain the generating functions which encode all the features of these walks . specifically , from these generating functions , we find exact analytic expressions of several moments for the time and noise dependence of position . moreover , the limiting position distributions of decoherent quantum random walks are shown to be gaussian in an analytical manner . these results explicitly describe the relationship between the system and the level of decoherence .
