we investigate new features , especially of entanglement dynamics , which arise in a quantum - classical hybrid . as a model , we study the coupling between two quantum mechanical two - level systems , i.e. two q - bits , and a classical harmonic oscillator . their interaction is described by a hybrid coupling , in accordance with a recently developed quantum - classical hybrid theory . we discuss various situations in which entanglement of the q - bits does ( not ) evolve . furthermore , we point out an experimental application in a hybrid cooling scheme and indicate topics for future study .
