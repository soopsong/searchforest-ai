it was believed until recently that the verification of quantum entanglement and quantum steering , between two parties , required trust in at least one of the parties and their devices , in contrast to the verification of bell nonseparability . it has since been shown that this is not the case : the need for trust , in verifying two parties share a given quantum correlation resource , can be replaced by quantum refereeing , in which the referee sends quantum signals rather than classical signals to untrusted parties . the existence of such quantum - refereed games is discussed , with particular emphasis on how they make it impossible for the parties to cheat . the example of a particular quantum - refereed steering game is used to show explicitly how measurement - device independence is achieved via ` quantum programming ' of untrusted measurement devices ; how cheating is prevented by the steered party being unable to distinguish sufficiently well between two sets of nonorthogonal signal states ; and that cheating remains impossible when one - way communication is allowed from the steered party to the unsteered party . this game has been recently implemented experimentally , and is of particular interest both in accounting for any imperfections in the referee 's preparation of signal states , and in suggesting the future possibility of secure two - sided quantum key distribution with bell - local states .
