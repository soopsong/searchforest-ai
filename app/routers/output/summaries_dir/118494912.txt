entanglement , one of the most intriguing aspects of quantum mechanics , marks itself into different features of quantum states . for this reason different criteria can be used for verifying entanglement . in this paper we review some of the entanglement criteria casted for continuous variable states and link them to peculiar aspects of the original debate on the famous epr paradox . moreover , we give a handy expression for valuating bell - type non - locality on gaussian states . we also present the experimental measurement of a particular realization of the bell operator over continuous variable entangled states produced by a sub - threshold type - ii opo .
