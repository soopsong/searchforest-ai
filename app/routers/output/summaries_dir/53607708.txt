generative adversarial network ( gan ) is an effective machine learning framework to train unsupervised generative models , and has drawn lots of attention in recent years . in the gan framework , the generator is trained by an adversarial discriminator , in order to generate new samples that follows the probability distribution of a given training dataset . classical gans can not generate discrete data due to the requirement of differentiability on the design of generators . in this paper , we propose a quantum version of gan for generation of discrete data , which complements classical gans . our quantum gan is composed of a parameterized quantum circuit as the generator and a classical feedforward neural network as the discriminator . two families of quantum circuits , both composed of simple one - qubit rotation and two - qubit controlled - phase gates , are considered . the analytic gradient of the quantum generator can be estimated by sampling the same quantum generator , so gradient - based methods can be used in the training . the results of a small - scale proof - of - principle numerical simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of our scheme .
