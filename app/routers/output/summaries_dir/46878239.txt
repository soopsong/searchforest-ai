the knill - laflamme - milburn ( klm ) states have been proved to be a useful resource for quantum information processing [ nature 409 , 46 ( 2001 ) ] . for atomic klm states , several schemes have been put forward based on the time - dependent unitary dynamics , but the dissipative generation of these states has not been reported . this work discusses the possibility for creating different forms of bipartite klm states in neutral atom system , where the spontaneous emission of excited rydberg states , combined with the rydberg antiblockade mechanism , is actively exploited to engineer a steady klm state from an arbitrary initial state . the numerical simulation of the master equation signifies that a fidelity above 99\% is available with the current experimental parameters .
