the aim of this work is to develop a framework for realising quantum network algorithms with the use of prior knowledge about the structure of the network . we seek to obtain computational methods that allows us to locally determine network properties in a quantum superposition and drive the walk behaviour accordingly . in particular , we consider a network that consists of different types of edges , such that the transitions between nodes result in extra edge - dependent phase shift . we combine amplitude amplification and phase estimation to develop an algorithm for exploring such networks . in the layered neural network inspired case we obtain linear increase of the search complexity with exponential growth of the nodes number . we show that in consequence one is able to perform quantum search algorithms with exponential speed - up compared to quantum search that neglects the extra phase shifts .
