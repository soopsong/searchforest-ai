we revisit the notion of deniability in quantum key exchange ( qke ) , a topic that remains largely unexplored . in the only work on this subject by donald beaver , it is argued that qke is not necessarily deniable due to an eavesdropping attack that limits key equivocation . we provide more insight into the nature of this attack and how it extends to other constructions such as qke obtained from uncloneable encryption . we then adopt the framework for quantum authenticated key exchange , developed by mosca et al . , and extend it to introduce the notion of coercer - deniable qke , formalized in terms of the indistinguishability of real and fake coercer views . next , we apply results from a recent work by arrazola and scarani on covert quantum communication to establish a connection between covert qke and deniability . we propose dc - qke , a simple deniable covert qke protocol , and prove its deniability via a reduction to the security of covert qke . finally , we consider how entanglement distillation can be used to enable information - theoretically deniable protocols for qke and tasks beyond key exchange .
