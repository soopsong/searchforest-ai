we propose a quantum simulation of a two - level atom coupled to a single mode of the electromagnetic field in the ultrastrong - coupling regime based upon resonant raman transitions in an atom interacting with a high finesse optical cavity mode . we show by numerical simulation the possibility of realizing the scheme with a single rubidium atom , in which two hyperfine ground states make up the effective two - level system , and for cavity qed parameters that should be achievable with , for example , microtoroidal whispering - gallery - mode resonators . our system also enables simulation of a generalized model in which a nonlinear coupling between the atomic inversion and the cavity photon number occurs on an equal footing with the ( ultrastrong ) dipole coupling and can give rise to critical - type behavior even at the single - atom level . our model takes account of dissipation , and we pay particular attention to observables that would be readily observable in the output from the system .
