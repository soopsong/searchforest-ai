we report on spectra of circuit - quantum - electrodynamics ( qed ) systems in an intermediate regime that lies between the ultrastrong and deep - strong - coupling regimes , which have been reported previously in the literature . our experimental results , along with numerical simulations , demonstrate that as the coupling strength increases , the spectrum of a circuit - qed system undergoes multiple qualitative transformations , such that several coupling regimes are identified , each with its own unique spectral features . the different spectral transformations can be related to crossings between energy level differences and to changes in the symmetries of the energy eigenstates . these results allow us to use qualitative spectral features to infer certain properties and parameters of the system .
