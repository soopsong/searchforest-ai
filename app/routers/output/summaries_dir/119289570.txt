we introduce a kind of entangled state --- photon - addition two - mode squeezed thermal state ( tmsts ) by adding photons to each mode of the tmsts . using the p - representation of thermal state , the compact expression of the normalization factor is derived , a jacobi polynomial . the nonclassicality is investigated by exploring especially the negativity of wigner function . the entanglement is discussed by using shchukin - vogel criteria . it is shown that the photon - addtion to the tmsts may be more effective for the entanglement enhancement than the photon - subtraction from the tmsts . in addition , the quantum teleportation is also examined , which shows that symmetrical photon - added tmsts may be more useful for quantum teleportation than the non - symmetric case .
