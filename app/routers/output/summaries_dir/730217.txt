the moyal momentum algebra is , once again , used to discuss some important aspects of nc integrable models and 2d conformal field theories . among the results presented , we setup algebraic structures and makes useful convention notations leading to extract non trivial properties of the moyal momentum algebra . we study also the lax pair building mechanism for particular examples namely , the noncommutative kdv and burgers systems . we show in a crucial step that these two systems are mapped to each others through a crucial mapping . this makes a strong constraint on the nc burgers system which corresponds to linearizing its associated differential equation . from the conformal field theory point of view , this constraint equation is nothing but the analogue of the conservation law of the conformal current . we believe that this mapping might help to bring new insights towards understanding the integrability of noncommutative 2d - systems .
