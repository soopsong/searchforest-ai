we report on the theoretical investigation of wigner distribution function ( wdf ) reconstruction of the motional quantum state of large molecules in de broglie interference . de broglie interference of fullerenes and as the like already proves the wavelike behaviour of these heavy particles , while we aim to extract more quantitative information about the superposition quantum state in motion . we simulate the reconstruction of the wdf numerically based on an analytic probability distribution and investigate its properties by variation of parameters , which are relevant for the experiment . even though the wdf described in the near - field experiment can not be reconstructed completely , we observe negativity even in the partially reconstructed wdf . we further consider incoherent factors to simulate the experimental situation such as a finite number of slits , collimation , and particle - slit van der waals interaction . from this we find experimental conditions to reconstruct the wdf from talbot interference fringes in molecule talbot - lau interferometry .
