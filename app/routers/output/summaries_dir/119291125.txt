in recent work concerning the sparsity of the hawking flux [ arxiv:1506.03975v2 ] , we found it necessary to re - examine what is known regarding the greybody factors of black holes , with a view to extending and expanding on some old results from the 1970s . focussing specifically on schwarzschild black holes , we re - calculated and re - assessed the greybody factors using a path - ordered - exponential approach , a technique which has the virtue of providing a semi - explicit formula for the relevant bogoliubov coefficients . these path - ordered - exponentials , ( being based on a"transfer matrix"formalism ) , are closely related to so - called"product integrals " , leading to quite straightforward and direct numerical evaluation , while avoiding any need for numerically solving differential equations . furthermore , while considerable analytic information is already available regarding both the high - frequency and low - frequency asymptotics of these greybody factors , numerical approaches seem better adapted to finding suitable"global models"for these greybody factors in the intermediate frequency regime , where most of the hawking flux is concentrated . working in a more general context , these path - ordered - exponential techniques are also likely to be of interest for generic barrier - penetration problems .
