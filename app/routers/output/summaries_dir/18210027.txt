the grating magneto - optical trap ( gmot ) requires only one beam and three planar diffraction gratings to form a cloud of cold atoms above the plane of the diffractors . despite the complicated polarization arrangement , we demonstrate sub - doppler cooling of 87rb atoms to a temperature of 7.6(0.6 ) uk through a multi - stage , far - detuned gmot in conjunction with optical molasses . a decomposition of the electric field into polarization components for this geometry does not yield a mapping onto standard sub - doppler laser - cooling configurations . with numerical simulations , we find that the polarization composition of the gmot optical field , which includes sigma- and pi - polarized light , does produce sub - doppler temperatures .
