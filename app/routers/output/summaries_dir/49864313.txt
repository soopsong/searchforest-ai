in this paper , we address the problem of counting integer points in a rational polytope described by $ p(y ) = \ { x \in \mathbb{r}^m \colon ax = y , x \geq 0\}$ , where $ a$ is an $ n \times m$ integer matrix and $ y$ is an $ n$-dimensional integer vector . we study the z - transformation approach initiated by brion - vergne , beck , and lasserre - zeron from the numerical analysis point of view , and obtain a new algorithm on this problem : if $ a$ is nonnegative , then the number of integer points in $ p(y)$ can be computed in $ o(\mathrm{poly } ( n , m , \|y\|_\infty ) ( \|y\|_\infty + 1)^n)$ time and $ o(\mathrm{poly } ( n , m , \|y\|_\infty))$ space.this improves , in terms of space complexity , a naive dp algorithm with $ o((\|y\|_\infty + 1)^n)$-size dp table . our result is based on the standard error analysis to the numerical contour integration for the inverse z - transform , and establish a new type of an inclusion - exclusion formula for integer points in $ p(y)$. we apply our result to hypergraph $ b$-matching , and obtain a $ o(\mathrm{poly } ( n , m,\|b\|_\infty ) ( \|b\|_\infty +1)^{(1 - 1 / k)n})$ time algorithm for counting $ b$-matchings in a $ k$-partite hypergraph with $ n$ vertices and $ m$ hyperedges . this result is viewed as a $ b$-matching generalization of the classical result by ryser for $ k=2 $ and its multipartite extension by bj{\"o}rklund - husfeldt .
