ouyang et al . proposed an $ ( n , n)$ threshold quantum secret sharing scheme , where the number of participants is limited to $ n=4k+1,k\in z^+$ , and the security evaluation of the scheme was carried out accordingly . in this paper , we propose an $ ( n , n)$ threshold quantum secret sharing scheme for the number of participants $ n$ in any case ( $ n\in z^+$ ) . the scheme is based on a quantum circuit , which consists of clifford group gates and toffoli gate . we study the properties of the quantum circuit in this paper and use the quantum circuit to analyze the security of the scheme for dishonest participants .
