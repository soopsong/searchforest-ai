errors in the control of quantum systems may be classified as unitary , decoherent and incoherent . unitary errors are systematic , and result in a density matrix that differs from the desired one by a unitary operation . decoherent errors correspond to general completely positive superoperators , and can only be corrected using methods such as quantum error correction . incoherent errors can also be described , on average , by completely positive superoperators , but can nevertheless be corrected by the application of a locally unitary operation that ` ` refocuses ' ' them . they are due to reproducible spatial or temporal variations in the system 's hamiltonian , so that information on the variations is encoded in the system 's spatiotemporal state and can be used to correct them . in this paper liquid - state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) is used to demonstrate that such refocusing effects can be built directly into the control fields , where the incoherence arises from spatial inhomogeneities in the quantizing static magnetic field as well as the radio - frequency control fields themselves . using perturbation theory , it is further shown that the eigenvalue spectrum of the completely positive superoperator exhibits a characteristic spread that contains information on the hamiltonians ' underlying distribution .
