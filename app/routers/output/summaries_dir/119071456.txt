spin and orbital angular momenta ( am ) of light are well studied for free - space electromagnetic fields , even nonparaxial . one of the important applications of these concepts is the information transfer using am modes , often via optical fibers and other guiding systems . however , the self - consistent description of the spin and orbital am of light in optical media ( including dispersive and metallic cases ) was provided only recently [ k.y . bliokh et al . , phys . rev . lett . 119 , 073901 ( 2017 ) ] . here we present the first accurate calculations , both analytical and numerical , of the spin and orbital am , as well as the helicity and other properties , for the full - vector eigenmodes of cylindrical dielectric and metallic ( nanowire ) waveguides . we find remarkable fundamental relations , such as the quantization of the canonical total am of cylindrical guided modes in the general nonparaxial case . this quantization , as well as the noninteger values of the spin and orbital am , are determined by the generalized geometric and dynamical phases in the mode fields . moreover , we show that the spin am of metallic - wire modes is determined , in the geometrical - optics approximation , by the transverse spin of surface plasmon - polaritons propagating along helical trajectories on the wire surface . our work provides a solid platform for future studies and applications of the am and helicity properties of guided optical and plasmonic waves .
