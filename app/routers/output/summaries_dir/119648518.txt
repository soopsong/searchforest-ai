we investigate the relationship between mixedness and entanglement for gaussian states of continuous variable systems . we introduce generalized entropies based on schatten $ p$-norms to quantify the mixedness of a state , and derive their explicit expressions in terms of symplectic spectra . we compare the hierarchies of mixedness provided by such measures with the one provided by the purity ( defined as $ { \rm tr } \varrho^2 $ for the state $ \varrho$ ) for generic $ n$-mode states . we then review the analysis proving the existence of both maximally and minimally entangled states at given global and marginal purities , with the entanglement quantified by the logarithmic negativity . based on these results , we extend such an analysis to generalized entropies , introducing and fully characterizing maximally and minimally entangled states for given global and local generalized entropies . we compare the different roles played by the purity and by the generalized $ p$-entropies in quantifying the entanglement and the mixedness of continuous variable systems . we introduce the concept of average logarithmic negativity , showing that it allows a reliable quantitative estimate of continuous variable entanglement by direct measurements of global and marginal generalized $ p$-entropies .
