in this paper we construct ( nonhomogeneous ) quantum markov chains associated with open quantum random walks . the quantum markov chain , like the classical markov chain , is a fundamental tool for the investigation of the basic properties such as reducibility / irreducibility , recurrence / transience , accessibility , ergodicity , etc , of the underlying dynamics . here we focus on the discussion of the reducibility and irreducibility of open quantum random walks via the corresponding quantum markov chains . particularly we show that the concept of reducibility / irreducibility of open quantum random walks in this approach is equivalent to the one previously done by carbone and pautrat . we provide with some examples . we will see also that the classical markov chains can be reconstructed as quantum markov chains .
