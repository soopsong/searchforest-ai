we study the zero - temperature phase diagram of a one - dimensional array of qed cavities where , besides the single - photon hopping , an additional coupling between neighboring cavities is mediated by an n - type four - level system . by varying the relative strength of the various couplings , the array is shown to exhibit a variety of quantum phases including a polaritonic mott insulator , a density - wave and a superfluid phase . our results have been obtained by means of numerical density - matrix renormalization group calculations . the phase diagram was obtained by analyzing the energy gaps for the polaritons , as well as through a study of two - point correlation functions .
