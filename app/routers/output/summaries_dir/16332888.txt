once in its non - equilibrium steady state , a nanoscale system coupled to several heat baths may be thought - of as a quantum heat pump . depending on the direction of its stationary heat flows it may function as e.g. a refrigerator or a heat transformer . these continuous heat devices can be arbitrarily complex multipartite systems , and yet their working principle is always the same : they are made up of several elementary three - level stages operating in parallel . as a result , it is possible to devise external black - box testing strategies to learn about their functionality and performance regardless of any internal details . in particular , one such heat pump can be tested by coupling a two - level spin to one of its contact transitions . the steady state of this external probe contains information about the presence of heat leaks and internal dissipation in the device , and also , about the direction of its steady - state heat currents . provided that the irreversibility of the heat pump is low , one can further estimate its coefficient of performance . these techniques may find applications in the emerging field of quantum thermal engineering , as they facilitate the diagnosis and design optimization of complex thermodynamic cycles .
