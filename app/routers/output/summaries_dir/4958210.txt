we report on the results from a search for dark matter axions with the haystac experiment using a microwave cavity detector at frequencies between 5.6 - 5.8$\ , \rm ghz$. we exclude axion models with two photon coupling $ g_{a\gamma\gamma}\,\gtrsim\,2\times10^{-14}\,\rm gev^{-1}$ , a factor of 2.7 above the benchmark ksvz model over the mass range 23.15$\,<\,$$m_a \,$<$\,$24.0$\,\mu\rm ev$. this doubles the range reported in our previous paper . we achieve a near - quantum - limited sensitivity by operating at a temperature $ t < h\nu/2k_b$ and incorporating a josephson parametric amplifier ( jpa ) , with improvements in the cooling of the cavity further reducing the experiment 's system noise temperature to only twice the standard quantum limit at its operational frequency , an order of magnitude better than any other dark matter microwave cavity experiment to date . this result concludes the first phase of the haystac program utilizing a conventional copper cavity and a single jpa .
