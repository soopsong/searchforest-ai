considering some important classes of generalized coherent states known in literature , we demonstrated that all of them can be created via conventional fashion , i.e. the"lowering operator eigen - state"and the"displacement operator"techniques using the { \it"nonlinear coherent states " } approach . as a result we obtained a { \it"unified method " } to construct a large class of coherent states which already have been introduced by different prescriptions .
