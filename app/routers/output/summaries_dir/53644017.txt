determination of qubit initialisation and measurement fidelity is important for the overall performance of a quantum computer . however , the method by which it is calculated in semiconductor qubits varies between experiments . in this paper we present a full theoretical analysis of electronic single - shot readout and describe critical parameters to achieve high fidelity readout . in particular , we derive a model for energy selective state readout based on a charge detector response and examine how to optimise the fidelity by choosing correct experimental parameters . although we focus on single electron spin readout , the theory presented can be applied to other electronic readout techniques in semiconductors that use a reservoir .
