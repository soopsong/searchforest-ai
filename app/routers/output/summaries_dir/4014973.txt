by controlling the state of neuronal populations , neuromodulators ultimately affect behaviour . a key neuromodulation mechanism is the alteration of neuronal excitability via the modulation of ion channel expression . this type of neuromodulation is normally studied via conductance - based models , but those models are computationally challenging for large - scale network simulations needed in population studies . this paper studies the modulation properties of the multi - quadratic integrate - and - fire ( mqif ) model , a generalisation of the classical quadratic integrate - and - fire ( qif ) model . the model is shown to combine the computational economy of integrate - and - fire modelling and the physiological interpretability of conductance - based modelling . it is therefore a good candidate for affordable computational studies of neuromodulation in large networks .
