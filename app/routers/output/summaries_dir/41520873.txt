we experimentally and theoretically analyze the propagation of weak signal field pulses under the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in hot rb vapor , and study the effects of resonant four - wave mixing ( fwm ) . in particular , we demonstrate that in a double-$\lambda$ system , formed by the strong control field with the weak resonant signal and a far - detuned stokes field , both continuous - wave spectra and pulse propagation dynamics for the signal field depend strongly on the amplitude of the seeded stokes field , and the effect is enhanced in optically dense atomic medium . we also show that the theory describing the coupled propagation of the signal and stokes fields is in good agreement with the experimental observations .
