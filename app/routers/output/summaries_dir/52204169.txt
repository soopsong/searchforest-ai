it is shown that superconducting charge and phase qubits are quantum versions of memory capacitive and inductive systems , respectively . we demonstrate that such quantum memcapacitive and meminductive devices offer remarkable and rich response functionalities . in particular , when subjected to periodic input , qubit - based memcapacitors and meminductors exhibit unusual hysteresis curves . our work not only extends the set of known memcapacitive and meminductive systems to qubit - based quantum devices but also highlights their unique properties potentially useful for future technological applications .
