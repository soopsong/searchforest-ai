a model is discussed where all operators are constructed from a quantum scalar field whose energy spectrum takes on all real values . the schr\"odinger picture wave function depends upon space and time coordinates for each particle , as well as an inexorably increasing evolution parameter $ s$ which labels a foliation of space - like hypersurfaces . the model is constructed to be manifestly lorentz invariant in the interaction picture . free particle states and interactions are discussed in this framework . then , the formalism of the csl ( continuous spontaneous localization ) theory of dynamical collapse is applied . the collapse - generating operator is chosen to to be the particle number space - time density . unlike previous relativistically invariant models , the vacuum state is not excited . the collapse dynamics depends upon two parameters , a parameter $ \lambda$ which represents the collapse rate / volume and a scale factor $ \ell$. a common example of collapse dynamics , involving a clump of matter in a superposition of two locations , is analyzed . the collapse rate is shown to be identical to that of non - relativistic csl when the grw - csl choice of $ \ell = a=10^{-5}$cm , is made , along with $ \lambda=\lambda / a^{3}$ ( grw - csl choice $ \lambda=10^{-16}s^{-1}$ ) . however , it is also shown that the change of mass of a nucleon over the age of the universe is then unacceptably large . the case where $ \ell$ is the size of the universe is then considered . it is shown that the collapse behavior is satisfactory and the change of mass over the age of the universe is acceptably small , when $ \lambda= \lambda/\ell a^{2}$.
