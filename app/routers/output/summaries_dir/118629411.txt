shortcomings of experimental techniques are usually assumed to diminish nonclassical properties of quantum systems . here it is demonstrated that this standard assumption is not true in general . it is theoretically shown that the inability to resolve different photon numbers in photodetection may pseudo - increase a measured bell parameter . under proper conditions one even pseudo - violates the quantum cirel'son bound of the bell parameter , the corresponding density operator fails to be positive semi - definite . this paradox can be resolved by appropriate squash models .
