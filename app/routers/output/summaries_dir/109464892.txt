superconducting systems have a long history of use in experiments that push the frontiers of mechanical sensing . this includes both applied and fundamental research , which at present day ranges from quantum computing research and efforts to explore planck - scale physics to fundamental studies on the nature of motion and the quantum limits on our ability to measure it . in this paper , we first provide a short history of the role of superconducting circuitry and devices in mechanical sensing , focusing primarily on efforts in the last decade to push the study of quantum mechanics to include motion on the scale of human - made structures . this background sets the stage for the remainder of the paper , which focuses on the development of quantum electromechanical systems ( qems ) that incorporate superconducting quantum bits ( qubits ) , superconducting transmission line resonators and flexural nanomechanical elements . in addition to providing the motivation and relevant background on the physical behavior of these systems , we discuss our recent efforts to develop a particular type of qems that is based upon the cooper - pair box ( cpb ) and superconducting coplanar waveguide ( cpw ) cavities , a system which has the potential to serve as a testbed for studying the quantum properties of motion in engineered systems .
