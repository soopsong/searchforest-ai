we present a quantum solution to the electron spin decoherence by a nuclear pair - correlation method for the electron - nuclear spin dynamics under a strong magnetic field and a temperature high for the nuclear spins but low for the electron . the theory incorporates the hyperfine interaction , the intrinsic ( both direct and indirect ) nuclear interactions , and the extrinsic nuclear coupling mediated by the hyperfine interaction with the single electron in question . the last is shown to be important in free - induction decay ( fid ) of the single electron spin coherence . the spin echo eliminates the hyperfine - mediated decoherence but only reduces the decoherence by the intrinsic nuclear interactions . thus , the decoherence times for single spin fid and ensemble spin echo are significantly different . the decoherence is explained in terms of quantum entanglement , which involves more than the spectral diffusion .
