typical treatments of superconducting or superfluid josephson junctions rely on mean - field or two - mode models ; we explore many - body dynamics of an isolated , ultracold , bose - gas long josephson junction using time - evolving block decimation simulations . we demonstrate that with increasing repulsive interaction strength , localized dynamics emerge that influence macroscopic condensate behavior and can lead to formation of solitons that directly oppose the symmetry of the junction . initial state population and phase yield insight into dynamic tunneling regimes of a quasi one - dimensional double well potential , from josephson oscillations to macroscopic self - trapping . population imbalance simulations reveal substantial deviation of many - body dynamics from mean - field gross - pitaevskii predictions , particularly as the barrier height and interaction strength increase . in addition , the sudden approximation supports localized particle - hole formation after a diabatic quench , and correlation measures unveil a new dynamic regime : the fock flashlight .
