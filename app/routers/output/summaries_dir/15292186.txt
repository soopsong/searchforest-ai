both in classical and quantum stochastic control theory a major role is played by the filtering equation , which recursively updates the information state of the system under observation . unfortunately , the theory is plagued by infinite - dimensionality of the information state which severely limits its practical applicability , except in a few select cases ( e.g. the linear gaussian case . ) one solution proposed in classical filtering theory is that of the projection filter . in this scheme , the filter is constrained to evolve in a finite - dimensional family of densities through orthogonal projection on the tangent space with respect to the fisher metric . here we apply this approach to the simple but highly nonlinear quantum model of optical phase bistability of a stongly coupled two - level atom in an optical cavity . we observe near - optimal performance of the quantum projection filter , demonstrating the utility of such an approach .
