we examine the feasibility of creating and measuring large relative number squeezing in multicomponent trapped bose - einstein condensates . in the absence of multimode effects , this squeezing can be arbitrarily large for arbitrarily large condensates , but a range of processes limit the measurable squeezing in realistic trap configurations . we examine these processes , and suggest methods to mitigate them . we conclude that high levels of squeezing with large numbers of atoms is feasible , but can realistically only be achieved in particular trap geometries . we also introduce a method of maximising the measurable squeezing by using a $ \pi$-pulse during the process to improve spatial mode - matching .
