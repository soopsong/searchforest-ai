quantum walks have attracted attention as a promising platform realizing topological phenomena and many physicists have introduced various types of indices to characterize topologically protected bound states that are robust against perturbations . in this paper , we introduce an index from a supersymmetric point of view . this allows us to define indices for all chiral symmetric quantum walks such as multi - dimensional split - step quantum walks and quantum walks on graphs , for which there has been no index theory . moreover , the index gives a lower bound on the number of bound states robust against compact perturbations . we also calculate the index for several concrete examples including the unitary transformation that appears in grover 's search algorithm .
