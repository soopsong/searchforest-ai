a dynamical quantum phase transition can occur during time evolution of sudden quenched quantum systems across a phase transition . it corresponds to the nonanalytic behavior at a critical time of the rate function of the quantum state return amplitude , analogous to nonanalyticity of the free energy density at the critical temperature in macroscopic systems . a variety of many - body systems can be represented in momentum space as a spin-1/2 state evolving on the bloch sphere , where each momentum mode is decoupled and thus can be simulated independently by a single qubit . here , we report the observation of a dynamical quantum phase transition in a superconducting qubit simulation of the quantum quench dynamics of many - body systems . we take the ising model with a transverse field as an example for demonstration . in our experiment , the spin state , which is initially polarized longitudinally , evolves based on a hamiltonian with adjustable parameters depending on the momentum and strength of the transverse magnetic field . the time evolving quantum state is read out by state tomography . evidence of dynamical quantum phase transitions , such as paths of time evolution states on the bloch sphere , non - analytic behavior of the dynamical free energy and the emergence of skyrmion lattice in momentum - time space , is observed . the experimental data agrees well with theoretical and numerical calculations . the experiment demonstrates for the first time explicitly the topological invariant , both topologically trivial and non - trivial , for dynamical quantum phase transitions . our results show that the quantum phase transitions of this class of many - body systems can be simulated successfully with a single qubit by varying certain control parameters over the corresponding momentum range .
