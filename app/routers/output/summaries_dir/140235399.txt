we study the existence of bound states in the continuum for a system of n two - level quantum emitters , coupled with a one - dimensional boson field , in which a single excitation is shared among different components of the system . the emitters are fixed and equally spaced . we first consider the approximation of distant emitters , in which one can find degenerate eigenspaces of bound states corresponding to resonant values of energy , parametrized by a positive integer . we then consider the full form of the eigenvalue equation , in which the effects of the finite spacing and the field dispersion relation become relevant , yielding also nonperturbative effects . we explicitly solve the cases n=3 and n=4 .
