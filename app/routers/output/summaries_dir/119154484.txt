we consider the limit distributions of open quantum random walks on one - dimensional lattice space . we introduce a dual process to the original quantum walk process , which is quite similar to the relation of schr\"odinger - heisenberg representation in quantum mechanics . by this , we can compute the distribution of the open quantum random walks concretely for many examples and thereby we can also obtain the limit distributions of them . in particular , it is possible to get rid of the initial state when we consider the evolution of the walk , it appears only in the last step of the computation .
