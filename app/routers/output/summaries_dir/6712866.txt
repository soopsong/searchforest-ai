coherent - state quantum process tomography ( csqpt ) is a method of completely characterizing a quantum - optical"black box"by probing it with coherent states and performing homodyne measurements on the output [ m. lobino et al , science 322 , 563 ( 2008 ) ] . we present a technique for csqpt that is fully based on statistical inference , specifically , quantum expectation - maximization . the method relies on the jamiolkowski isomorphism and iteratively reconstructs the process tensor in the fock basis directly from the experimental data . this approach permits incorporation of a priori constraints into the reconstruction procedure , thereby guaranteeing that the resulting process tensor is physically consistent . furthermore , our method is easier to implement and requires a narrower range of coherent states than its predecessors . we test its feasibility using simulations on several experimentally relevant processes .
