we discuss how adiabatic potentials can be used to create addressable lattices on a subwavelength scale , which can be used as a tool for local operations and readout within a lattice substructure , while taking advantage of the faster timescales and higher energy and temperature scales determined by the shorter lattice spacing . for alkaline - earth - like atoms with non - zero nuclear spin , these potentials can be made state dependent , for which we give specific examples with $ ^{171}$yb atoms . we discuss in detail the limitations in generating the lattice potentials , in particular non - adiabatic losses , and show that the loss rates can always be made exponentially small by increasing the laser power .
