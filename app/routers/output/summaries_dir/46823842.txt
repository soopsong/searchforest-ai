optomechanical systems based on nanophotonics are advancing the field of precision motion measurement , quantum control and nanomechanical sensing . in this context iii - v semiconductors offer original assets like the heteroepitaxial growth of optimized metamaterials for photon / phonon interactions . gaas has already demonstrated high performances in optomechanics but suffers from two photon absorption ( tpa ) at the telecom wavelength , which can limit the cooperativity . here , we investigate tpa - free iii - v semiconductor materials for optomechanics applications : gaas lattice - matched in0:5ga0:5p and al0:4ga0:6as . we report on the fabrication and optical characterization of high frequency ( 500 - 700 mhz ) optomechanical disks made out of these two materials , demonstrating high optical and mechanical q in ambient conditions . finally we achieve operating these new devices as laser - sustained optomechanical self - oscillators , and draw a first comparative study with existing gaas systems .
