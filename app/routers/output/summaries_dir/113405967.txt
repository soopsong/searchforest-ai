we show that the unruh effect can create net quantum entanglement between inertial and accelerated observers depending on the choice of the inertial state . this striking result banishes the extended belief that the unruh effect can only destroy entanglement and furthermore provides a new and unexpected source for finding experimental evidence of the unruh and hawking effects .
