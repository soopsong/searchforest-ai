this paper aims to determine the fault tolerant quantum filter and fault detection equation for a class of open quantum systems coupled to a laser field that is subject to stochastic faults . in order to analyze this class of open quantum systems , we propose a quantum - classical bayesian inference method based on the definition of a so - called quantum - classical conditional expectation . it is shown that the proposed bayesian inference approach provides a convenient tool to simultaneously derive the fault tolerant quantum filter and the fault detection equation for this class of open quantum systems . an example of two - level open quantum systems subject to poisson - type faults is presented to illustrate the proposed method . these results have the potential to lead to a new fault tolerant control theory for quantum systems .
