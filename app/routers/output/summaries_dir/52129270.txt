we develop a local probe to estimate the connectivity of complex quantum networks . our results show how global properties of different classes of complex networks can be estimated - in quantitative manner with high accuracy - by coupling a probe to a single node of the network . here , our interest is focused on probing the connectivity , i.e. the degree sequence , and the value of the coupling constant within the complex network . the scheme combines results on classical graph theory with the ability to develop quantum probes for networks of quantum harmonic oscillators . whilst our results are proof - of - principle type , within the emerging field of quantum complex networks they may have potential applications for example to the efficient transfer of quantum information or energy or possibly to shed light on the connection between network structure and dynamics .
