in this paper the idea of holonomic quantum computation is realized within quantum optics . in a non - linear kerr medium the degenerate states of laser beams are interpreted as qubits . displacing devices , squeezing devices and interferometers provide the classical control parameter space where the adiabatic loops are performed . this results into logical gates acting on the states of the combined degenerate subspaces of the lasers , producing any one qubit rotations and interactions between any two qubits . issues such as universality , complexity and scalability are addressed and several steps are taken towards the physical implementation of this model .
