we consider a novel approach to address the black hole information paradox ( bhip ) . the idea is based on adapting , to the situation at hand , the modified versions of quantum theory involving spontaneous stochastic dynamical collapse of quantum states , which have been considered in attempts to deal with shortcomings of the standard copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics , in particular , the issue known as"the measurement problem " . the new basic hypothesis is that the modified quantum behavior is enhanced in the region of high curvature so that the information encoded in the initial quantum state of the matter fields is rapidly erased as the black hole singularity is approached . we show that in this manner the complete evaporation of the black hole via hawking radiation can be understood as involving no paradox . calculations are performed using a modified version of quantum theory known as"continuous spontaneous localization"(csl ) , which was originally developed in the context of many particle non - relativistic quantum mechanics . we use a version of csl tailored to quantum field theory and applied in the context of the two dimensional callan - giddings - harvey - strominger ( cghs ) model . although the role of quantum gravity in this picture is restricted to the resolution of the singularity , related studies suggest that there might be further connections .
