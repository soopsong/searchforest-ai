optimized , necessary and sufficient conditions for the identification of the schmidt number will be derived in terms of general hermitian operators . these conditions apply to arbitrary mixed quantum states . the optimization procedure delivers equations similar to the eigenvalue problem of an operator . the properties of the solution of these equations will be studied . we solve these equations for classes of operators . the solutions will be applied to phase randomized two - mode squeezed - vacuum states in continuous variable systems .
