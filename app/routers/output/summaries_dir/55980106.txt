rather than point estimators , states of a quantum system that represent one 's best guess for the given data , we consider optimal regions of estimators . as the natural counterpart of the popular maximum - likelihood point estimator , we introduce the maximum - likelihood region --- the region of largest likelihood among all regions of the same size . here , the size of a region is its prior probability . another concept is the smallest credible region --- the smallest region with pre - chosen posterior probability . for both optimization problems , the optimal region has constant likelihood on its boundary . we discuss criteria for assigning prior probabilities to regions , and illustrate the concepts and methods with several examples .
