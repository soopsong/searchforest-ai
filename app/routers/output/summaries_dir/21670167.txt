we investigate the average bipartite entanglement , over all possible divisions of a multipartite system , as a useful measure of multipartite entanglement . we expose a connection between such measures and quantum - error - correcting codes by deriving a formula relating the weight distribution of the code to the average entanglement of encoded states . multipartite entangling power of quantum evolutions is also investigated .
