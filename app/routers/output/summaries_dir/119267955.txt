aperiodic dynamical decoupling ( dd ) sequences of $ \pi$ pulses are of great interest to decoherence control and have been recently extended from single - qubit to two - qubit systems . if the environmental noise power spectrum is made available , then one may further optimize aperiodic dd sequences to reach higher efficiency of decoherence suppression than known universal schemes . this possibility is investigated in this work for the protection of two - qubit states , using an exactly solvable pure dephasing model including both local and nonlocal noise . the performance of optimized dd sequences in protecting two - qubit states is compared with that achieved by nested uhrig 's dd ( nested - udd ) sequences , for several different types of noise spectrum . except for cases with noise spectrum decaying slowly in the high - frequency regime , optimized dd sequences with tens of control pulses can perform orders of magnitude better than that of nested - udd . a two - qubit system with highly unbalanced local noise is also examined to shed more light on a recent experiment . possible experiments that may be motivated by this work are discussed .
