a quantum communication network can be constructed by distributing a multipartite entangled state to space - separated nodes . entangled optical beams with highest flying speed and measurable brightness can be used as carriers to convey information in quantum communication networks . losses and noises existing in real communication channels will reduce or even totally destroy entanglement . the phenomenon of disentanglement will result in the complete failure of quantum communication . here , we present the experimental demonstrations on the disentanglement and the entanglement revival of tripartite entangled optical beams used in a quantum network . we discover that symmetric tripartite entangled optical beams are robust in pure lossy but noiseless channels . while in a noisy channel the excess noise will lead to the disentanglement and the destroyed entanglement can be revived by the use of a correlated noisy channel ( non - markovian environment ) . the presented results provide useful technical references for establishing quantum networks .
