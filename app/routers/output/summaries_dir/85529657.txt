we introduce a new model of spin noncommutative space in which noncommutative extension of the coordinate operators are assumed to be chirality dependent . noncommutative correspondences of classical fields are defined via weyl ordering , and the maps are represented by a spin - dependent translation operator . based on the maps , gauge field theory in chiral spin noncommutative space is established . the corresponding gauge transformations are induced by a local phase rotation on commutative functions , and hence are consistent with the ordinary gauge transformations by definition . furthermore , a general extension of the ordering between dirac matrix and gauge potential is introduced . noncommutative corrections on equations of motion of matter and gauge fields are studied . we find that there are two kinds of corrections . the first kind of correction involves derivatives of the matter field , and hence contribute the ordinary noether current . on the other hand , the second kind of correction depends only on derivatives of the gauge fields , and hence contribute anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of the matter field . moreover , experimental bounds on the noncommutative parameters for muon lepton are studied in a simplified model .
