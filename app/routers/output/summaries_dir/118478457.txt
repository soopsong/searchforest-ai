in this paper we study the subset of generalized quantum measurements on finite dimensional systems known as local operations and classical communication ( locc ) . while locc emerges as the natural class of operations in many important quantum information tasks , its mathematical structure is complex and difficult to characterize . here we provide a precise description of locc and related operational classes in terms of quantum instruments . our formalism captures both finite round protocols as well as those that utilize an unbounded number of communication rounds . while the set of locc is not topologically closed , we show that finite round locc constitutes a compact subset of quantum operations . additionally we show the existence of an open ball around the completely depolarizing map that consists entirely of locc implementable maps . finally , we demonstrate a two - qubit map whose action can be approached arbitrarily close using locc , but nevertheless can not be implemented perfectly .
