bosonsampling is a problem where a quantum computer offers a provable speedup over classical computers . its main feature is that it can be solved with current linear optics technology , without the need for a full quantum computer . in this work , we investigate whether an experimentally realistic bosonsampler can really solve bosonsampling without any fault - tolerance mechanism . more precisely , we study how the unavoidable errors linked to an imperfect calibration of the optical elements affect the final result of the computation . we show that the fidelity of each optical element must be at least $ 1 - o(1 / n^2)$ , where $ n$ refers to the number of single photons in the scheme . such a requirement seems to be achievable with state - of - the - art equipment .
