we propose a single - photon router using a single atom with an inversion center coupled to quantum multichannels made of coupled - resonator waveguides . we show that the spontaneous emission of the atom can direct single photons from one quantum channel into another . the on - demand classical field perfectly switches - off the single - photon routing due to the quantum interference in the atomic amplitudes of optical transitions . total reflections in the incident channel are due to the photonic bound state in the continuum . two virtual channels , named as scatter - free and controllable channels , are found , which are coherent superpositions of quantum channels . any incident photon in the scatter - free channel is totally transmitted . the propagating states of the controllable channel are orthogonal to those of the scatter - free channel . single photons in the controllable channel can be perfectly reflected or transmitted by the atom .
