we analyze strong noise limit of some stochastic differential equations . we focus on the particular case of belavkin equations , arising from quantum measurements , where bauer and bernard pointed out an intriguing behavior . as the noise grows larger , the solutions exhibits locally a collapsing , that is to say converge to jump processes , very reminiscent of a metastability phenomenon . but surprisingly the limiting jump process is decorated by a spike process . we completely prove these statements for an archetypal one dimensional diffusion . the proof is robust and can easily be adapted to a large class of one dimensional diffusions .
