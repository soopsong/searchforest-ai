photonic time - frequency entanglement is a promising resource for quantum information processing technologies . we investigate swapping of continuous - variable entanglement in the time - frequency degree of freedom using three - wave mixing in the low - gain regime with the aim of producing heralded biphoton states with high purity and low multi - pair probability . heralding is achieved by combining one photon from each of two biphoton sources via sum - frequency generation to create a herald photon . we present a realistic model with pulsed pumps , investigate the effects of resolving the frequency of the herald photon , and find that frequency - resolving measurement of the herald photon is necessary to produce high - purity biphotons . we also find a trade - off between the rate of successful entanglement swapping and both the purity and quantified entanglement resource ( negativity ) of the heralded biphoton state .
