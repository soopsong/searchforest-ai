we study the disorder - perturbed transport of two entangled particles in the absence of backscattering . this situation is , for instance , realized along edges of topological insulators . we find profoundly different responses to disorder - induced dephasing for the center - of - mass and relative coordinates : while a mirror symmetry protects even highly delocalized relative states when resonant with the symmetry condition , delocalizations in the center of mass ( e.g. two - particle n00n states ) remain fully sensitive to disorder . we demonstrate the relevance of these differences to the example of interferometric entanglement detection . our platform - independent analysis is based on the treatment of disorder - averaged quantum systems with quantum master equations .
