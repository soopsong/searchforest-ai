we show optical waves passing through a nanophotonic medium can perform artificial neural computing . complex information , is encoded in the wave front of an input light . the medium transforms the wave front to realize sophisticated computing tasks such as image recognition . at the output , the optical energy is concentrated to well - defined locations , which for example can be interpreted as the identity of the object in the image . these computing media can be as small as tens of wavelengths and offer ultra - high computing density . they exploit sub - wavelength scatterers to realize complex input output mapping beyond the capabilities of traditional nanophotonic devices .
