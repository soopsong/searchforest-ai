an important and well established area of quantum optics is the theory of markovian stochastic schr\"odinger equations ( or by another name quantum trajectory theory ) . recently stochastic schr\"odinger equations have been developed for non - markovian systems . in this paper we extend the current known stochastic schr\"odinger equations for non - markovian systems to include the position unraveling . we also discuss and illustrate that this stochastic schr\"odinger equation can have an interpretation under both the orthodox and the de broglie - bohm hidden variable interpretation of quantum mechanics . we conclude that only the de broglie - bohm hidden variable theory provides a continuous - in - time interpretation of the non - markovian stochastic schr\"odinger equation .
