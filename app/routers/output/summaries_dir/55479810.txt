quantum circuits with hierarchical structure have been used to perform binary classification of classical data encoded in a quantum state . we demonstrate that more expressive circuits in the same family achieve better accuracy and can be used to classify highly entangled quantum states , for which there is no known efficient classical method . we compare performance for several different parameterizations on two classical machine learning datasets , iris and mnist , and on a synthetic dataset of quantum states . finally , we demonstrate that performance is robust to noise and deploy an iris dataset classifier on the ibmqx4 quantum computer .
