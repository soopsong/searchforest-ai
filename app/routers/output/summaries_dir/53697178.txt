staggered quantum walks on graphs are based on the concept of graph tessellation and generalize some well - known discrete - time quantum walk models . in this work , we address the class of 2-tessellable quantum walks with the goal of obtaining an eigenbasis of the evolution operator . by interpreting the evolution operator as a quantum markov chain on an underlying multigraph , we define the concept of quantum detailed balance , which helps to obtain the eigenbasis . a subset of the eigenvectors is obtained from the eigenvectors of the double discriminant matrix of the quantum markov chain . to obtain the remaining eigenvectors , we have to use the quantum detailed balance conditions . if the quantum markov chain has a quantum detailed balance , there is an eigenvector for each fundamental cycle of the underlying multigraph . if the quantum markov chain does not have a quantum detailed balance , we have to use two fundamental cycles linked by a path in order to find the remaining eigenvectors . we exemplify the process of obtaining the eigenbasis of the evolution operator using the kagome lattice ( the line graph of the hexagonal lattice ) , which has symmetry properties that help in the calculation process .
