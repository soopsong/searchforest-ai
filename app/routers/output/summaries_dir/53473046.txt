we holographically compute an inter - boundary entanglement entropy in a time - dependent two - sided black hole which was constructed in hep - th/0701108 by applying time - dependent janus deformation to btz black hole . the black hole contains"causal shadow region"which is causally disconnected from both the conformal boundaries . we find that the janus deformation results in an earlier phase transition between the extremal surfaces and that the phase transition disappears when the causal shadow is sufficiently large .
