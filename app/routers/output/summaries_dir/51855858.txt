the evolution of a many - particle system on a one - dimensional lattice , subjected to a quantum walk can cause spatial entanglement in the lattice position , which can be exploited for quantum information / communication purposes . we demonstrate the evolution of spatial entanglement and its dependence on the quantum coin operation parameters , the number of particles present in the lattice and the number of steps of quantum walk on the system . thus , spatial entanglement can be controlled and optimized using a many - particle discrete - time quantum walk .
