we investigate quantum teleportation of ensembles of coherent states of light with a gaussian distributed displacement in phase space . recently , the following general question has been addressed in [ p. liuzzo - scorpo et al . , arxiv:1705.03017 ] : given a limited amount of entanglement and mean energy available as resources , what is the maximal fidelity that can be achieved on average in the teleportation of such an alphabet of states ? here , we consider a variation of this question , where einstein - podolsky - rosen steering is used as a resource rather than plain entanglement . we provide a solution by means of an optimisation within the space of gaussian quantum channels , which allows for an intuitive visualisation of the problem . we first show that not all channels are accessible with a finite degree of steering , and then prove that practical schemes relying on asymmetric two - mode gaussian states enable one to reach the maximal fidelity at the border with the inaccessible region . our results provide a rigorous quantitative assessment of steering as a resource for secure quantum teleportation beyond the so - called no - cloning threshold . the schemes we propose can be readily implemented experimentally by a conventional braunstein - kimble continuous variable teleportation protocol involving homodyne detections and corrective displacements with an optimally tuned gain . these protocols can be integrated as elementary building blocks in quantum networks , for reliable storage and transmission of quantum optical states .
