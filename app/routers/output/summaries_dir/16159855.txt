we study a coupling / decoupling method between a superconducting qubit and a data bus that uses a controllable time - dependent electromagnetic field ( tdef ) . as in recent experiments , the data bus can be either an lc circuit or a cavity field . when the qubit and the data bus are initially fabricated , their detuning should be made far larger than their coupling constant , so these can be treated as two independent subsystems . however , if a tdef is applied to the qubit , then a"dressed qubit"(i.e . , qubit plus the electromagnetic field ) can be formed . by choosing appropriate parameters for the tdef , the dressed qubit can be coupled to the data bus and , thus , the qubit and the data bus can exchange information with the assistance of the tdef . this mechanism allows the scalability of the circuit to many qubits . with the help of the tdef , any two qubits can be selectively coupled to ( and decoupled from ) a common data bus . therefore , quantum information can be transferred from one qubit to another .
