standard entropy calculations in quantum field theory , when applied to a subsystem of definite volume , exhibit area - dependent uv divergences that make a thermodynamic interpretation troublesome . in this paper we define a renormalized entropy which is related with the newton - wigner position operator . accordingly , whenever we trace over a region of space , we trace away degrees of freedom that are localized according to newton - wigner localization but not in the usual sense . we consider a free scalar field in d+1 spacetime dimensions prepared in a thermal state and we show that our entropy is free of divergences and has a perfectly sound thermodynamic behavior . in the high temperature / big volume limit our results agree with the standard qft calculations once the divergent contributions are subtracted from the latter . in the limit of low temperature / small volume the entropy goes to zero but with a different dependence on the temperature .
