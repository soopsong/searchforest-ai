the possibility that a classical space - time and quantum matter cohabit at the deepest level , i.e. the possibility of having a fundamental and not phenomenological semiclassical gravity , is often disregarded for lack of a good candidate theory . the standard semiclassical theory suffers from fundamental inconsistencies ( e.g. : schr\"odinger cat sources , faster - than - light communication and violation of the born rule ) which can only be ignored in simple typical situations . we harness the power of spontaneous localization models , historically constructed to solve the measurement problem in quantum mechanics , to build a consistent theory of ( stochastic ) semiclassical gravity in the newtonian limit . our model makes quantitative and potentially testable predictions : we recover the newtonian pair potential up to a short distance cut - off ( hence we predict no 1 particle self - interaction ) and uncover an additional gravitational decoherence term which depends on the specifics of the underlying spontaneous localization model considered . we hint at a possible program to go past the newtonian limit , towards a consistent general relativistic semiclassical gravity .
