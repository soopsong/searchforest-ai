we study the relation between the emergence of objectivity and qubit - environment entanglement generation . we find that although entanglement with the unobserved environments is irrelevant ( since sufficiently strong decoherence can occur regardless ) , entanglement with the observed environments is crucial . in fact , the appearance of an objective qubit - observed - environment state is strictly impossible if their joint evolution does not lead to entanglement . furthermore , if a single observer has access to a single environment ( no macrofractions ) then the required orthogonality of the observed environmental states comes only as a consequence of the system - enviornment state becoming strongly entangled ( maximally entangled for the given initial occupation of the qubit if the environmental state is initially pure ) .
