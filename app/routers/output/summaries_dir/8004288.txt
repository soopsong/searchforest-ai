a scalable , multiplexed ion trap for quantum information processing is fabricated and tested . the trap design and fabrication process are optimized for scalability to small trap size and large numbers of interconnected traps , and for integration of control electronics and optics . multiple traps with similar designs are tested with cd+ , mg+ , and sr+ ions at room temperature and with sr+ at 6 k , with respective ion lifetimes of 90 s , 300 + /- 30 s , 56 + /- 6 s , and 4.5 + /- 1.1 hours . the motional heating rate for mg+ at room temperature and a trap frequency of 1.6 mhz is measured to be 7 + /- 3 quanta per millisecond . for sr+ at 6 k and 540 khz the heating rate is measured to be 220 + /- 30 quanta per second .
