we investigate the performance of several continuous - variable quantum key distribution protocols in the presence of fading channels . these are lossy channels whose transmissivity changes according to a probability distribution . this is typical in communication scenarios where remote parties are connected by free - space links subject to atmospheric turbulence . in this work , we assume the worst - case scenario where an eavesdropper has full control of a fast fading process , so that she chooses the instantaneous transmissivity of a channel , while the remote parties can only detect the mean statistical process . in our study , we consider coherent - state protocols run in various configurations , including the one - way switching protocol in reverse reconciliation , the measurement - device - independent protocol in the symmetric configuration and a three - party measurement - device - independent network . we show that , regardless of the advantage given to the eavesdropper ( full control of fading ) , these protocols can still achieve high rates .
