quantum annealing is an optimization technique which potentially leverages quantum tunneling to enhance computational performance . existing quantum annealers use superconducting flux qubits with short coherence times , limited primarily by the use of large persistent currents $ i_\mathrm{p}$. here , we examine an alternative approach , using qubits with smaller $ i_\mathrm{p}$ and longer coherence times . we demonstrate tunable coupling , a basic building block for quantum annealing , between two flux qubits with small ( $ \sim 50~\mathrm{na}$ ) persistent currents . furthermore , we characterize qubit coherence as a function of coupler setting and investigate the effect of flux noise in the coupler loop on qubit coherence . our results provide insight into the available design space for next - generation quantum annealers with improved coherence .
