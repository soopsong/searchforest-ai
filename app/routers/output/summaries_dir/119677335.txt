this article presents explicit exponential integrators for stochastic maxwell 's equations driven by both multiplicative and additive noises . by utilizing the regularity estimate of the mild solution , we first prove that the strong order of the numerical approximation is $ \frac 12 $ for general multiplicative noise . combing a proper decomposition with the stochastic fubini 's theorem , the strong order of the proposed scheme is shown to be $ 1 $ for additive noise . moreover , for linear stochastic maxwell 's equation with additive noise , the proposed time integrator is shown to preserve exactly the symplectic structure , the evolution of the energy as well as the evolution of the divergence in the sense of expectation . several numerical experiments are presented in order to verify our theoretical findings .
