artificial atoms coupled to surface acoustic waves ( saws ) have played a crucial role in the recent development of circuit quantum acoustodynamics ( cqad ) . in this paper , we have investigated the interaction of an artificial atom and saws beyond the weak coupling regime , focusing on the role of the interdigital transducer ( idt ) that enables the coupling . we find a parameter regime in which the idt acts as a cavity for the atom , rather than an antenna . in other words , the atom forms its own cavity . similar to an atom coupled to an explicit cavity , this regime is characterized by vacuum - rabi splitting , as the atom hybridizes with the phononic vacuum inside the idt . this hybridization is possible because of the interdigitated coupling , which has a large spatial extension , and the slow propagation speed of saws . we work out a criterion for entering this regime from a model based on standard circuit - quantization techniques , taking only material parameters as inputs . most notably , we find this regime hard to avoid for an atom on top of a strong piezoelectric material , such as linbo$_3$. the saw - coupled atom on top of linbo$_3 $ can thus be regarded as an atom - cavity - bath system . on weaker piezoelectric materials , the number of idt electrodes need to be large in order to reach this regime .
