we investigate multipartite entanglement for composite quantum systems in a pure state . using the generalized bloch representation for n - qubit states , we express the condition that all k - qubit reductions of the whole system are maximally mixed , reflecting maximum bipartite entanglement across all k vs. n - k bipartitions . as a special case , we examine the class of balanced pure states , which are constructed from a subset of the pauli group p_n that is isomorphic to z_2^n . this makes a connection with the theory of quantum error - correcting codes and provides bounds on the largest allowed k for fixed n. in particular , the ratio k / n can be lower and upper bounded in the asymptotic regime , implying that there must exist multipartite entangled states with at least k=0.189 n when $ n\to \infty$. we also analyze symmetric states as another natural class of states with high multipartite entanglement and prove that , surprisingly , they can not have all maximally mixed k - qubit reductions with k>1 . thus , measured through bipartite entanglement across all bipartitions , symmetric states can not exhibit large entanglement . however , we show that the permutation symmetry only constrains some components of the generalized bloch vector , so that very specific patterns in this vector may be allowed even though k>1 is forbidden . this is illustrated numerically for a few symmetric states that maximize geometric entanglement , revealing some interesting structures .
