we consider first and second order consensus algorithms in networks with stochastic disturbances . we quantify the deviation from consensus using the notion of network coherence , which can be expressed as an $ h_2 $ norm of the stochastic system . we use the setting of fractal networks to investigate the question of whether a purely topological measure , such as the fractal dimension , can capture the asymptotics of coherence in the large system size limit . our analysis for first - order systems is facilitated by connections between first - order stochastic consensus and the global mean first passage time of random walks . we then show how to apply similar techniques to analyze second - order stochastic consensus systems . our analysis reveals that two networks with the same fractal dimension can exhibit different asymptotic scalings for network coherence . thus , this topological characterization of the network does not uniquely determine coherence behavior . the question of whether the performance of stochastic consensus algorithms in large networks can be captured by purely topological measures , such as the spatial dimension , remains open .
