we show that memristive networks - namely networks of resistors with memory - can efficiently solve shortest - path optimization problems . indeed , the presence of memory ( time non - locality ) promotes self organization of the network into the shortest possible path(s ) . we introduce a network entropy function to characterize the self - organized evolution , show the solution of the shortest - path problem and demonstrate the healing property of the solution path . finally , we provide an algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem . similar considerations apply to networks of memcapacitors and meminductors , and networks with memory in various dimensions .
