it is known that several sub - universal quantum computing models can not be classically simulated in polynomial - time unless the polynomial - time hierarchy collapses . these results , however , do not rule out possibilities of exponential- or sub - exponential - time classical simulations . in this paper , we study fine - grained quantum computational supremacy that excludes superpolynomial - time classical simulations . we first consider the dqc1 model . we show that for any $ a>0 $ output probability distributions of the $ n$-qubit dqc1 model can not be classically sampled within a constant multiplicative error and in $ 2^{(1-a)n+o(n)}$ time ( under certain conjectures in fine - grained complexity theory ) . we next show similar fine - grained quantum supremacy results for the hc1q model , which is another sub - universal model with a classical circuit sandwiched by two hadamard layers . finally , we also consider universal quantum computing with clifford and $ t$ gates . we first show that under the exponential - time hypothesis ( eth ) , output probability distributions of clifford-$t$ quantum computing can not be calculated in $ 2^{o(t)}$ time within an additive error smaller than $ 2^{-\frac{3t+14}{7}}$ , where $ t$ is the number of $ t$ gates . we next show that under another fine - grained complexity conjecture , output probability distributions of clifford-$t$ quantum computing can not be classically sampled in $ 2^{o(t)}$ time within a constant multiplicative error . there is a classical algorithm that calculates output probability distributions of clifford-$t$ quantum computing within a constant multiplicative error in $ \sim2^{\beta t}$ time with a non - trivial factor $ \beta\simeq0.47 $ [ s. bravyi and d. gosset , physical review letters 116 , 250501 ( 2016 ) ] . our second result on clifford-$t$ quantum computing therefore suggests that improving $ 2^{\beta t}$ to sub - exponential time , say $ 2^{\sqrt{t}}$ , is impossible .
