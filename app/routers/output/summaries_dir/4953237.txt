the original kerker effect was introduced for a hypothetical magnetic sphere , and initially it did not attract much attention due to a lack of magnetic materials required . rejuvenated by the recent explosive development of the field of metamaterials and especially its core concept of optically - induced artificial magnetism , the kerker effect has gained an unprecedented impetus and rapidly pervaded different branches of nanophotonics . at the same time , the concept behind the effect itself has also been significantly expanded and generalized . here we review the physics and various manifestations of the generalized kerker effects , including the progress in the emerging field of meta - optics that focuses on interferences of electromagnetic multipoles of different orders and origins . we discuss not only the scattering by individual particles and particle clusters , but also the manipulation of reflection , transmission , diffraction , and absorption for metalattices and metasurfaces , revealing how various optical phenomena observed recently are all ubiquitously related to the kerker 's concept .
