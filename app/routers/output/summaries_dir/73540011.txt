in this paper we provide a microscopic derivation of the master equation for the jaynes - cummings model with cavity losses . we single out both the differences with the phenomenological master equation used in the literature and the approximations under which the phenomenological model correctly describes the dynamics of the atom - cavity system . some examples wherein the phenomenological and the microscopic master equations give rise to different predictions are discussed in detail .
