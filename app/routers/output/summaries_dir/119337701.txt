the most natural way to describe an information - carrying system containing a specific noise is an additive white gaussian - noise ( awgn ) channel . in bosonic quantum systems ( especially the gaussian case ) , although the classical information capacity for a phase - insensitive and thermal - noise channel is additive based on a proof of the minimum output entropy conjecture , several open questions remain . by generalizing the gaussian noise model from thermal noise to general gaussian noise , we rigorously revisit and calculate these strong upper bounds on the information capacity for single - mode with general gaussian - noise channels . in this study , we use the quantum entropy power inequality ( qepi ) approach . this framework gives a new formula for finding upper bounds on the information capacity of bosonic gaussian channels .
