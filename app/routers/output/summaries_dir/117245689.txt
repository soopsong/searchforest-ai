we demonstrate that the entropy of entanglement and the distillable entanglement of regions with respect to the rest of a general harmonic lattice system in the ground or a thermal state scale at most as the boundary area of the region . this area law is rigorously proven to hold true in non - critical harmonic lattice system of arbitrary spatial dimension , for general finite - ranged harmonic interactions , regions of arbitrary shape and states of nonzero temperature . for nearest - neighbor interactions - corresponding to the klein - gordon case - upper and lower bounds to the degree of entanglement can be stated explicitly for arbitrarily shaped regions , generalizing the findings of [ phys . rev . lett . 94 , 060503 ( 2005 ) ] . these higher dimensional analogues of the analysis of block entropies in the one - dimensional case show that under general conditions , one can expect an area law for the entanglement in non - critical harmonic many - body systems . the proofs make use of methods from entanglement theory , as well as of results on matrix functions of block banded matrices . disordered systems are also considered . we moreover construct a class of examples for which the two - point correlation length diverges , yet still an area law can be proven to hold . we finally consider the scaling of classical correlations in a classical harmonic system and relate it to a quantum lattice system with a modified interaction . we briefly comment on a general relationship between criticality and area laws for the entropy of entanglement .
