particle creation leading to hawking radiation is produced by the changing gravitational field of the collapsing star . the two main initial conditions in the far past placed on the quantum field from which particles arise , are the hartle hawking vacuum and the unruh vacuum . the former leads to a time symmetric thermal bath of radiation , while the latter to a flux of radiation coming out of the collapsing star . the energy of hawking radiation in the interior of the collapsing star is negative and equal in magnitude to its value at future infinity . this work investigates the backreaction of hawking radiation on the interior of a gravitationally collapsing star , in a hartle - hawking initial vacuum . it shows that due to the negative energy hawking radiation in the interior , the collapse of the star stops at a finite radius , before the singularity and the event horizon of a black hole have a chance to form . that is , the star bounces instead of collapsing to a black hole . a trapped surface near the last stage of the star 's collapse to its minimum size may still exist temporarily . its formation depends on the details of collapse . results for the case of hawking flux of radiation with the unruh initial state , will be given in a companion paper ii .
