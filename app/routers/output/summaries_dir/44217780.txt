we study corner contributions to holographic entanglement entropy in non - conformal backgrounds : a kink for d2-branes as well as a cone and two different types of crease for d4-branes . unlike 2 + 1-dimensional cfts , the corner contribution to the holographic entanglement entropy of d2-branes exhibits a power law behaviour rather than a logarithmic term . however , the logarithmic term emerges in the holographic entanglement entropy of d4-branes . we identify the logarithmic term for a cone in d4-brane background as the universal contribution under appropriate limits and compare it with other physical quantities .
