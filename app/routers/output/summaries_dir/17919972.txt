we propose and analyze a circuit that implements a nonlinear coupling between two superconducting microwave resonators . the resonators are coupled through a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) that terminates one of the resonators . this produces a nonlinear interaction on the standard optomechanical form , where the quadrature of one resonator couples to the photon number of the other resonator . the circuit therefore allows for all - electrical realizations of analogs to optomechanical systems , with coupling that can be both strong and tunable . we estimate the coupling strengths that should be attainable with the proposed device , and we find that the device is a promising candidate for realizing the single - photon strong - coupling regime . as a potential application , we discuss implementations of networks of nonlinearly - coupled microwave resonators , which could be used in microwave - photon based quantum simulation .
