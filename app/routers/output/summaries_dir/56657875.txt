a quantum computer ( qc ) can solve many computational problems more efficiently than a classic one . the field of qcs is growing : companies ( such as dwave , ibm , google , and microsoft ) are building qc offerings . we position that software engineers should look into defining a set of software engineering practices that apply to qc 's software . to start this process , we give examples of challenges associated with testing such software and sketch potential solutions to some of these challenges .
