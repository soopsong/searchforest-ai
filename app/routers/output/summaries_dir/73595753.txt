we study entanglement entropy in free lifshitz scalar field theories holographically by employing the metrics proposed by nozaki , ryu and takayanagi in \cite{nozaki:2012zj } obtained from a continuous multi - scale entanglement renormalisation ansatz ( cmera ) . in these geometries we compute the minimal surface areas governing the entanglement entropy as functions of the dynamical exponent $ z$ and we exhibit a transition from an area law to a volume law analytically in the limit of large $ z$. we move on to explore the effects of a massive deformation , obtaining results for any $ z$ in arbitrary dimension . we then trigger a renormalisation group flow between a lifshitz theory and a conformal theory and observe a monotonic decrease in entanglement entropy along this flow . we focus on strip regions but also consider a disc in the undeformed theory .
