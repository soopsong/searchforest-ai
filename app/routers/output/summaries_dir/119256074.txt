trapped ions are pre - eminent candidates for building quantum information processors and quantum simulators . they have been used to demonstrate quantum gates and algorithms , quantum error correction , and basic quantum simulations . however , to realise the full potential of such systems and make scalable trapped - ion quantum computing a reality , there exist a number of practical problems which must be solved . these include tackling the observed high ion - heating rates and creating scalable trap structures which can be simply and reliably produced . here , we report on cryogenically operated silicon ion traps which can be rapidly and easily fabricated using standard semiconductor technologies . single $ ^{40}$ca$^+$ ions have been trapped and used to characterize the trap operation . long ion lifetimes were observed with the traps exhibiting heating rates as low as $ \dot{\bar{n}}=$ 0.33 phonons / s at an ion - electrode distance of 230 $ \mu$m . these results open many new avenues to arrays of micro - fabricated ion traps .
