liquid marbles are microlitre droplets of liquid , encapsulated by self - organised hydrophobic particles at the liquid / air interface . they offer an efficient approach for manipulating liquid droplets and compartmentalising reactions in droplets . digital fluidic devices employing liquid marbles might benefit from having embedded computing circuits without electronics and moving mechanical parts ( apart from the marbles ) . we present an experimental implementation of a collision gate with liquid marbles . mechanics of the gate follows principles of margolus ' soft - sphere collision gate . boolean values of the inputs are given by the absence ( false ) or presence ( true ) of a liquid marble . there are three outputs : two outputs are trajectories of undisturbed marbles ( they only report true when just one marble is present at one of the inputs ) , one output is represented by trajectories of colliding marbles ( when two marbles collide they lose their horizontal momentum and fall ) , this output reports true only when two marbles are present at inputs . thus the gate implements and and and - not logical functions . we speculate that by merging trajectories representing and - not output into a single channel one can produce a one - bit half - adder . potential design of a one - bit full - adder is discussed , and the synthesis of both a pure nickel metal and hybrid nickel / polymer liquid marble is reported .
