we introduce the characteristic operator as the generalization of the usual concept of a transfer function of linear input - plant - output systems to arbitrary quantum nonlinear markovian input - output models . this is intended as a tool in the characterization of quantum feedback control systems that fits in with the general theory of networks . the definition exploits the linearity of noise differentials in both the plant heisenberg equations of motion and the differential form of the input - output relations . mathematically , the characteristic operator is a matrix of dimension equal to the number of outputs times the number of inputs ( which must coincide ) , but with entries that are operators of the plant system . in this sense the characteristic operator retains details of the effective plant dynamical structure and is an essentially quantum object . we illustrate the relevance to model reduction and simplification by showing that the convergence of the characteristic operator in adiabatic elimination limit models requires the same conditions and assumptions appearing in the work on limit quantum stochastic differential theorems of bouten and silberfarb . this approach also shows in a natural way that the limit coefficients of the quantum stochastic differential equations in adiabatic elimination problems arise algebraically as schur complements , and amounts to a model reduction where the fast degrees of freedom are decoupled from the slow ones , and eliminated .
