we study a newtonian cosmological model in the context of a noncommutative space . it is shown that the trajectories of a test particle undergo modifications such that it no longer satisfies the cosmological principle . for the case of a positive cosmological constant , spiral trajectories are obtained and corrections to the hubble constant appear . it is also shown that , in the limit of a strong noncommutative parameter , the model is closely related to a particle in a g\"odel - type metric .
