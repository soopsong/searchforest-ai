universal unitary photonic devices can apply arbitrary unitary transformations to a vector of input modes and provide a promising hardware platform for fast and energy - efficient machine learning using light . we simulate the gradient - based optimization of random unitary matrices on universal photonic devices composed of imperfect tunable interferometers . if device components are initialized uniform - randomly , the locally - interacting nature of the mesh components biases the optimization search space towards banded unitary matrices , limiting convergence to random unitary matrices . we detail a procedure for initializing the device by sampling from the distribution of random unitary matrices and show that this greatly improves convergence speed . we also explore mesh architecture improvements such as adding extra tunable beamsplitters or permuting waveguide layers to further improve the training speed and scalability of these devices .
