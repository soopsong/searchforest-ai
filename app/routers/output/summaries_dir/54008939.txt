we study topological phenomena of quantum walks by implementing a novel protocol that extends the range of accessible properties to the eigenvalues of the walk operator . to this end , we experimentally realise for the first time a split - step quantum walk with decoupling , which allows for investigating the effect of a bulk - boundary while realising only a single bulk configuration . we approximate the symmetry protected edge states with high similarities and read out the phase relative to a reference for all modes . in this way we observe eigenvalues which are distinguished by the presence or absence of sign flips between steps . furthermore , the results show that investigating a bulk - boundary with a single bulk is experimentally feasible when decoupling the walk beforehand .
