we present a detailed analysis of a quantum memory for photons based on controlled and reversible inhomogeneous broadening ( crib ) . the explicit solution of the equations of motion is obtained in the weak excitation regime , making it possible to gain insight into the dependence of the memory efficiency on the optical depth , and on the width and shape of the atomic spectral distributions . we also study a simplified memory protocol which does not require any optical control fields .
