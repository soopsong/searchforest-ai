generalized quantum measurements ( povms or poms ) are important for optimally extracting information for quantum communication and computation . the standard realization via the neumark extension requires extensive resources in the form of operations in an extended hilbert space . for an arbitrary measurement , we show how to construct a binary search tree with a depth logarithmic in the number of possible outcomes . this could be implemented experimentally by coupling the measured quantum system to a probe qubit which is measured , and then iterating .
