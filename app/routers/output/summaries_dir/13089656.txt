general wisdom tells us that if two quantum states are ` ` macroscopically distinguishable ' ' then their superposition should be hard to observe . we make this intuition precise and general by quantifying the difficulty to observe the quantum nature of a superposition of two states that can be distinguished without microscopic accuracy . first , we quantify the distinguishability of any given pair of quantum states with measurement devices lacking microscopic accuracy , i.e. measurements suffering from limited resolution or limited sensitivity . next , we quantify the required stability that have to be fulfilled by any measurement setup able to distinguish their superposition from a mere mixture . finally , by establishing a relationship between the stability requirement and the ` ` macroscopic distinguishability ' ' of the two superposed states , we demonstrate that indeed , the more distinguishable the states are , the more demanding are the stability requirements .
