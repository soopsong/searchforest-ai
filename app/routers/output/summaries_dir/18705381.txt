a unitary operator that satisfies the constant yang - baxter equation immediately yields a unitary representation of the braid group b n for every $ n \ge 2$. if we view such an operator as a quantum - computational gate , then topological braiding corresponds to a quantum circuit . a basic question is when such a representation affords universal quantum computation . in this work , we show how to classically simulate these circuits when the gate in question belongs to certain families of solutions to the yang - baxter equation . these include all of the qubit ( i.e. , $ d = 2 $ ) solutions , and some simple families that include solutions for arbitrary $ d \ge 2$. our main tool is a probabilistic classical algorithm for efficient simulation of a more general class of quantum circuits . this algorithm may be of use outside the present setting .
