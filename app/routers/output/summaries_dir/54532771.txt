an ideal and reversible transfer technique for the quantum state between light and metastable collective states of matter is presented and analyzed in detail . the method is based on the control of photon propagation in coherently driven 3-level atomic media , in which the group velocity is adiabatically reduced to zero . form - stable coupled excitations of light and matter ( ` ` dark - state polaritons ' ' ) associated with the propagation of quantum fields in electromagnetically induced transparency are identified , their basic properties discussed and their application for quantum memories for light analyzed .
