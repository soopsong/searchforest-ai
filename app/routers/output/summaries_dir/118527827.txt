the quantum phase transition of the dicke - model has been observed recently in a system formed by motional excitations of a laser - driven bose -- einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity [ 1 ] . the cavity - based system is intrinsically open : photons can leak out of the cavity where they are detected . even at zero temperature , the continuous weak measurement of the photon number leads to an irreversible dynamics towards a steady - state which exhibits a dynamical quantum phase transition . however , whereas the critical point and the mean field is only slightly modified with respect to the phase transition in the ground state , the entanglement and the critical exponents of the singular quantum correlations are significantly different in the two cases .
