in this paper we develop a new approach to the investigation of the bi - partite entanglement entropy in integrable quantum spin chains . our method employs the well - known replica trick , thus taking a replica version of the spin chain model as starting point . at each site i of this new model we construct an operator t_i which acts as a cyclic permutation among the n replicas of the model . infinite products of t_i give rise to local operators , precursors of branch - point twist fields of quantum field theory . the entanglement entropy is then expressed in terms of correlation functions of such operators . employing this approach we investigate the von neumann and r\'enyi entropies of a particularly interesting quantum state occurring as a limit ( in a compact convergence topology ) of the antiferromagnetic xxz quantum spin chain . we find that , for large sizes , the entropy scales logarithmically , but not conformally .
