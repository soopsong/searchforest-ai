in this work we report on unusual nonlinear dynamics measured in the resonance response of nbn superconducting microwave resonators . the nonlinear dynamics , occurring at relatively low input powers ( 2 - 4 orders of magnitude lower than nb ) , and which include among others , jumps in the resonance lineshape , hysteresis loops changing direction and resonance frequency shift , are measured herein using varying input power , applied magnetic field , white noise and rapid frequency sweeps . based on these measurement results , we consider a hypothesis according to which local heating of weak links forming at the boundaries of the nbn grains are responsible for the observed behavior , and we show that most of the experimental results are qualitatively consistent with such hypothesis .
