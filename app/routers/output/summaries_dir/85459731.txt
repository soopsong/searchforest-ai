we present a quantum algorithm for simulating the wave equation under dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions . the algorithm uses hamiltonian simulation and quantum linear system algorithms as subroutines . it relies on factorizations of discretized laplacian operators to allow for improved scaling in truncation errors and improved scaling for state preparation relative to general purpose linear differential equation algorithms . we also consider using hamiltonian simulation for klein - gordon equations and maxwell 's equations .
