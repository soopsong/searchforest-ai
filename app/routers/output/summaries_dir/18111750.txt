the average effective resistance of a graph is a relevant performance index in many applications , including distributed estimation and control of network systems . in this paper , we study how the average resistance depends on the graph topology and specifically on the dimension of the graph . we concentrate on $ d$-dimensional toroidal grids and we exploit the connection between resistance and laplacian eigenvalues . our analysis provides tight estimates of the average resistance , which are key to study its asymptotic behavior when the number of nodes grows to infinity . in dimension two , the average resistance diverges : in this case , we are able to capture its rate of growth when the sides of the grid grow at different rates . in higher dimensions , the average resistance is bounded uniformly in the number of nodes : in this case , we conjecture that its value is of order $ 1 / d$ for large $ d$. we prove this fact for hypercubes and when the side lengths go to infinity .
