symmetric couplings among aggregates of $ n$ chromophores increase the transfer rate of excitons by a factor $ n^2 $ , a quantum mechanical phenomenon called"supertransfer . "in this work we demonstrate how supertransfer effects induced by geometrical symmetries can enhance the exciton diffusion length by a factor $ n$ along cylindrically symmetric structures , consisting of arrays of rings of chromophores , and along spiral arrays . we analyse both closed system dynamics and open quantum dynamics , modelled by combining a random bosonic bath with static disorder . in the closed system case , we use the symmetries of the system within a short - time approximation to obtain a closed analytical expression for the diffusion length that explicitly reveals the supertransfer contribution . when subject to disorder , we show that supertransfer can enhance excitonic diffusion lengths for small disorders and characterize the crossover from coherent to incoherent motion . owing to the quasi-1d nature of the model , disorder ultimately localizes the excitons , diminishing but not destroying the effects of supertransfer . when dephasing effects are included , we study the scaling of diffusion with both time and number of chromophores and observe that the transition from a coherent , ballistic regime to an incoherent , random - walk regime occurs at the same point as the change from supertransfer to classical scaling .
