correlated photons produced by spontaneous parametric down - conversion are an essential tool for quantum communication , especially suited for long - distance connections . to have a reasonable count rate after all the losses in the propagation and the filters needed to improve the coherence , it is convenient to increase the intensity of the laser that pumps the non - linear crystal . by doing so , however , the importance of the four - photon component of the down - converted field increases , thus degrading the quality of two - photon interferences . in this paper , we present an easy derivation of this nuisance valid for any form of entanglement generated by down - conversion , followed by a full study of the problem for time - bin entanglement . we find that the visibility of two - photon interferences decreases as v=1 - 2\rho , where \rho is , in usual situations , the probability per pulse of creating a detectable photon pair . in particular , the decrease of v is independent of the coherence of the four - photon term . thanks to the fact that \rho can be measured independently of v , the experimental verification of our prediction is provided for two different configuration of filters .
