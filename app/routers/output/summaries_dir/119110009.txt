we present several entanglement criteria in terms of the quantum fisher information that help to relate various forms of multipartite entanglement to the sensitivity of phase estimation . we show that genuine multipartite entanglement is necessary to reach the maximum sensitivity in some very general metrological tasks using a two - arm linear interferometer . we also show that it is needed to reach the maximum average sensitivity in a certain combination of such metrological tasks .
