we propose a scheme that can generate a tunable double optomechanically induced transparency ( omit ) in a hybrid optomechanical cavity system , in which the mechanical resonator of an optomechanical cavity is coupled to an additional mechanical resonator , and the additional mechanical resonator can be driven by a weak external coherently mechanical driving field . we show that both the intensity and the phase of the the external mechanical driving field can control the propagation of the probe field , including changing the transmission spectrum curve from a double - window to a single - window . our study also provides an effective way to produce an intensity - controllable narrow - bandwidth transmission spectra , with the probe field modulated from excessive opacity to remarkable amplification .
