mollow spectroscopy is a photon statistics spectroscopy , obtained by scanning the quantum light scattered from a source system . here , we apply this technique to detect the weak light - matter interaction between the cavity and atom ( or a mechanical oscillator ) when the strong system dissipation is included . we find that the weak interaction can be measured with high accuracy when exciting the target cavity by quantum light scattered from the source in the halfway between the central peak and each side peak . this originally comes from the strong correlation of the injected quantum photons . in principle , our proposal can be applied into the normal cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) system described by jc model and optomechanical system . furthermore , it is state - of - the - art for experiment even when the interaction strength is downed to a very small value .
