we study theoretically the nonstationary circuit qed system in which the artificial atom transition frequency , or the atom - cavity coupling , have a small periodic time modulation , prescribed externally . the system formed by the atom coupled to a single cavity mode is described by the rabi hamiltonian . we show that , in the dispersive regime , when the modulation periodicity is tuned to the ` resonances ' , the system dynamics presents the dynamical casimir effect , resonant jaynes - cummings or resonant anti - jaynes - cummings behaviors , and it can be described by the corresponding effective hamiltonians . in the resonant atom - cavity regime and under the resonant modulation , the dynamics is similar to the one occurring for a stationary two - level atom in a vibrating cavity , and an entangled state with two photons can be created from vacuum . moreover , we consider the situation in which the atom - cavity coupling , the atomic frequency , or both have a small nonperiodic time modulation , and show that photons can be created from vacuum in the dispersive regime . therefore , an analog of the dynamical casimir effect can be simulated in circuit qed , and several photons , as well as entangled states , can be generated from vacuum due to the anti - rotating term in the rabi hamiltonian .
