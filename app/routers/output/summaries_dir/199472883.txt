quantum computing ( qc ) has already entered the industrial landscape and several multinational corporations have initiated their own research efforts . so far , many of these efforts have been focusing on superconducting qubits , whose industrial progress is currently way ahead of all other qubit implementations . this paper briefly reviews the progress made on the silicon - based qc platform , which is highly promising to meet the scale - up challenges by leveraging the semiconductor industry . we look at different types of qubits , the advantages of silicon , and techniques for qubit manipulation in the solid state . finally , we discuss the possibility of co - integrating silicon qubits with fet - based , cooled front - end electronics , and review the device physics of mosfets at deep cryogenic temperatures .
