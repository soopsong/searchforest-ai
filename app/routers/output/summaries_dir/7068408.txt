the k - pair problem in network coding theory asks to send k messages simultaneously between k source - target pairs over a directed acyclic graph . in a previous paper [ icalp 2009 , part i , pages 622 - -633 ] the present authors showed that if a classical k - pair problem is solvable by means of a linear coding scheme , then the quantum k - pair problem over the same graph is also solvable , provided that classical communication can be sent for free between any pair of nodes of the graph . here we address the main case that remained open in our previous work , namely whether nonlinear classical network coding schemes can also give rise to quantum network coding schemes . this question is motivated by the fact that there are networks for which there are no linear solutions to the k - pair problem , whereas nonlinear solutions exist . in the present paper we overcome the limitation to linear protocols and describe a new communication protocol for perfect quantum network coding that improves over the previous one as follows : ( i ) the new protocol does not put any condition on the underlying classical coding scheme , that is , it can simulate nonlinear communication protocols as well , and ( ii ) the amount of classical communication sent in the protocol is significantly reduced .
