we report on the fabrication of quantum photonic integrated circuits based on suspended gaas membranes . the fabrication process consists of a single lithographic step followed by inductively - coupled - plasma dry etching through an electron - beam - resist mask and wet etching of a sacrificial layer . this method does not require depositing , etching , and stripping a hard mask , greatly reducing fabrication time and costs , while at the same time yielding devices of excellent structural quality . we discuss in detail the procedures for cleaning the resist residues caused by the plasma etching and present a statistical analysis of the etched feature size after each fabrication step .
