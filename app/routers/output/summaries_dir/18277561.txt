we introduce a new protocol , the channel - state coding protocol , to quantum shannon theory . this protocol generates entanglement between a sender and receiver by coding for a noisy quantum channel with the aid of a noisy shared state . the mother and father protocols arise as special cases of the channel - state coding protocol , where the channel is noiseless or the state is a noiseless maximally entangled state , respectively . the channel - state coding protocol paves the way for formulating entanglement - assisted quantum error - correcting codes that are robust to noise in shared entanglement . finally , the channel - state coding protocol leads to a smith - yard superactivation , where we can generate entanglement using a zero - capacity erasure channel and a non - distillable bound entangled state .
