we theoretically demonstrate that detectors endowed with internal gain and operated in regimes in which they do not necessarily behave as photon - counters , but still ensure linear input / output responses , can allow a self - consistent characterization of the statistics of the number of detected photons without need of knowing their gain . we present experiments performed with a photo - emissive hybrid detector on a number of classical fields endowed with non - trivial statistics and show that the method works for both microscopic and mesoscopic photon numbers . the obtained detected - photon probability distributions agree with those expected for the photon numbers , which are also reconstructed by an independent method .
