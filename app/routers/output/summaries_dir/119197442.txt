we propose a scheme to achieve a uniform cross phase modulation ( xpm ) for two nonclassical light pulses and study its application for quantum non - demolition measurements of the photon number in a pulse and for controlled phase gates in quantum information . we analyze the scheme by quantizing a common phenomenological model for classical xpm . our analysis first treats the ideal case of equal cross - phase modulation and pure unitary dynamics . this establishes the groundwork for more complicated studies of non - unitary dynamics and difference in phase shifts between the two pulses where decohering effects severely affect the performance of the scheme .
