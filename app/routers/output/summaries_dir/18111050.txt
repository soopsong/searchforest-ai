we suggest and investigate a scheme for non - deterministic noiseless linear amplification of coherent states using successive photon addition , $ ( \hat a^{\dagger})^2 $ , where $ \hat a^\dagger$ is the photon creation operator . we compare it with a previous proposal using the photon addition - then - subtraction , $ \hat a \hat a^\dagger$ , where $ \hat a$ is the photon annihilation operator , that works as an appropriate amplifier only for weak light fields . we show that when the amplitude of a coherent state is $ |\alpha| \gtrsim 0.91 $ , the $ ( \hat a^{\dagger})^2 $ operation serves as a more efficient amplifier compared to the $ \hat a \hat a^\dagger$ operation in terms of equivalent input noise . using $ \hat a \hat a^\dagger$ and $ ( \hat a^{\dagger})^2 $ as basic building blocks , we compare combinatorial amplifications of coherent states using $ ( \hat a \hat a^\dagger)^2 $ , $ \hat a^{\dagger 4}$ , $ \hat a \hat a^\dagger\hat a^{\dagger 2}$ , and $ \hat a^{\dagger 2}\hat a \hat a^\dagger$ , and show that $ ( \hat a \hat a^\dagger)^2 $ , $ \hat a^{\dagger 2}\hat a \hat a^\dagger$ , and $ \hat a^{\dagger 4}$ exhibit strongest noiseless properties for $ |\alpha| \lesssim 0.51 $ , $ 0.51 \lesssim |\alpha| \lesssim 1.05 $ , and $ |\alpha|\gtrsim 1.05 $ , respectively . we further show that the $ ( \hat a^{\dagger})^2 $ operation can be used for amplifying superpositions of the coherent states . in contrast to previous studies , our work provides efficient schemes to implement a noiseless amplifier for light fields with medium and large amplitudes .
