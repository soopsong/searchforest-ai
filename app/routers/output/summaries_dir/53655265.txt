it is well known that for two qubits the upper bounds of the relative entropy of entanglement ( ree ) for a given concurrence as well as the negativity for a given concurrence are reached by pure states . we show that , by contrast , there are two - qubit mixed states for which the ree for some range of a fixed negativity is higher than that for pure states . moreover , we demonstrate that a mixture of a pure entangled state and pure separable state orthogonal to it is likely to give the maximal ree . by noting that the negativity is a measure of entanglement cost under operations preserving positivity of partial transpose , our results provide an explicit example of operations such that , even though the entanglement cost for an exact preparation is the same , the entanglement of distillation of a mixed state can exceed that of pure states . this means that the entanglement manipulation via a pure state can result in a larger entanglement loss than that via a mixed state .
