we study the squeezing of output quadratures of an electro - magnetic field escaping from a resonator coupled to a general quantum system with arbitrary interaction strengths . the generalized theoretical analysis of output squeezing proposed here is valid for all the interaction regimes of cavity - quantum electrodynamics : from the weak to the strong , ultrastrong , and deep coupling regimes . for coupling rates comparable or larger then the cavity resonance frequency , the standard input - output theory for optical cavities fails to calculate the correct output field - quadratures and predicts a non - negligible amount of output squeezing , even if the system is in its ground state . here we show that , for arbitrary interactions and cavity - embedded quantum systems , no squeezing can be found in the output - field quadratures if the system is in its ground state . we also apply the proposed theoretical approach to study the output squeezing produced by : ( i ) an artificial two - level atom embedded in a coherently - excited cavity ; and ( ii ) a cascade - type three - level system interacting with a cavity field mode . in the latter case the output squeezing arises from the virtual photons of the atom - cavity dressed states . this work extends the possibility of predicting and analyzing continuous - variable optical quantum - state tomography when optical resonators interact very strongly with other quantum systems .
