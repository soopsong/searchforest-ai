recently p. wocjan and m. horodecki [ quant - ph/0503129 ] gave a characterization of combinatorially independent permutation separability criteria . combinatorial independence is a necessary condition for permutations to yield truly independent criteria meaning that that no criterion is strictly stronger that any other . in this paper we observe that some of these criteria are still dependent and analyze why these dependencies occur . to remove them we introduce an improved necessary condition and give a complete classification of the remaining permutations . we conjecture that the remaining class of criteria only contains truly independent permutation separability criteria . our conjecture is based on the proof that for two , three and four parties all these criteria are truly independent and on numerical verification of their independence for up to 8 parties . it was commonly believed that for three parties there were 9 independent criteria , here we prove that there are exactly 6 independent criteria for three parties and 22 for four parties .
