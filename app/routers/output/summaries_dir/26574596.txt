we review recent experimental progress towards quantum information processing and quantum simulation using neutral atoms in two - dimensional ( 2d ) arrays of optical microtraps as 2d registers of qubits . we describe a scalable quantum information architecture based on micro - fabricated optical elements , simultaneously targeting the important issues of single - site addressability and scalability . this approach provides flexible and integrable configurations for quantum state storage , manipulation , and retrieval . we present recent experimental results on the initialization and coherent one - qubit rotation of up to 100 individually addressable qubits , the coherent transport of atomic quantum states in a scalable quantum shift register , and discuss the feasibility of two - qubit gates in 2d microtrap arrays .
