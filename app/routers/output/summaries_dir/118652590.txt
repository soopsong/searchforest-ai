the fisher information $ f$ gives a limit to the ultimate precision achievable in a phase estimation protocol . it has been shown recently that the fisher information for a linear two - mode interferometer can not exceed the number of particles if the input state is separable . as a direct consequence , with such input states the shot - noise limit is the ultimate limit of precision . in this work , we go a step further by deducing bounds on $ f$ for several multiparticle entanglement classes . these bounds imply that genuine multiparticle entanglement is needed for reaching the highest sensitivities in quantum interferometry . we further compute similar bounds on the average fisher information $ \bar f$ for collective spin operators , where the average is performed over all possible spin directions . we show that these criteria detect different sets of states and illustrate their strengths by considering several examples , also using experimental data . in particular , the criterion based on $ \bar f$ is able to detect certain bound entangled states .
