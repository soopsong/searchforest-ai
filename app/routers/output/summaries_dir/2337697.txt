recently , several works have analysed the efficiency of photosynthetic complexes in a transient scenario and how that efficiency is affected by environmental noise . here , following a quantum master equation approach , we study the energy and excitation transport in fully connected networks both in general and in the particular case of the fenna - matthew - olson complex . the analysis is carried out for the steady state of the system where the excitation energy is constantly"flowing"through the system . steady state transport scenarios are particularly relevant if the evolution of the quantum system is not conditioned on the arrival of individual excitations . by adding dephasing to the system , we analyse the possibility of noise - enhancement of the quantum transport .
