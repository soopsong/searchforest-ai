the counter rotating - wave term ( crt ) effects from the system - bath coherence on the dynamics of quantum correlation of two qubits in two independent baths and a common bath are systematically investigated . the hierarchy approach is extended to solve the relevant spin boson models with the lorentzian spectrum , the exact dynamics for the quantum entanglement and quantum discord ( qd ) are evaluated , and the comparisons with previous ones under the rotating - wave approximation are performed . for the two independent baths , beyond the weak system - bath coupling , the crt essentially changes the evolution of both entanglement and qd . with the increase of the coupling , the revival of the entanglement is suppressed dramatically and finally disappears , and the qd becomes smaller monotonically . for the common bath , the entanglement is also suppressed by the crt , but the qd shows quite different behaviors , if initiated from the correlated bell states . in the non - markovian regime , the qd is almost not influenced by the crt and generally finite in the long time evolution at any coupling , while in the markovian regime , it is significantly enhanced with the strong coupling .
