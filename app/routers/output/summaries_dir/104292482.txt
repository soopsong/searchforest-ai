the advantage of using a single - photon two - mode entangled state in two - way communication via maximal violation of an inequality associated with the ` guess your neighbour 's input ' ( gyni ) game has been theoretically [ phys . rev . lett . 120 , 060503 ( 2018 ) ] as well as experimentally [ cleo fid.4 ( osa , 2018 ) ] established quite recently . we show that such an advantage can also be obtained using any single - mode pure non - classical state embedded in a two - mode pure entangled state , wherein the other mode is the vacuum ( henceforth referred to as a generalized noon state ) , regardless of the average photon number of the single mode state . for the special cases of the even - coherent , odd - coherent , and squeezed vacuum noon states , we establish that the advantage is also maximal . we show that the usage of the even - coherent noon states can provide an advantage under noisy apparatuses ( beam splitters and photo detectors ) . as an aside , we study how some of these states fare in terms of violation of a reference - frame independent bell - type inequality .
