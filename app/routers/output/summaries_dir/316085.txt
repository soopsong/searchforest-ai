this paper is concerned with a dissipativity theory for dynamical systems governed by linear ito stochastic differential equations driven by random noise with an uncertain drift . the deviation of the noise from a standard wiener process in the nominal model is quantified by relative entropy . we discuss a dissipation inequality for the noise relative entropy supply . the problem of minimizing the supply required to drive the system between given gaussian state distributions over a specified time horizon is considered . this problem , known in the literature as the schroedinger bridge , was treated previously in the context of reciprocal processes . a closed - form smooth solution is obtained for a hamilton - jacobi equation for the minimum required relative entropy supply by using nonlinear algebraic techniques .
