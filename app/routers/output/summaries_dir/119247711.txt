this paper provides some necessary and sufficient conditions for a generalmarkovian gaussian master equation to have a unique pure steady state . the conditions are described by simple matrix equations ; thus the so - called environment engineering problem for pure - gaussian - state preparation can be straightforwardly dealt with in the linear algebraic framework . in fact , based on one of those conditions , for an arbitrary given pure gaussian state , we obtain a complete parametrization of the gaussian master equation having that state as a unique steady state ; this leads to a systematic procedure for engineering a desired dissipative system.we demonstrate some examples including gaussian cluster states .
