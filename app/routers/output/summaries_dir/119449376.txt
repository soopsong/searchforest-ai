nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) provides an experimental setting to explore physical implementations of quantum information processing ( qip ) . here we introduce the basic background for understanding applications of nmr to qip and explain their current successes , limitations and potential . nmr spectroscopy is well known for its wealth of diverse coherent manipulations of spin dynamics . ideas and instrumentation from liquid state nmr spectroscopy have been used to experiment with qip . this approach has carried the field to a complexity of about 10 qubits , a small number for quantum computation but large enough for observing and better understanding the complexity of the quantum world . while liquid state nmr is the only present - day technology about to reach this number of qubits , further increases in complexity will require new methods . we sketch one direction leading towards a scalable quantum computer using spin 1/2 particles . the next step of which is a solid state nmr - based qip capable of reaching 10 - 30 qubits .
