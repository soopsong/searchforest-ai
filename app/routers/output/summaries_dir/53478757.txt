the fidelity between the state of a continuously observed quantum system and the state of its associated quantum filter , is shown to be always a submartingale . the observed system is assumed to be governed by a continuous - time stochastic master equation ( sme ) , driven simultaneously by wiener and poisson processes and that takes into account incompleteness and errors in measurements . this stability result is the continuous - time counterpart of a similar stability result already established for discrete - time quantum systems and where the measurement imperfections are modeled by a left stochastic matrix .
