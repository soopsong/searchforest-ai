we investigate the propagation of microwave photons in a one - dimensional open waveguide interacting with a number of artificial atoms ( qubits ) . within the formalism of projection operators and non - hermitian hamiltonian approach we develop a one - photon approximation scheme for the calculation of the transmission and reflection factors of the microwave signal in a waveguide which contains an arbitrary number \emph{n } of non - interacting qubits . we considered in detail the resonances and photon mediated entanglement for two and three qubits in a chain . we showed that in non markovian case the resonance widths , which define the decay rates of the entangled state , can be much smaller than the decay width of individual qubit . it is also shown that for identical qubits in the long wavelength limit a coherent superradiant state is formed with the width being equal to the sum of the widths of spontaneous transitions of \emph{n } individual qubits . the results obtained in the paper are of general nature and can be applied to any type of qubits . the specific properties of the qubit are only encoded in the two parameters : the qubit energy $ \omega$ and the rate of spontaneous emission $ \gamma$.
