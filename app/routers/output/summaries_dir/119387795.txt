a single - photon fock state has been generated by means of conditional preparation from a two - photon state emitted in the process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion . a recently developed high - frequency homodyne tomography technique has been used to completely characterize the fock state by means of a pulse - to - pulse analysis of the detectors ' difference photocurrent . the density matrix elements of the generated state have been retrieved with a final detection efficiency of about 57 % . a comparison has been performed between the phase - averaged tomographic reconstructions of the wigner function as obtained from the measured density - matrix elements and from a direct abel transform of the homodyne data . the ability of our system to work at the full repetition rate of the pulsed laser ( 82 mhz ) substantially simplifies the detection scheme , allowing for more ` ` exotic ' ' quantum states to be generated and analyzed .
