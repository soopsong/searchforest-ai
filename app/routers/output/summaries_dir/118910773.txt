we investigate the collective radiance characteristics of qubits in the ultrastrong coupling regime , where the radiance witness is defined based on the resonator - qubit dressed basis . the ultrastrong hyperradiance effect is demonstrated when the dressed state of system is resonantly driven . interestingly , we show that , besides the resonator - qubit coupling strength , the parity - symmetry - breaking induced cascade - transition can significantly enhance the collective radiance of qubits , which allows us to manipulate the transitions between subradiance , superradiance , and hyperradiance via adjusting the parity symmetry of system with an external magnetic field . this work extends the collective radiance theory to the ultrastrong coupling regime , and offers the potential applications in the engineering of new laser devices .
