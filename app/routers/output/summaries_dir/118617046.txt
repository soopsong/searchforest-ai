we report on an experiment that demonstrates the frequency up - conversion of telecommunication wavelength single - photon - level pulses to be resonant with a $ \mathrm{pr}^{3+}$:$\mathrm{y}_2\mathrm{si}\mathrm{o}_5 $ crystal . we convert the telecom photons at $ 1570\,\mathrm{nm}$ to $ 606\,\mathrm{nm}$ using a periodically - poled potassium titanyl phosphate nonlinear waveguide . the maximum device efficiency ( which includes all optical loss ) is inferred to be $ \eta_{\mathrm{dev}}^{\mathrm{max } } = 22 \pm 1\,%$ ( internal efficiency $ \eta_{\mathrm{int } } = 75\pm8\,%$ ) with a signal to noise ratio exceeding 1 for single - photon - level pulses with durations of up to 560$\,$ns . the converted light is then stored in the crystal using the atomic frequency comb scheme with storage and retrieval efficiencies exceeding $ \eta_{\mathrm{afc } } = 20\,%$ for predetermined storage times of up to $ 5\,\mu\mathrm{s}$. the retrieved light is time delayed from the noisy conversion process allowing us to measure a signal to noise ratio exceeding 100 with telecom single - photon - level inputs . these results represent the first demonstration of single - photon - level optical storage interfaced with frequency up - conversion .
