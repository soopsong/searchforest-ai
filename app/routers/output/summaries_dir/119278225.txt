the problem of construction of a quantum master equation for a system of sites weakly coupled to each other and to one or more reservoirs ( open quantum network ) is considered . microscopic derivation of a quantum master equation requires a diagonalization of the hamiltonian of the network , which can be a difficult task . when the inter - site couplings are weak , the local approach , which neglects the influence of the inter - site couplings on the system - reservoir couplings , is often used . recently , some doubts were cast to the consistency of the local approach . we develop a systematic perturbation expansion to derive corrections to the local approach and establish its range of validity . using this extension of the local approach , we derive an expression for the heat flux for a particular model and show that it does not violate the second law of thermodynamics .
