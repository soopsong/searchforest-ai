electro - optical sampling has been recently used to perform spectrally - resolved measurements of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations . in order to understand which information on the ground state of an interacting system can be acquired thanks to this technique , in this paper we will develop the quantum theory of electro - optical sampling in arbitrary dispersive dielectrics . our theory shows that a measure of the time correlations of the vacuum fluctuations effectively implements an ellipsometry measurement on the quantum vacuum , allowing to access the frequency - dependent dielectric function . we discuss consequences of these results on the possibility to use electro - optical sampling to probe the population of ground - state virtual photons in the ultrastrong light - matter coupling regime .
