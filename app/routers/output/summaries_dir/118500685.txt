the geodesics prescription in holographic approach in lorentzian signature is valid only for geodesics which connect spacelike - separated points at the boundary , since there are no timelike geodesics which reach the boundary . there is also no straightforward analytic euclidean continuation for a general background , such as e. g. moving particle in ads . we propose an improved geodesic image method for two - point lorentzian correlators which is valid for arbitrary time intervals in case of the bulk spacetime deformed by point particles . we illustrate that our prescription is consistent with the case when the analytic continuation exists and with the quasigeodesics prescription used in previous work . we also discuss some other applications of the improved image method , such as holographic entanglement entropy and multiple particles in ads3 .
