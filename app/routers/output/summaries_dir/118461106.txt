the study of quantum walks has been shown to have a wide range of applications in areas such as artificial intelligence , the study of biological processes , and quantum transport . the quantum stochastic walk , which allows for incoherent movement of the walker , and therefore , directionality , is a generalization on the fully coherent quantum walk . while a quantum stochastic walk can always be described in lindblad formalism , this does not mean that it can be microscopically derived in the standard weak - coupling limit under the born - markov approximation . this restricts the class of quantum stochastic walks that can be experimentally realized in a simple manner . to circumvent this restriction , we introduce a technique to simulate open system evolution on a fully coherent quantum computer , using a quantum trajectories style approach . we apply this technique to a broad class of quantum stochastic walks , and show that they can be simulated with minimal experimental resources . our work opens the path towards the experimental realization of quantum stochastic walks on large graphs with existing quantum technologies .
