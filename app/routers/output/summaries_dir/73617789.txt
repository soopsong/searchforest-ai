we examine an unruh - dewitt particle detector coupled to a scalar field in three - dimensional curved spacetime , within first - order perturbation theory . we first obtain a causal and manifestly regular expression for the instantaneous transition rate in an arbitrary hadamard state . we then specialise to the ba\~nados - teitelboim - zanelli black hole and to a massless conformally coupled field in the hartle - hawking vacuum . a co - rotating detector responds thermally in the expected local hawking temperature , while a freely - falling detector shows no evidence of thermality in regimes that we are able to probe , not even far from the horizon . the boundary condition at the asymptotically anti - de sitter infinity has a significant effect on the transition rate .
