we consider a variation of the spectral sparsification problem where we are required to keep a subgraph of the original graph . formally , given a union of two weighted graphs $ g$ and $ w$ and an integer $ k$ , we are asked to find a $ k$-edge weighted graph $ w_k$ such that $ g+w_k$ is a good spectral sparsifer of $ g+w$. we will refer to this problem as the subgraph ( spectral ) sparsification . we present a nontrivial condition on $ g$ and $ w$ such that a good sparsifier exists and give a polynomial time algorithm to find the sparsifer . % $ o(\frac{n}{k})\log n \tilde{o}(\log \log n)$ as a significant application of our technique , we show that for each positive integer $ k$ , every $ n$-vertex weighted graph has an $ ( n-1+k)$-edge spectral sparsifier with relative condition number at most $ \frac{n}{k } \log n \tilde{o}(\log\log n)$ where $ \tilde{o}()$ hides lower order terms . our bound is within a factor of $ \tilde{o}(\log \log n)$ from optimal . this nearly settles a question left open by spielman and teng about ultrasparsifiers , which is a key component in their nearly linear - time algorithms for solving diagonally dominant symmetric linear systems . we also present another application of our technique to spectral optimization in which the goal is to maximize the algebraic connectivity of a graph ( e.g. turn it into an expander ) with a limited number of edges .
