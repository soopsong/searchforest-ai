promising applications of the anisotropic quantum rabi model ( aqrm ) in broad parameter ranges are explored , which is realized with superconducting flux qubits simultaneously driven by two - tone time - dependent magnetic fields . regarding the quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) , with assistant of fidelity susceptibility , we extract the scaling functions and the critical exponents , with which the universal scaling of the cumulant ratio is captured with rescaling of the parameters due to the anisotropy . moreover , a fixed point of the cumulant ratio is predicted at the critical point of the aqrm . in respect to quantum information tasks , the generation of the macroscopic schr\"{o}dinger cat states and quantum controlled phase gates are investigated in the degenerate case of the aqrm , whose performance is also investigated by numerical calculation with practical parameters . therefore , our results pave a way to explore distinct features of the aqrm in circuit qed systems for qpts , quantum simulations and quantum information processings .
