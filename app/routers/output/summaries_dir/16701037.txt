we define a metric in the space of quantum states taking the monge distance between corresponding husimi distributions ( q -- functions ) . this quantity fulfills the axioms of a metric and satisfies the following semiclassical property : the distance between two coherent states is equal to the euclidean distance between corresponding points in the classical phase space . we compute analytically distances between certain states ( coherent , squeezed , fock and thermal ) and discuss a scheme for numerical computation of monge distance for two arbitrary quantum states .
