black hole complementarity requires that the interior of a black hole be represented by the same degrees of freedom that describe its exterior . entanglement plays a crucial role in the reconstruction of the interior degrees of freedom . this connection is manifest in"two - sided"eternal black holes . but for real black holes which are formed from collapse there are no second sides . the sense in which horizon entropy is entanglement entropy is much more subtle for one - sided black holes . it involves entanglement between different parts of the near - horizon system . as a one - sided black hole evaporates the entanglement that accounts for its interior degrees of freedom disappears , and is gradually replaced by entanglement with the outgoing hawking radiation . a principle of"transfer of entanglement"can be formulated . according to the argument of almheiri , marolf , polchinski and sully , it is when the transfer of entanglement is completed at the page time , that a firewall replaces the horizon . alternatives to firewalls may suffer contradictions which are similar to those of time travel . the firewall hypothesis would be similar to hawking 's chronology protection conjecture .
