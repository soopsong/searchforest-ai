i expand on some ideas from my recent review"string theory to the rescue,"i discuss my use of bayesian reasoning . i argue that it can be useful but that it is very far from the central point of the discussion . i then review my own personal history with the multiverse . finally i respond to some of the criticisms of ellis and silk , which initiated this interesting discussion .
