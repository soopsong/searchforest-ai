waveguide and resonant properties of diffractive structures are often explained through the complex poles of their scattering matrices . numerical methods for calculating poles of the scattering matrix with applications in grating theory are discussed . a new iterative method for computing the matrix poles is proposed . the method takes account of the scattering matrix form in the pole vicinity and relies upon solving matrix equations with use of matrix decompositions . using the same mathematical approach , we also describe a cauchy - integral - based method that allows all the poles in a specified domain to be calculated . calculation of the modes of a metal - dielectric diffraction grating shows that the iterative method proposed has the high rate of convergence and is numerically stable for large - dimension scattering matrices . an important advantage of the proposed method is that it usually converges to the nearest pole .
