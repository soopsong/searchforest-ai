in this paper , we present two new constructions of complex codebooks with multiplicative characters , additive characters and trace functions over finite fields , and determine the maximal cross - correlation amplitude of these codebooks . we prove that the codebooks we constructed are asymptotically optimal with respect to the welch bound . moreover , in the first construction , we generalize the result in [ 28 ] . in the second construction , we generalize the results in [ 12 ] , we can achieve welch bound for any odd prime p , we also derive the whole distribution of their inner products . the parameters of these codebooks are new .
