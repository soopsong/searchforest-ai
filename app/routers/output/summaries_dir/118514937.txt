in the last years the possibility of creating and manipulating quantum states of light has paved the way to the development of new technologies exploiting peculiar properties of quantum states , as quantum information , quantum metrology&sensing , quantum imaging ... in particular quantum imaging addresses the possibility of overcoming limits of classical optics by using quantum resources as entanglement or sub - poissonian statistics . albeit quantum imaging is a more recent field than other quantum technologies , e.g. quantum information , it is now substantially mature for application . several different protocols have been proposed , some of them only theoretically , others with an experimental implementation and a few of them pointing to a clear application . here we present a few of the most mature protocols ranging from ghost imaging to sub shot noise imaging and sub rayleigh imaging .
