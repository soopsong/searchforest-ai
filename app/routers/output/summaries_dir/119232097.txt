we realize a spin-1 dicke model using magnetic sub - levels of the lowest f=1 hyperfine level of $ ^{87}$rb atoms confined to a high finesse cavity . we study this system under conditions of imbalanced driving , which is predicted to have a rich phase diagram of nonequilibrium phases and phase transitions . we observe both super - radiant and oscillatory phases from the cavity output spectra as predicted by theory . exploring the system over a wide range of parameters , we obtain the boundaries between the normal , super - radiant and the oscillatory phases , and compare with a theoretical model .
