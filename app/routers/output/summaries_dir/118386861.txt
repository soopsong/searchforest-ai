we elaborate on the role of extremal surfaces probing the internal space in ads / cft . extremal surfaces in ads quantify the"geometric"entanglement between different regions in physical space for the dual cft . this , however , is just one of many ways to split a given system into subsectors , and extremal surfaces in the internal space should similarly quantify entanglement between subsectors of the theory . for the case of ads$_5\times$s$^5 $ , their area was interpreted as entanglement entropy between u(n ) and u(m ) subsectors of u(n+m ) n=4 sym . making this proposal precise is subtle for a number of reasons , the most obvious being that from the bulk one usually has access to gauge - invariant quantities only , while a split into subgroups is inherently gauge variant . we study n=4 sym on the coulomb branch , where some of the issues can be mitigated and the proposal can be sharpened . continuing back to the original ads$_5\times$s$^5 $ geometry , we obtain a modified proposal , based on the relation of the internal space to the r - symmetry group .
