we introduce a new approach for designing numerical schemes for stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) . the approach , which we have called direction and norm decomposition method , proposes to approximate the required solution $ x_t$ by integrating the system of coupled sdes that describes the evolution of the norm of $ x_t$ and its projection on the unit sphere . this allows us to develop an explicit scheme for stiff sdes with multiplicative noise that shows a solid performance in various numerical experiments . under general conditions , the new integrator preserves the almost sure stability of the solutions for any step - size , as well as the property of being distant from $ 0$. the scheme also has linear rate of weak convergence for a general class of sdes with locally lipschitz coefficients , and one - half strong order of convergence .
