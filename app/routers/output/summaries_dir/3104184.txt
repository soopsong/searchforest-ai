recently , almheiri , marolf , polchinski and sully ( amps ) have suggested a gedankenexperiment to test black hole complementarity . they claim that the postulates of black hole complementarity are mutually inconsistent and choose to give up the"absence of drama"for an infalling observer . according to them the black hole is shielded by a firewall no later than page time . this has generated some controversy . we find that an interesting picture emerges when we take into account objections from the advocates of fuzzballs . we reformulate amps ' gedankenexperiment in the decoherence picture of quantum mechanics and find that low energy wave packets interact with the radiation quanta rather violently while high energy wave packets do not . this is consistent with mathur 's recent proposal of fuzzball complementarity for high energy quanta falling into fuzzballs .
