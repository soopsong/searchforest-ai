we design optimal harmonic - trap trajectories to transport cold atoms without final excitation , combining an inverse engineering techniqe based on lewis - riesenfeld invariants with optimal control theory . since actual traps are not really harmonic , we keep the relative displacement between the center of mass and the trap center bounded . under this constraint , optimal protocols are found according to different physical criteria . the minimum time solution has a"bang - bang"form , and the minimum displacement solution is of"bang - off - bang"form . the optimal trajectories for minimizing the transient energy are also discussed .
