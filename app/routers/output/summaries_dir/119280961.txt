in this paper , we propose a resources - optimal linear - optical scheme for quantum nondemolition detection of single - photon presence . by measuring the state of ancillary photons , the presence of a photon in signal mode is revealed with a success probability of 1/2 without any disturbance to its state . we also show how to tune the setup to perform quantum nondemolition measurement of the signal photon state , and we provide tradeoff between the extracted information and the signal state disturbance . moreover , the optimality of resources and methods by which to increase the success probability are discussed .
