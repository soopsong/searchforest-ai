in this article we address the computational hardness of optimally decoding a quantum stabilizer code . much like classical linear codes , errors are detected by measuring certain check operators which yield an error syndrome , and the decoding problem consists of determining the most likely recovery given the syndrome . the corresponding classical problem is known to be np - complete , and a similar decoding problem for quantum codes is also known to be np - complete . however , this decoding strategy is not optimal in the quantum setting as it does not take into account error degeneracy , which causes distinct errors to have the same effect on the code . here , we show that optimal decoding of stabilizer codes is computationally much harder than optimal decoding of classical linear codes , it is # p.
