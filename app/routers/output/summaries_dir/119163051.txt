" quantum conversation"is a way in which two parties can communicate classical information with each other using entanglement as a shared resource . we present this scheme using a multipartite entangled state after describing its generation through appropriate circuit diagrams . we make use of a discrimination scheme which allows one to perform a measurement on the system without destroying its entanglement . we later prove that this scheme is secure in a noiseless and a lossless quantum channel .
