manipulating a database system on a quantum computer is an essential aim to benefit from the promising speed - up of quantum computers over classical computers in areas that take a vast amount of storage and processing time such as in databases . in this paper , the basic operations for manipulating the data in a quantum database will be defined , e.g. insert , update , delete , select , backing up and restoring a database file . this gives the ability to perform the data processing that usually takes a long processing time on a classical database system , in a simultaneous way on a quantum computer . defining a quantum version of more advanced concepts used in database systems , e.g. the referential integrity and the relational algebra , is a normal extension to this work
