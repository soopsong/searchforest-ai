following the work of kawai , matsuo , and yokokura , we study the dynamical collapsing process with spherical symmetry in the time - dependent space - time background including the back reaction of hawking radiation . we show that in this model there are two classes of asymptotic solutions . one of the two classes is known previously . these states have the slope $ \partial a/\partial r$ approximately equal to 1 . the other class of asymptotic solutions is that of shells with a small thickness . we emphasize that these thin shells should be properly understood as configurations in the low - energy effective theory . they behave characteristically differently from the singular states of ideal thin shells of zero thickness .
