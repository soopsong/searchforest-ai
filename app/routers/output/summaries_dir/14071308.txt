quantum communication systems harness modern physics through state - of - the - art optical engineering to provide revolutionary capabilities . an important concern for quantum communication engineering is designing and prototyping these systems to evaluate proposed capabilities . we apply the paradigm of software - defined communication for engineering quantum communication systems to facilitate rapid prototyping and prototype comparisons . we detail how to decompose quantum communication terminals into functional layers defining hardware , software , and middleware concerns , and we describe how each layer behaves . using the super - dense coding protocol as an example , we describe implementations of both the transmitter and receiver , and we present results from numerical simulations of the behavior . we conclude that software - defined quantum communication provides a robust framework in which to explore the large design space offered by this new regime of communication .
