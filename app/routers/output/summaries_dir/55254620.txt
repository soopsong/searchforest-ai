cooperative spontaneous emission of a single photon from a cloud of n atoms modifies substantially the radiation pressure exerted by a far - detuned laser beam exciting the atoms . on one hand , the force induced by photon absorption depends on the collective decay rate of the excited atomic state . on the other hand , directional spontaneous emission counteracts the recoil induced by the absorption . we derive an analytical expression for the radiation pressure in steady - state . for a smooth extended atomic distribution we show that the radiation pressure depends on the atom number via cooperative scattering and that , for certain atom numbers , it can be suppressed or enhanced .
