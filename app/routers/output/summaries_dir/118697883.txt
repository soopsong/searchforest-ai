we used a spectroscopic microwave technique utilizing superconducting stripline resonators at frequencies between 3 ghz and 15 ghz to examine the charge dynamics of ybrh2si2 at temperatures and magnetic fields close to the quantum critical point . the different electronic phases of this heavy - fermion compound , in particular the antiferromagnetic , fermi - liquid , and non - fermi - liquid regimes , were probed with temperature - dependent microwave measurements between 40 mk and 600 mk at a set of different magnetic fields up to 140 mt . signatures of phase transitions were observed , which give information about the dynamic response of this peculiar material that exhibits field - tuned quantum criticality and pronounced deviations from fermi - liquid theory .
