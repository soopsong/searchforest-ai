in this paper , we derive the minimum - energy periodic control that entrains an ensemble of structurally similar neural oscillators to a desired frequency . the state space representation of a nominal oscillator is reduced to a phase model by computing its limit cycle and phase response curve , from which the optimal control is derived by using formal averaging and the calculus of variations . we focus on the case of a 1:1 entrainment ratio , and introduce a numerical method for approximating the optimal controls . the method is applied to asymptotically control the spiking frequency of neural oscillators modeled using the hodgkin - huxley equations . this illustrates the optimality of entrainment controls derived using phase models when applied to the original state space system , which is a crucial requirement for using phase models in control synthesis for practical applications . the results of this work can be used to design low energy signals for deep brain stimulation therapies for neuropathologies , and can be generalized for optimal frequency control of large - scale complex oscillating systems with parameter uncertainty .
