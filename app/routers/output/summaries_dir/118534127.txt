we address the dynamics of a two - qubit system interacting with a classical dephasing environment driven by a gaussian stochastic process . upon introducing the concept of entanglement - preserving time , we compare the degrading effects of different environments , e.g. those described by ornstein - uhlenbeck or fractional noise . in particular , we consider pure bell states and mixtures of bell states and study the typical values of the entanglement - preserving time for both independent and common environments . we found that engineering environments towards fractional gaussian noise is useful to preserve entanglement as well as to improve its robustness against noise . we also address entanglement sudden death by studying the entanglement - survival time as a function of the initial negativity . we found that : i ) the survival time is bounded from below by an increasing function of the initial negativity , ii ) the survival time depends only slightly on the process used to describe the environment and exhibits typicality . overall , our results show that engineering the environment has only a slight influence over the entanglement - survival time , i.e. the occurence of entanglement sudden - death , while it represents a valuable resource to increase the entanglement - preserving time , i.e. to maintain entanglement closer to the initial level for a longer interaction time .
