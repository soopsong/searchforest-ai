a controlled quantum system possesses a search landscape defined by the target physical objective as a function of the controls . this paper focuses on the landscape for the transition probability pif between the states of a finite level quantum system . traditionally , the controls are applied fields ; here we extend the notion of control to also include the hamiltonian structure , in the form of time independent matrix elements . level sets of controls that produce the same transition probability value are shown to exist at the bottom pif = 0.0 and top pif = 1.0 of the landscape with the field and/or hamiltonian structure as controls . we present an algorithm to continuously explore these level sets starting from an initial point residing at either extreme value of pif . the technique can also identify control solutions that exhibit the desirable properties of ( a ) robustness at the top and ( b ) the ability to rapidly rise towards an optimal control from the bottom . numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the varied control behavior at the top and bottom of the landscape for several simple model systems .
