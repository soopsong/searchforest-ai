for many completely positive maps repeated compositions will eventually become entanglement breaking . to quantify this behaviour we develop a technique based on the schmidt number : if a completely positive map breaks the entanglement with respect to any qubit ancilla , then applying it to part of a bipartite quantum state will result in a schmidt number bounded away from the maximum possible value . iterating this result puts a successively decreasing upper bound on the schmidt number arising in this way from compositions of such a map . by applying this technique to completely positive maps in dimension three that are also completely copositive we prove the so called ppt squared conjecture in this dimension . we then give more examples of completely positive maps where our technique can be applied , e.g.~maps close to the completely depolarizing map , and maps of low rank . finally , we study the ppt squared conjecture in more detail , establishing equivalent conjectures related to other parts of quantum information theory , and we prove the conjecture for gaussian quantum channels .
