we reduce the number of open additivity problems in quantum information theory by showing that four of them are equivalent . we show that the conjectures of additivity of the minimum output entropy of a quantum channel , additivity of the holevo expression for the classical capacity of a quantum channel , additivity of the entanglement of formation , and strong superadditivity of the entanglement of formation , are either all true or all false .
