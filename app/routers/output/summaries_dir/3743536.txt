quantum repeater networks are a fundamental of any future quantum internet and long - distance quantum communications . the entangled quantum nodes can communicate through several different levels of entanglement , leading to a heterogeneous , multi - level network structure . the level of entanglement between the quantum nodes determines the hop distance and the probability of the existence of an entangled link in the network . here , we define a decentralized routing for entangled quantum networks . the proposed method allows an efficient routing to find the shortest paths in entangled quantum networks by using only local knowledge of the quantum nodes . we give bounds on the maximum value of the total number of entangled links of a path . the proposed scheme can be directly applied in practical quantum communications and quantum networking scenarios .
