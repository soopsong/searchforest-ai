we study the occupation fluctuations of drifted brownian motion in a closed interval , and show that they undergo a dynamical phase transition in the long - time limit without an additional low - noise limit . this phase transition is similar to wetting and depinning transitions , and arises here as a switching between paths of the random motion leading to different occupations . for low occupations , the motion essentially stays in the interval for some fraction of time before escaping , while for high occupations the motion is confined in an ergodic way in the interval . this is confirmed by studying a confined version of the model , which points to a further link between the dynamical phase transition and quantum phase transitions . other variations of the model , including the geometric brownian motion used in finance , are considered to discuss the role of recurrent and transient motion in dynamical phase transitions .
