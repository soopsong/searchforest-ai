we study majorana bound states in a disordered chain of semiconductor quantum dots proximity - coupled to an s - wave superconductor . by calculating its topological quantum number , based on the scattering - matrix method and a tight - binding model , we can identify the topological property of such an inhomogeneous one - dimensional system . we study the robustness of majorana bound states against disorder in both the spin - independent terms ( including the chemical potential and the regular spin - conserving hopping ) and the spin - dependent term , i.e. , the spin - flip hopping due to the rashba spin - orbit coupling . we find that the majorana bound states are not completely immune to the spin - independent disorder , especially when the latter is strong . meanwhile , the majorana bound states are relatively robust against spin - dependent disorder , as long as the spin - flip hopping is of uniform sign ( i.e. , the varying spin - flip hopping term does not change its sign along the chain ) . nevertheless , when the disorder induces sign - flip in spin - flip hopping , the topological - nontopological phase transition takes place in the low - chemical - potential region .
