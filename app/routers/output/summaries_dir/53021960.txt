we investigate the quantum synchronization phenomena of two mechanical oscillators of different frequencies in two optomechanical systems under periodically modulating cavity detunings or driving amplitudes , which can interact mutually through an optical fiber or a phonon tunneling . the cavities are filled with kerr - type nonlinear medium . it is found that , no matter which the coupling and periodically modulation we choose , both of the quantum synchronization of nonlinear optomechanical system are more appealing than the linear optomechanical system . it is easier to observe greatly enhanced quantum synchronization with kerr nonlinearity . in addition , the different influences on the quantum synchronization between the two coupling ways and the two modulating ways are compared and discussed .
