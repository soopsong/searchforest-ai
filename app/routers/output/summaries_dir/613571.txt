the classical lambda calculus may be regarded both as a programming language and as a formal algebraic system for reasoning about computation . it provides a computational model equivalent to the turing machine , and continues to be of enormous benefit in the classical theory of computation . we propose that quantum computation , like its classical counterpart , may benefit from a version of the lambda calculus suitable for expressing and reasoning about quantum algorithms . in this paper we develop a quantum lambda calculus as an alternative model of quantum computation , which combines some of the benefits of both the quantum turing machine and the quantum circuit models . the calculus turns out to be closely related to the linear lambda calculi used in the study of linear logic . we set up a computational model and an equational proof system for this calculus , and we argue that it is equivalent to the quantum turing machine .
