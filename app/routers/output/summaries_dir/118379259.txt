achieving effectively adiabatic dynamics in finite time is a ubiquitous goal in virtually all areas of modern physics . so - called shortcuts to adiabaticity refer to a set of methods and techniques that allow to produce in a short time the same final state that would result from an adiabatic , infinitely slow process . in the present work we generalize one of these methods -- the fast - forward technique -- to driven dirac dynamics . as a main result we find that shortcuts to adiababticity for the $ ( 1 + 1)$-dimensional dirac equation are facilitated by a combination of both , scalar and pseudoscalar potentials . our findings are illustrated for two analytically solvable examples , namely charged particles driven in spatially homogeneous and linear vector fields .
