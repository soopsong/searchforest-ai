taking the decoherence into account , we investigate nonclassical features of the optical schr\"odinger cat states in one mode and two coupled - modes systems with two - photon driving . in the one mode system , the relationship between the schr\"odinger cat states and the system parameters is derived . we observe that in the presence of single - photon decay the steady states would be a mixture of schr\"odinger cats . the dynamics and steady states of such a cat versus single - photon decay are examined . in the two coupled - modes cases with linear and nonlinear couplings , the dynamics of entanglement and mutual information are examined with two different initial states and single - photon decay . compared to the linear coupling case , more complicated structure appears in the wigner function in the nonlinear coupling case . the joint quadrature distributions are also explored . such nonclassical states can be used not only in exploring the boundary between the classical and the quantum worlds but also in quantum metrology and quantum information processing .
