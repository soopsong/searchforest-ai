we generalize the dispersive theory of the jaynes - cummings model beyond the frequently employed rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) in the coupling between the two - level system and the resonator . for a detuning sufficiently larger than the qubit - oscillator coupling , we diagonalize the non - rwa hamiltonian and discuss the differences to the known rwa results . our results extend the regime in which dispersive qubit readout is possible . if several qubits are coupled to one resonator , an effective qubit - qubit interaction of ising type emerges , whereas rwa leads to isotropic interaction . this impacts on the entanglement characteristics of the qubits .
