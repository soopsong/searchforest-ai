light forces induced by scattering and absorption in elastic dielectrics lead to local density modulations and deformations . these perturbations in turn modify light propagation in the medium and generate an intricate nonlinear response . we generalise an analytic approach where light propagation in one - dimensional media of inhomogeneous density is modelled as a result of multiple scattering between polarizable slices . using the maxwell stress tensor formalism we compute the local optical forces and iteratively approach self - consistent density distributions where the elastic back - action balances gradient- and scattering forces . for an optically trapped dielectric we derive the nonlinear dependence of trap position , stiffness and total deformation on the object 's size and field configuration . generally trapping is enhanced by deformation , which exhibits a periodic change between stretching and compression . this strongly deviates from qualitative expectations based on the change of photon momentum of light crossing the surface of a dielectric . we conclude that optical forces have to be treated as volumetric forces and that a description using the change of photon momentum at the surface of a medium is inappropriate .
