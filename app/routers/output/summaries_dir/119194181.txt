we investigate phase - insensitive linear amplification at the quantum limit for single- and two - mode states and show that there exists a broad class of non - gaussian states whose nonclassicality survives even at an arbitrarily large gain . we identify the corresponding observable nonclassical effects and find that they include , remarkably , two - mode entanglement . the implications of our results for quantum cloning outside the gaussian regime are also addressed .
