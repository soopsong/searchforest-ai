we put forward a quantum - optical model for a thermal diode based on heat transfer between two thermal baths through a pair of interacting qubits . we find that if the qubits are coupled by a raman field that induces an anisotropic interaction , heat flow can become non - reciprocal and undergoes rectification even if the baths have equal dissipation rates and/or the qubits are resonant . the heat flow rectification is explained by four - wave mixing and raman transitions between dressed states of the interacting qubits and are governed by a global master equation . the anisotropic two - qubit interaction is the key for this present simple quantum thermal diode , whose resonant operation allows for high - efficiency rectification of large heat currents . effects of spatial overlap of the baths are addressed . we also discuss the possible realizations of the model system in various platforms including optomechanical systems , systems of trapped ions , and circuit qed .
