we propose a digital - analog quantum simulation of generalized dicke models with superconducting circuits , including fermi - bose condensates , biased and pulsed dicke models , for all regimes of light - matter coupling . we encode these classes of problems in a set of superconducting qubits coupled with a bosonic mode implemented by a transmission line resonator . via digital - analog techniques , an efficient quantum simulation can be performed in state - of - the - art circuit quantum electrodynamics platforms , by suitable decomposition into analog qubit - bosonic blocks and collective single - qubit pulses through digital steps . moreover , just a single global analog block would be needed during the whole protocol in most of the cases , superimposed with fast periodic pulses to rotate and detune the qubits . therefore , a large number of digital steps may be attained with this approach , providing a reduced digital error . additionally , the number of gates per digital step does not grow with the number of qubits , rendering the simulation efficient . this strategy paves the way for the scalable digital - analog quantum simulation of many - body dynamics involving bosonic modes and spin degrees of freedom with superconducting circuits .
