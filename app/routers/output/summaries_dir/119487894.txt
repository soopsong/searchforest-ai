based on correlations of coherently displaced photon - numbers , we derive entanglement criteria for the purpose to verify non - gaussian entanglement . our construction method enables us to verify bipartite and multipartite entanglement of complex states of light . an important advantage of our technique is that the certified entanglement even persists in the presence of arbitrarily high , constant losses . we exploit experimental correlation schemes for the two - mode and multimode scenarios , which allow us to directly measure the desired observables . to detect entanglement of a given state , a genetic algorithm is applied to optimize over the infinite set of our constructed witnesses . in particular , we provide suitable witnesses for several distinct two - mode states . moreover , a mixed non - gaussian four - mode state is shown to be entangled in all possible non - trivial partitions .
