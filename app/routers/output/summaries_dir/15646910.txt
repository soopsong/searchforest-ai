various notions from geometric control theory are used to characterize the behavior of the markovian master equation for n - level quantum mechanical systems driven by unitary control and to describe the structure of the sets of reachable states . it is shown that the system can be accessible but neither small - time controllable nor controllable in finite time . in particular , if the generators of quantum dynamical semigroups are unital , then the reachable sets admit easy characterizations as they monotonically grow in time . the two level case is treated in detail .
