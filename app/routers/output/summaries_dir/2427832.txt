quantum algorithms are known for providing more efficient solutions to certain computational tasks than any corresponding classical algorithm . here we show that a single qudit is sufficient to implement an oracle based quantum algorithm , which can solve a black - box problem faster than any classical algorithm . for $ 2d$ permutation functions defined on a set of $ d$ elements , deciding whether a given permutation is even or odd , requires evaluation of the function for at least two elements . we demonstrate that a quantum circuit with a single qudit can determine the parity of the permutation with only one evaluation of the function . our algorithm provides an example for quantum computation without entanglement since it makes use of the pure state of a qudit . we also present an experimental realization of the proposed quantum algorithm with a quadrupolar nuclear magnetic resonance using a single four - level quantum system , i.e. , a ququart .
