we study how quantum and thermal noise affects synchronization of two optomechanical limit - cycle oscillators . classically , in the absence of noise , optomechanical systems tend to synchronize either in - phase or anti - phase . taking into account the fundamental quantum noise , we find a regime where fluctuations drive transitions between these classical synchronization states . we investigate how this"mixed"synchronization regime emerges from the noiseless system by studying the classical - to - quantum crossover and we show how the time scales of the transitions vary with the effective noise strength . in addition , we compare the effects of thermal noise to the effects of quantum noise .
