we show that quantum walks interpolate between a coherent ` wave walk ' and a random walk depending on how strongly the walker 's coin state is measured ; i.e. , the quantum walk exhibits the quintessentially quantum property of complementarity , which is manifested as a trade - off between knowledge of which path the walker takes vs the sharpness of the interference pattern . a physical implementation of a quantum walk ( the quantum quincunx ) should thus have an identifiable walker and the capacity to demonstrate the interpolation between wave walk and random walk depending on the strength of measurement .
