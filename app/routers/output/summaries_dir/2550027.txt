we consider platoons composed of identical vehicles and controlled in a distributed way , that is , each vehicle has its own onboard controller . the regulation errors in spacing to the immediately preceeding and following vehicles are weighted differently by the onboard controller , which thus implements an asymmetric bidirectional control scheme . the weights can vary along the platoon . we prove that such platoons have a nonzero uniform bound on the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph laplacian matrix - the fiedler eigenvalue . furthermore , it is shown that existence of this bound always signals undesirable scaling properties of the platoon . namely , the h - infinity norm of the transfer function of the platoon grows exponentially with the number of vehicles regardless of the controllers used . hence the benefits of a uniform gap in the spectrum of a laplacian with an asymetric distributed controller are paid for by poor scaling as the number of vehicles grows .
