we study the tuning curve of entangled photons generated by type-0 spontaneous parametric down - conversion in a periodically poled ktp crystal . we demonstrate the x - shaped spatiotemporal structure of the spectrum by means of measurements and numerical simulations . experiments for different pump waists , crystal temperatures , and crystal lengths are in good agreement with numerical simulations .
