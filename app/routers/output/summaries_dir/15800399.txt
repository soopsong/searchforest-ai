a one - way quantum computer works by only performing a sequence of one - qubit measurements on a particular entangled multi - qubit state , the cluster state . no non - local operations are required in the process of computation . any quantum logic network can be simulated on the one - way quantum computer . on the other hand , the network model of quantum computation can not explain all ways of processing quantum information possible with the one - way quantum computer . in this paper , two examples of the non - network character of the one - way quantum computer are given . first , circuits in the clifford group can be performed in a single time step . second , the realisation of a particular circuit --the bit - reversal gate-- on the one - way quantum computer has no network interpretation .
