we present a novel approach called the intermediate rotating wave approximation ( irwa ) , which employs a time - averaging method to encapsulate the dynamics of light - matter interaction from strong to ultrastrong coupling regime . in contrast to the ordinary rotating wave approximation , this method addresses the co - rotating and counter - rotating terms separately to trace their physical consequences individually , and thus establishes the continuity between the jaynes - cummings model and the quantum rabi model . we investigate irwa in near resonance and large detuning cases . our irwa not only agrees well with both models in their respective coupling strengths , but also offers a good explanation for their differences .
