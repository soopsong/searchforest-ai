a fast and automated scheme for general polarization transformations holds great value in adaptive optics , quantum information , and virtually all applications involving light - matter and light - light interactions . we present an experiment that uses a liquid crystal on silicon spatial light modulator ( lcos - slm ) to perform polarization transformations on a light field . we experimentally demonstrate the point - by - point conversion of uniformly polarized light fields across the wave front to realize arbitrary , spatially varying polarization states . additionally , we demonstrate that a light field with an arbitrary spatially varying polarization can be transformed to a spatially invariant ( i.e. , uniform ) polarization .
