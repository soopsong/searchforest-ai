quantum probing consists of suitably exploiting a simple , small , and controllable quantum system to characterize a larger and more complex system . here , we address the estimation of the cutoff frequency of the ohmic spectral density of a harmonic reservoir by quantum probes . to this aim , we address the use of single - qubit and two - qubit systems and different kinds of coupling with the bath of oscillators . we assess the estimation precision by the quantum fisher information of the sole quantum probe as well as the corresponding quantum signal - to - noise ratio . we prove that , for most of the values of the ohmicity parameter , a simple probe such as a single qubit is already optimal for the precise estimation of the cutoff frequency . indeed for those values , upon considering a two - qubit probe either in a bell or in separable state , we do not find improvement to the estimation precision . however , we also showed that there exist few conditions where employing two qubits in a bell state interacting with a common bath is more suitable for precisely estimating the cutoff frequency .
