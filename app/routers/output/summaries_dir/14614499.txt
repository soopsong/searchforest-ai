reversible logic represents the basis for many emerging technologies and has recently been intensively studied . however , most of the boolean functions of practical interest are irreversible and must be embedded into a reversible function before they can be synthesized . thus far , an optimal embedding is guaranteed only for small functions , whereas a significant overhead results when large functions are considered . in this paper , we study this issue . we prove that determining an optimal embedding is conp - hard already for restricted cases . then , we propose heuristic and exact methods for determining both the number of additional lines as well as a corresponding embedding . for the approaches we considered sums of products and binary decision diagrams as function representations . experimental evaluations show the applicability of the approaches for large functions . consequently , the reversible embedding of large functions is enabled as a precursor to subsequent synthesis .
