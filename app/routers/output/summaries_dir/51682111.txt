in quantum cryptography , device - independent ( di ) protocols can be certified secure without requiring assumptions about the inner workings of the devices used to perform the protocol . in order to display nonlocality , which is an essential feature in di protocols , the device must consist of at least two separate components sharing entanglement . this raises a fundamental question : how much entanglement is needed to run such di protocols ? we present a two - device protocol for di random number generation ( dirng ) which produces approximately $ n$ bits of randomness starting from $ n$ pairs of arbitrarily weakly entangled qubits . we also consider a variant of the protocol where $ m$ singlet states are diluted into $ n$ partially entangled states before performing the first protocol , and show that the number $ m$ of singlet states need only scale sublinearly with the number $ n$ of random bits produced . operationally , this leads to a dirng protocol between distant laboratories that requires only a sublinear amount of quantum communication to prepare the devices .
