noisy intermediate - scale quantum ( nisq ) computers have gate errors and decoherence , limiting the depth of circuits that can be implemented on them . a strategy for nisq algorithms is to reduce the circuit depth at the expense of increasing the qubit count . here , we exploit this trade - off for an application called entanglement spectroscopy , where one computes the entanglement of a state $ | \psi \rangle$ on systems $ ab$ by evaluating the r\'enyi entropy of the reduced state $ \rho_a = { \rm tr}_b(| \psi \rangle \langle \psi |)$. for a $ k$-qubit state $ \rho(k)$ , the r\'enyi entropy of order $ n$ is computed via $ { \rm tr}(\rho(k)^{n})$ , with the complexity growing exponentially in $ k$ for classical computers . johri , steiger , and troyer [ prb 96 , 195136 ( 2017 ) ] introduced a quantum algorithm that requires $ n$ copies of $ | \psi \rangle$ and whose depth scales linearly in $ k*n$. here , we present a quantum algorithm requiring twice the qubit resources ( $ 2n$ copies of $ | \psi \rangle$ ) but with a depth that is independent of both $ k$ and $ n$. surprisingly this depth is only two gates . our numerical simulations show that this short depth leads to an increased robustness to noise .
