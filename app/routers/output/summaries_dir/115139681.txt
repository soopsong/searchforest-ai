i present an extensible experimental design for optical continuous - variable cluster states of arbitrary size using four offline ( vacuum ) squeezers and six beamsplitters . this method has all the advantages of a temporal - mode encoding [ phys . rev . lett . 104 , 250503 ] , including finite requirements for coherence and stability even as the computation length increases indefinitely , with none of the difficulty of inline squeezing . the extensibility stems from a construction based on gaussian projected entangled pair states ( gpeps ) . the potential for use of this design within a fully fault tolerant model is discussed .
