we first consider various methods for the indirect implementation of unitary gates . we apply these methods to rederive the universality of 4-qubit measurements based on a scheme much simpler than nielsen 's original construction [ quant - ph/0108020 ] . then , we prove the universality of simple discrete sets of 2-qubit measurements , again using a scheme simplifying the initial construction [ quant - ph/0111122 ] . finally , we show how to use a single 4-qubit measurement to achieve universal quantum computation , and outline a proof for the universality of almost all maximally entangling 4-qubit measurements .
