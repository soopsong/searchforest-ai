we demonstrate an experiment which utilizes a sagnac interferometer to measure a change in optical frequency of 129 khz per root hz with only 2 mw of continuous wave , single mode input power . we describe the measurement of a weak value and show how even higher frequency sensitivities may be obtained over a bandwidth of several nanometers . this technique has many possible applications , such as precision relative frequency measurements and laser locking without the use of atomic lines .
