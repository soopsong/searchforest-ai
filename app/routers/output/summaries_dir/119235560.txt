we characterise the performance of a surface - electrode ion"chip"trap fabricated using established semiconductor integrated circuit and micro - electro - mechanical - system ( mems ) microfabrication processes which are in principle scalable to much larger ion trap arrays , as proposed for implementing ion trap quantum information processing . we measure rf ion micromotion parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the trap electrodes , and find that on - package capacitors reduce this to<~ 10 nm in amplitude . we also measure ion trapping lifetime , charging effects due to laser light incident on the trap electrodes , and the heating rate for a single trapped ion . the performance of this trap is found to be comparable with others of the same size scale .
