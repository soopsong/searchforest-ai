we analyze the no - cloning theorem in quantum mechanics through the lens of the proposed er = epr ( einstein - rosen = einstein - podolsky - rosen ) duality between entanglement and wormholes . in particular , we find that the no - cloning theorem is dual on the gravity side to the no - go theorem for topology change , violating the axioms of which allows for wormhole stabilization and causality violation . such a duality between important no - go theorems elucidates the proposed connection between spacetime geometry and quantum entanglement .
