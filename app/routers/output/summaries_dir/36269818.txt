we show that bipartite quantum states of any dimension , which do not have a positive partial transpose ( nppt ) , become 1-distillable when one adds an infinitesimal amount of bound entanglement . to this end we investigate the activation properties of a new class of symmetric bound entangled states of full rank . it is shown that in this set there exist universal activator states capable of activating the distillation of any nppt state . the result shows that even a small amount of bound entanglement can be useful for quantum information purposes .
