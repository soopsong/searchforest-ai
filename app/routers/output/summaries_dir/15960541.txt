measurements continuous in time were consistently introduced in quantum mechanics and applications worked out , mainly in quantum optics . in this context a quantum filtering theory has been developed giving the reduced state after the measurement when a certain trajectory of the measured observables is registered ( the a posteriori states ) . in this paper a new derivation of filtering equations is presented , in the cases of counting processes and of measurement processes of diffusive type . it is also shown that the equation for the a posteriori dynamics in the diffusive case can be obtained , by a suitable limit , from that one in the counting case . moreover , the paper is intended to clarify the meaning of the various concepts involved and to discuss the connections among them . as an illustration of the theory , simple models are worked out .
