we propose a scheme for the conditional generation of arbitrary finite superpositions of ( squeezed ) fock states in a single mode of a traveling optical field . the suggested setup requires only a source of squeezed states , beam splitters , strong coherent beams , and photodetectors with single - photon sensitivity . the method does not require photodetectors with a high efficiency nor with a single - photon resolution .
