we consider theoretically a superconducting qubit - nanomechanical resonator ( nr ) system , which was realized by lahaye et al . [ nature 459 , 960 ( 2009 ) ] . first , we study the problem where the state of the strongly driven qubit is probed through the frequency shift of the low - frequency nr . in the case where the coupling is capacitive , the measured quantity can be related to the so - called quantum capacitance . our theoretical results agree with the experimentally observed result that , under resonant driving , the frequency shift repeatedly changes sign . we then formulate and solve the inverse landau - zener - stuckelberg problem , where we assume the driven qubit 's state to be known ( i.e. measured by some other device ) and aim to find the parameters of the qubit 's hamiltonian . in particular , for our system the qubit 's bias is defined by the nr 's displacement . this may provide a tool for monitoring of the nr 's position .
