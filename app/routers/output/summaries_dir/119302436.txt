we present a unified treatment of sequential measurements of two conjugate observables . our approach is to derive a mathematical structure theorem for all the relevant covariant instruments . as a consequence of this result , we show that every weyl - heisenberg covariant observable can be implemented as a sequential measurement of two conjugate observables . this method is applicable both in finite and infinite dimensional hilbert spaces , therefore covering sequential spin component measurements as well as position - momentum sequential measurements .
