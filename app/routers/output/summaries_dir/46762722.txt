spatial adiabatic passage represents a new way to design integrated photonic devices . in conventional adiabatic passage designs require smoothly varying waveguide separations . here we show modelling of adiabatic passage devices where the waveguide separation is varied digitally . despite digitisation , our designs show robustness against variations in the input wavelength and refractive index contrast of the waveguides relative to the cladding . this approach to spatial adiabatic passage opens new design strategies and hence the potential for new photonics devices .
