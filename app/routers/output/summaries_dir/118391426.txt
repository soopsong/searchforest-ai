we derive a quantum master equation which describes the dynamics of the ensemble - averaged state of homogeneous disorder models at short times , and mediates a transition from coherent superpositions into classical mixtures . while each single realization follows unitary dynamics , this decoherencelike behavior arises as a consequence of the ensemble average . the master equation manifestly reflects the translational invariance of the disorder correlations and allows us to relate the disorder - induced dynamics to a collisional decoherence process , where the disorder correlations determine the spatial decay of coherences . we apply our theory to the ( one - dimensional ) anderson model .
