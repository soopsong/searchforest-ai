homomorphic encryption is an encryption scheme that allows computations to be evaluated on encrypted inputs without knowledge of their raw messages . recently ouyang et al . constructed a quantum homomorphic encryption ( qhe ) scheme for clifford circuits with statistical security ( or information - theoretic security ( it - security ) ) . it is desired to see whether an information - theoretically - secure ( its ) quantum fhe exists . if not , what other nontrivial class of quantum circuits can be homomorphically evaluated with it - security ? we provide a limitation for the first question that an its quantum fhe necessarily incurs exponential overhead . as for the second one , we propose a qhe scheme for the instantaneous quantum polynomial - time ( iqp ) circuits . our qhe scheme for iqp circuits follows from the one - time pad .
