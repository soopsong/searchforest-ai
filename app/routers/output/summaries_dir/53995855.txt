in the usual optomechanical systems , the stability of the systems severely limits those researches of the macroscopic quantum effects . we study an usual cavity optomechanical system where the frequency of the optical mode is shaken periodically . we find that , when the optical shaking frequency is large enough , the shake of the optical mode can stabilize the system . that means we can study the macroscopic quantum effects of the mechanical resonator even in the strong coupling region where the standard optomechanical systems are always unstable . as examples , we study the ground - state cooling of the mechanical resonator and the entanglement between the optical and mechanical modes in the conventional unstable region , and the results indicate that the final mean phonon number and entanglement not only can be achieved but also can be modulated by the optical shaking parameters . our proposal provides a method to study the macroscopic quantum effects even in conventional unstable region .
