quantum information processing is likely to have far - reaching impact in the field of artificial intelligence . while the race to build an error - corrected quantum computer is ongoing , noisy , intermediate - scale quantum ( nisq ) devices provide an immediate platform for exploring a possible quantum advantage through hybrid quantum -- classical machine learning algorithms . one example of such a hybrid algorithm is"quantum kitchen sinks " , which builds upon the classical algorithm known as"random kitchen sinks"to leverage a gate model quantum computer for machine learning applications . we propose an alternative algorithm called"adiabatic quantum kitchen sinks " , which employs an adiabatic quantum device to transform data features into new features in a non - linear manner , which can then be employed by classical machine learning algorithms . we present the effectiveness of our algorithm for performing binary classification on both a synthetic dataset and a real - world dataset . in terms of classification accuracy , our algorithm significantly enhances the performance of a classical linear classifier on the studied binary classification tasks and can potentially be implemented on a current adiabatic quantum device to solve practical problems .
