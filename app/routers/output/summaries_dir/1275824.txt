the electron spin is a natural two level system that allows a qubit to be encoded . when localized in a gate defined quantum dot , the electron spin provides a promising platform for a future functional quantum computer . the essential ingredient of any quantum computer is entanglement --- between electron spin qubits --- commonly achieved via the exchange interaction . nevertheless , there is an immense challenge as to how to scale the system up to include many qubits . here we propose a novel architecture of a large scale quantum computer based on a realization of long - distance quantum gates between electron spins localized in quantum dots . the crucial ingredients of such a long - distance coupling are floating metallic gates that mediate electrostatic coupling over large distances . we show , both analytically and numerically , that distant electron spins in an array of quantum dots can be coupled selectively , with coupling strengths that are larger than the electron spin decay and with switching times on the order of nanoseconds .
