using a corner transfer matrix approach , we compute the bipartite entanglement r\'enyi entropy in the off - critical perturbations of non - unitary conformal minimal models realised by lattice spin chains hamiltonians related to the forrester baxter rsos models in regime iii . this allows to show on a set of explicit examples that the r\'enyi entropies for non - unitary theories rescale near criticality as the logarithm of the correlation length with a coefficient proportional to the effective central charge . this complements a similar result , recently established for the size rescaling at the critical point , showing the expected agreement of the two behaviours . we also compute the first subleading unusual correction to the scaling behaviour , showing that it is expressible in terms of expansions of various fractional powers of the correlation length , related to the differences $ \delta-\delta_{\min}$ between the conformal dimensions of fields in the theory and the minimal conformal dimension . finally , a few observations on the limit leading to the off - critical logarithmic minimal models of pearce and seaton are put forward .
