a novel quantum pattern recognition scheme is presented , which combines the idea of a classic hopfield neural network with adiabatic quantum computation . both the input and the memorized patterns are represented by means of the problem hamiltonian . in contrast to classic neural networks , the algorithm can return a quantum superposition of multiple recognized patterns . a proof of principle for the algorithm for two qubits is provided using a liquid state nmr quantum computer .
