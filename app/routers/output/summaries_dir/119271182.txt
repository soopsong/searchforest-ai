we investigate the question of whether the entropy and the renyi entropies of the vacuum state reduced to a region of the space can be represented in terms of correlators in quantum field theory . in this case , the positivity relations for the correlators are mapped into inequalities for the entropies . we write them using a real time version of reflection positivity , which can be generalized to general quantum systems . using this generalization we can prove an infinite sequence of inequalities which are obeyed by the renyi entropies of integer index . there is one independent inequality involving any number of different subsystems . in quantum field theory the inequalities acquire a simple geometrical form and are consistent with the integer index renyi entropies being given by vacuum expectation values of twisting operators in the euclidean formulation . several possible generalizations and specific examples are analyzed .
