the cahill - glauber approach for quantum mechanics on phase - space is extended to the finite dimensional case through the use of discrete coherent states . all properties and features of the continuous formalism are appropriately generalized . the continuum results are promptly recovered as a limiting case . the jacobi theta functions are shown to have a prominent role in the context .
