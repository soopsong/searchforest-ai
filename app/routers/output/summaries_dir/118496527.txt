we propose a feedback control scheme for generating and stabilizing pure states of transport devices , such as charge qubits , under non - equilibrium conditions . the purification of the device state is conditioned on single electron jumps and leaves a clear signal in the full counting statistics which can be used to optimize control parameters . as an example of our control scheme , we are presenting the stabilization pure transport states in a double quantum dot setup with the inclusion of phonon dephasing .
