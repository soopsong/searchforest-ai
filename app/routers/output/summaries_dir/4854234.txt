in this article we use geometric optimal control to completely solve the problem of minimum - time transitions between thermal equilibrium and fixed average energy states of the quantum parametric oscillator , a system which has been extensively used to model quantum heat engines and refrigerators . we subsequently use the obtained results to find the minimum driving time for a quantum refrigerator and the quantum finite - time availability of the parametric oscillator , i.e. the potential work which can be extracted from this system by a very short finite - time process .
