using the trotter - kato theorem we prove the convergence of the unitary dynamics generated by an increasingly singular hamiltonian in the case of a single field coupling . the limit dynamics is a quantum stochastic evolution of hudson - parthasarathy type , and we establish in the process a graph limit convergence of the pre - limit hamiltonian operators to the chebotarev - gregoratti - von waldenfels hamiltonian generating the quantum ito evolution .
