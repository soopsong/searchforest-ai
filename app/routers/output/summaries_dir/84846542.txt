we show that naturally associated to a sic ( symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measure or sic - povm ) in dimension d there are a number of higher dimensional structures : specifically a projector and a complex hadamard matrix in dimension d squared and a pair of etfs ( equiangular tight frames ) in dimensions d(d-1)/2 , d(d+1)/2 . we also show that a wh ( weyl heisenberg covariant ) sic in odd dimension d is naturally associated to a pair of symmetric tight fusion frames in dimension d. we deduce two relaxations of the wh sic existence problem . we also find a reformulation of the problem in which the number of equations is fewer than the number of variables . finally , we show that in at least four cases the structures associated to a sic lie on continuous manifolds of such structures . in two of these cases the manifolds are non - linear . restricted defect calculations are consistent with this being true for the structures associated to every known sic with d between 3 and 16 , suggesting it may be true for all d greater than 2 .
