previously we have investigated the thermodynamical properties of d - brane -- anti - d - brane pairs by calculating the one - loop free energy and the finite temperature effective action in the framework of matsubara formalism . this calculation is based on boundary string field theory , and we have a problem of a choice of weyl factors on the two boundaries of one - loop open string world - sheet . we have chosen one of them and compute the one - loop free energy . in this paper , we derive the mass spectrum of open strings on a d - brane -- anti - d - brane pair supposing that the world - sheet is a strip , and compute the thermal vacuum state , free energy and the partition function for a single open string in the framework of thermo field dynamics . from this we can reproduce the free energy for multiple strings in the case of matsubara method . this fact reinforces our argument of the choice of the weyl factors in the case of matsubara formalism .
