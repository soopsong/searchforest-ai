we theoretically investigate the stability of a two cascaded cavity optomechanical system with optical parametric amplifiers ( opas ) inside the two coupled cavities , and study the steady - state entanglement between two distant mechanical resonators . we show that the parameter regime where the system is unstable without opas , such as relatively high laser intensity and blue detuning , can be exploited to build the steady - state mechanical entanglement by modulating the parametric gain . the application of opas is helpful to preserve the mechanical entanglement suffered from the dissipation at some finite temperature . the scheme provides an alternative way for improving and engineering the quantum entanglement of two distant mechanical oscillators .
