we report the generation of squeezed vacuum states of light at 1550 nm with a broadband quantum noise reduction of up to 4.8 db ranging from 5 mhz to 1.2 ghz sideband frequency . we used a custom - designed 2.6 mm long biconvex periodically - poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ppktp ) crystal . it featured reflectively coated end surfaces , 2.26 ghz of linewidth and generated the squeezing via optical parametric amplification . two homodyne detectors with different quantum efficiencies and bandwidths were used to characterize the non - classical noise suppression . we measured squeezing values of up to 4.8 db from 5 to 100 mhz and up to 3 db from 100 mhz to 1.2 ghz . the squeezed vacuum measurements were limited by detection loss . we propose an improved detection scheme to measure up to 10 db squeezing over 1 ghz . our results of ghz bandwidth squeezed light generation provide new prospects for high - speed quantum key distribution .
