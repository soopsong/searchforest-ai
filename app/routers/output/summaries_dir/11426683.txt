the main result in this paper is a one term szego type asymptotic formula with a sharp remainder estimate for a class of integral operators of the pseudodifferential type with symbols which are allowed to be non - smooth or discontinuous in both position and momentum . the simplest example of such symbol is the product of the characteristic functions of two compact sets , one in real space and the other in momentum space . the results of this paper are used in a study of the violation of the area entropy law for free fermions in [ 18 ] . this work also provides evidence towards a conjecture due to harold widom .
