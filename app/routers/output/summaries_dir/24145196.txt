in this paper , we study grover walks on a line with one and two absorbing boundaries . in particular , we present some results for the absorbing probabilities both in a semi - finite and finite line . analytical expressions for these absorbing probabilities are presented by using the combinatorial approach . these results are perfectly matched with numerical simulations . we show that the behavior of grover walks on a line with absorbing boundaries is strikingly different from that of classical walks and that of hadamard walks .
