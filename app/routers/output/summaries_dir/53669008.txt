measurement outcomes of a quantum state can be genuinely random ( unpredictable ) according to the basic laws of quantum mechanics . the heisenberg - robertson uncertainty relation puts constrains on the accuracy of two noncommuting observables . the existing uncertainty relations adopt variance or entropic measures , which are functions of observed outcome distributions , to quantify the uncertainty . according to recent studies of quantum coherence , such uncertainty measures contain both classical ( predictable ) and quantum ( unpredictable ) components . in order to extract out the quantum effects , we define quantum uncertainty to be the coherence of the state on the measurement basis . we discover a quantum uncertainty relation of coherence between two measurement non - commuting bases . furthermore , we analytically derive the quantum uncertainty relation for the qubit case with three widely adopted coherence measures , the relative entropy using coherence , the coherence of formation , and the $ l_1 $ norm of coherence .
