we report on the demonstration of broadband squeezed laser beams that show a frequency dependent orientation of the squeezing ellipse . carrier frequency as well as quadrature angle were stably locked to a reference laser beam at 1064 nm . this frequency dependent squeezing was characterized in terms of noise power spectra and contour plots of wigner functions . the later were measured by quantum state tomography . our tomograph allowed a stable lock to a local oscillator beam for arbitrary quadrature angles with one degree precision . frequency dependent orientations of the squeezing ellipse are necessary for squeezed states of light to provide a broadband sensitivity improvement in third generation gravitational wave interferometers . we consider the application of our system to long baseline interferometers such as a future squeezed light upgraded geo600 detector .
