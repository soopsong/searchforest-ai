the aim of this article is to study the effect of an event horizon on the entanglement of the quantum vacuum and how entanglement , together with the holographic principle , may explain the current value of the cosmological constant , in light of recent theories . entanglement is tested for vacuum states very near and very far from the horizon of a de sitter universe , using the peres - horodecki ( ppt ) criterion . a scalar vacuum field ( $ \hat{\phi}$ ) is averaged inside two boxes of volume $ v$ in different spatial positions such that it acquires the structure of a bipartite quantum harmonic oscillator , for which the ppt criterion is a necessary but not sufficient condition of separability . entanglement is found between states obtained from boxes shaped as spherical shells with thickness of the order of one planck distance ( $ l_p$ ) , when one of the states is near the horizon , and the other state is anywhere in the universe . entanglement disappears when the distance of the state near the horizon and the horizon increases to around $ 5l_p$. if we consider the horizon not as a surface but as a spherical shell of thickness $ l_p$ , then this means that there is entanglement between the states in the horizon and the rest of the universe . when both states are at distances larger than $ \sim 5 l_p$ from the horizon , no entanglement is found .
