recently , an explicit relation between a measure of entanglement and a geometric entity has been reported in quantum inf . process . ( 2016 ) 15:1629 - 1638 . it has been shown that if a qubit gets entangled with another ancillary qubit then negativity , up to a constant factor , is equal to square root of a specific riemannian metric defined on the metric space corresponding to the state space of the qubit . in this article , we consider the different class of bi - partite entangled states and show explicit relation between two measures of entanglement and riemannian metric .
