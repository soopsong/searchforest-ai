we study the entanglement generated between dirac modes in a 2-dimensional conformally flat robertson - walker universe . we find radical qualitative differences between the bosonic and fermionic entanglement generated by the expansion . the particular way in which fermionic fields get entangled encodes more information about the underlying space - time than the bosonic case , thereby allowing us to reconstruct the parameters of the history of the expansion . this highlights the importance of bosonic / fermionic statistics to account for relativistic effects on the entanglement of quantum fields .
