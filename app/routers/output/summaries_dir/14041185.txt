we prove an uncertainty relation , which imposes a bound on any joint measurement of position and momentum . it is of the form $ ( \delta p)(\delta q)\geq c\hbar$ , where the ` uncertainties ' quantify the difference between the marginals of the joint measurement and the corresponding ideal observable . applied to an approximate position measurement followed by a momentum measurement , the uncertainties become the precision $ \delta q$ of the position measurement , and the perturbation $ \delta p$ of the conjugate variable introduced by such a measurement . we also determine the best constant $ c$ , which is attained for a unique phase space covariant measurement .
