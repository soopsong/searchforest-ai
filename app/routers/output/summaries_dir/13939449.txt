one of the strengths of quantum information theory is that it can treat quantum states without referring to their particular physical representation . in principle , quantum states can be therefore fully swapped between various quantum systems by their mutual interaction and this quantum state transfer is crucial for many quantum communication and information processing tasks . in practice , however , the achievable interaction time and strength are often limited by decoherence . here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a procedure for faithful quantum state transfer between two weakly interacting qubits . our scheme enables a probabilistic yet perfect unidirectional transfer of an arbitrary unknown state of a source qubit onto a target qubit prepared initially in a known state . the transfer is achieved by a combination of a suitable measurement of the source qubit and quantum filtering on the target qubit depending on the outcome of measurement on the source qubit . we experimentally verify feasibility and robustness of the transfer using a linear optical setup with qubits encoded into polarization states of single photons .
