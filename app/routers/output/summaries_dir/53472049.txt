two - dimensional electronic spectroscopy has become one of the main experimental tools for analyzing the dynamics of excitonic energy transfer in large molecular complexes . simplified theoretical models are usually employed to extract model parameters from the experimental spectral data . here we show that computationally expensive but exact theoretical methods encoded into a neural network can be used to extract model parameters and infer structural information such as dipole orientation from two dimensional electronic spectra ( 2des ) or reversely , to produce 2des from model parameters . we propose to use machine learning as a tool to predict unknown parameters in the models underlying recorded spectra and as a way to encode computationally expensive numerical methods into efficient prediction tools . we showcase the use of a trained neural network to efficiently compute disordered averaged spectra and demonstrate that disorder averaging has non - trivial effects for polarization controlled 2des .
