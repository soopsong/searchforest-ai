strongly squeezed light finds many important applications within the fields of quantum metrology , quantum communication and quantum computation . however , due to the bulkiness and complexity of most squeezed light sources of today , they are still not a standard tool in quantum optics labs . we have taken the first steps in realizing a compact , high - performance 1550 nm squeezing source based on commercially available fiber components combined with a free - space double - resonant parametric down - conversion source . the whole setup , including single - pass second - harmonic generation in a waveguide , fits on a small breadboard and produces 9.3 db of squeezing at a 5 mhz sideband - frequency . the setup is currently limited by phase noise , but further optimization and development should allow for a 19"sized turn - key squeezing source capable of delivering more than 10 db of squeezing .
