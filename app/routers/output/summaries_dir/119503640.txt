utilizing the highly correlated quantum noon states of particles , we have implemented a proof - of - principle quantum thermometer using the nmr technique for measuring the variation of local magnetic field with the temperature variation . the system used was the star - topology system of hexafluorophosphate molecules and the thermometer showed a sensitivity of $ 85nt/ ^o c$. using the hexafluorophosphate and the trimethylphosphite spin systems , we have quantified the advantage of the quantum protocol over the classical one for measuring magnetic field . the quantum protocol showed the best performance for a time evolution in the quantum circuit of $ t = 20ms$ , where the errors in the measurement scaled as the heisenberg limit $ 1 / n$.
