providing the microscopic behavior of a thermalization process has always been an intriguing issue . there are several models of thermalization , which often requires interaction of the system under consideration with the microscopic constituents of the macroscopic heat bath . with an aim to simulate such a thermalization process , here we look at the thermalization of a two - level quantum system under the action of a markovian master equation corresponding to memory - less action of a heat bath , kept at a certain temperature , using a single - qubit ancilla . a two - qubit interaction hamiltonian ( $ h_{th}$ , say ) is then designed -- with a single - qubit thermal state as the initial state of the ancilla -- which gives rise to thermalization of the system qubit in the infinite time limit . further , we study the general form of hamiltonian , of which ours is a special case , and look for the conditions for thermalization to occur . we also derive a lindblad - like non - markovian master equation for the system dynamics under the general form of system - ancilla hamiltonian .
