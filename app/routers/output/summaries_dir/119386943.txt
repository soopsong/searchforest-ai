practically applicable criteria for the nonclassicality of quantum states are formulated in terms of different types of moments . for this purpose the moments of the creation and annihilation operators , of two quadratures , and of a quadrature and the photon number operator turn out to be useful . it is shown that all the required moments can be determined by homodyne correlation measurements . an example of a nonclassical effect that is easily characterized by our methods is amplitude - squared squeezing .
