we compute rigorously the ground and equilibrium states for kitaev 's model in 2d , both the finite and infinite version , using an analogy with the 1d ising ferromagnet . next , we investigate the structure of the reduced dynamics in the presence of thermal baths in the markovian regime . special attention is paid to the dynamics of the topological freedoms which have been proposed for storing quantum information .
