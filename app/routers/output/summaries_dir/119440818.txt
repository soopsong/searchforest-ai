we propose the schemes of quantum secure direct communication ( qsdc ) based on secret transmitting order of particles . in these protocols , the secret transmitting order of particles ensures the security of communication , and no secret messages are leaked even if the communication is interrupted for security . this strategy of security for communication is also generalized to quantum dialogue . it not only ensures the unconditional security but also improves the efficiency of communication .
