inspired by the possibility that generative models based on quantum circuits can provide a useful inductive bias for sequence modeling tasks , we propose an efficient training algorithm for a subset of classically simulable quantum circuit models . the gradient - free algorithm , presented as a sequence of exactly solvable effective models , is a modification of the density matrix renormalization group procedure adapted for learning a probability distribution . the conclusion that circuit - based models offer a useful inductive bias for classical datasets is supported by experimental results on the parity learning problem .
