we address the generation of fully inseparable three - mode entangled states of radiation by interlinked nonlinear interactions in $ \chi^{(2)}$ media . we show how three - mode entanglement can be used to realize symmetric and asymmetric telecloning machines , which achieve optimal fidelity for coherent states . an experimental implementation involving a single nonlinear crystal where the two interactions take place simultaneously is suggested . preliminary experimental results showing the feasibility and the effectiveness of the interaction scheme with seeded crystal are also presented .
