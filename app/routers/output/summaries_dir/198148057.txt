spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) has been a key enabling technology in exploring quantum phenomena and their applications for decades . for instance , traditional spdc , which splits a high energy pump photon into two lower energy photons , is a common way to produce entangled photon pairs . since the early realizations of spdc , researchers have thought to generalize it to higher order , e.g. , to produce entangled photon triplets . however , directly generating photon triplets through a single spdc process has remained elusive . here , using a flux - pumped superconducting parametric cavity , we demonstrate direct three - photon spdc , with photon triplets generated in a single cavity mode or split between multiple modes . with strong pumping , the states can be quite bright , with flux densities exceeding 60 photon / s / hz . the observed states are strongly non - gaussian , which has important implications for potential applications . in the single - mode case , we observe a triangular star - shaped distribution of quadrature voltages , indicative of the long - predicted"star state " . the observed star state shows strong third - order correlations , as expected for a state generated by a cubic hamiltonian . by pumping at the sum frequency of multiple modes , we observe strong three - body correlations between multiple modes , strikingly , in the absence of second - order correlations . we further analyze the third - order correlations under mode transformations by the symplectic symmetry group , showing that the observed transformation properties serve to"fingerprint"the specific cubic hamiltonian that generates them . the observed non - gaussian , third - order correlations represent an important step forward in quantum optics and may have a strong impact on quantum communication with microwave fields as well as continuous - variable quantum computation .
