in this paper we propose a continuous - time , dissipative markov dynamics that asymptotically drives a network of n - dimensional quantum systems to the set of states that are invariant under the action of the subsystem permutation group . the lindblad - type generator of the dynamics is built with two - body subsystem swap operators , thus satisfying locality constraints , and preserve symmetric observables . the potential use of the proposed generator in combination with local control and measurement actions is illustrated with two applications : the generation of a global pure state and the estimation of the network size .
