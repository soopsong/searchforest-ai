mutually unbiased bases which is also maximally entangled bases is called mutually unbiased maximally entangled bases ( mumebs ) . we study the construction of mumebs in bipartite system . in detail , we construct 2(p^a-1 ) mumebs in c^d\otimes c^d by properties of guss sums for arbitrary odd d. it improves the known lower bound p^a-1 for odd d. certainly , it also generalizes the lower bound 2(p^a-1 ) for d being a single prime power . furthermore , we construct mumebs in c^d\otimes c^{kd } for general k>= 2 and odd d. we get the similar lower bounds as $ k , b$ are both single prime powers . particularly , when k is a square number , by using mutually orthogonal latin squares , we can construct more mumebs in c^d\otimes c^{kd } , and obtain greater lower bounds than reducing the problem into prime power dimension in some cases .
