in this paper , we follow our presented model in j. opt . soc . am . b { \bf 30 } , 1109 - -1117 ( 2013 ) , in which the interaction between a $ \lambda$-type three - level atom and a quantized two - mode radiation field in a cavity in the presence of nonlinearities is studied . after giving a brief review on the procedure of obtaining the state vector of the atom - field system , some further interesting and important physical features ( which are of particular interest in the quantum optics field of research ) of the whole system state , i.e. , the number - phase entropic uncertainty relation ( based on the two - mode pegg - barnett formalism ) and some of the nonclassicality signs consist of sub - poissonian statistics , cauchy - schwartz inequality and two kinds of squeezing phenomenon are investigated . during our presentation , the effects of intensity - dependent coupling , deformed kerr medium and the detuning parameters on the depth and domain of each of the mentioned nonclassical criteria of the considered quantum system are studied , in detail . it is shown that each of the mentioned nonclassicality aspects can be obtained by appropriately choosing the related parameters .
