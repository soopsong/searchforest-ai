we consider a model of computation motivated by possible limitations on quantum computers . we have a linear array of n wires , and we may perform operations only on pairs of adjacent wires . our goal is to build a circuits that perform specified operations spanning all n wires . we show that the natural lower bound of n-1 on circuit depth is nearly tight for a variety of problems , and we prove linear upper bounds for additional problems . in particular , using only gates adding a wire ( mod 2 ) into an adjacent wire , we can realize any linear operation in gl_n(2 ) as a circuit of depth 5n . we show that some linear operations require depth at least 2n+1 .
