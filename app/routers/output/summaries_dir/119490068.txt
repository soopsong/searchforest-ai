we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the separability of tripartite three mode gaussian states , that is easy to check for any such state . we give a classification of the separability properties of those systems and show how to determine for any state to which class it belongs . we show that there exist genuinely tripartite bound entangled states and point out how to construct and prepare such states .
