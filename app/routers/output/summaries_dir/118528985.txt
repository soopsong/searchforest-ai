we report on our research effort to generate large - scale multipartite optical - mode entanglement using as few physical resources as possible . we have previously shown that cluster- and ghz - type n - partite continuous - variable entanglement can be obtained in an optical resonator that contains a suitably designed second - order nonlinear optical medium , pumped by at most o(n^2 ) fields . in this paper , we show that the frequency comb of such a resonator can be entangled into an arbitrary number of independent 2x2 and 2x3 continuous - variable cluster states by a single optical parametric oscillator pumped by just a few optical modes .
