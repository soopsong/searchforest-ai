we report on the production of ultracold heteronuclear ybli * molecules in a dual - species magneto - optical trap by photoassociation ( pa ) . the formation of the electronically excited molecules close to dissociation was observed by trap loss spectroscopy . we find 4 rovibrational states within a range of $ 250\,$ghz below the yb($^1s_0 $ ) + li($^2p_{1/2}$ ) asymptote and observe isotopic pa line shifts in mixtures of $ ^6$li with $ ^{174}$yb , $ ^{172}$yb , and $ ^{176}$yb . we also describe our theoretical ab - initio calculation for the relevant electronic potentials and utilize it to analyze and identify the lines in the experimentally observed spectrum .
