the ability to engineer the quantum state of traveling optical fields is a central requirement for quantum information science and technology , including quantum communication , computing and metrology . in this video article , we describe the reliable generation of non - gaussian states , including single - photon states and coherent state superpositions , using a conditional preparation method operated on the non - classical light emitted by optical parametric oscillators . type - i and type - ii phase - matched opos operated below threshold , i.e. single - mode or two - mode squeezed vacuum sources , are considered and common procedures , such as the required frequency filtering or the high - efficiency quantum state characterization by homodyning , are detailed . the reported method enables a high fidelity with the targeted state and the generation of the state in a well - controlled spatiotemporal mode , a crucial feature for their use in subsequent protocols .
