we consider an optomechanical quantum system composed of a single cavity mode interacting with n mechanical resonators . we propose a scheme for generating continuous - variable graph states of arbitrary size and shape , including the so - called cluster states for universal quantum computation . the main feature of this scheme is that , differently from previous approaches , the graph states are hosted in the mechanical degrees of freedom rather than in the radiative ones . specifically , via a 2n - tone laser drive , we engineer a linear hamiltonian which is instrumental to dissipatively drive the system to the desired target state . the robustness of this scheme is assessed against finite interaction times and mechanical noise , confirming it as a valuable approach towards quantum state engineering for continuous - variable computation in a solid - state platform .
