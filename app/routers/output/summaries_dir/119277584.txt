continuous - time quantum walks are natural tools for spatial search , where one searches for a marked vertex in a graph . sometimes , the structure of the graph causes the walker to get trapped , such that the probability of finding the marked vertex is limited . we give an example with two linked cliques , proving that the captive probability can be liberated by increasing the weights of the links . this allows the search to succeed with probability 1 without increasing the energy scaling of the algorithm . further increasing the weights , however , slows the runtime , so the optimal search requires weights that are neither too weak nor too strong .
