quantum interfaces between polarized atomic ensembles and coherent states of light , applied recently to manipulate bipartite and multipartite entanglement , are revisited by means of a continuous - variable formalism . the explicit use of the continuous - variable formalism facilitates significantly the analysis of entanglement between different modes , reducing it to the study of the properties of a final covariance matrix which can be found analytically . furthermore , it allows to study matter - light interfaces for mixed states , adapting the formalism to the experimental situations in which the initial prepared gaussian states are , unavoidably , affected by a certain amount of noise . a multipartite scenario , leading to the generation of macroscopic cluster states is presented and analyzed in detail within this formalism .
