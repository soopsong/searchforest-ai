we introduce a quantum - optical notion of nonclassicality that we call as the process output nonclassicality for multimode quantum channels . the motivation comes from an information - theoretic point of view and the emphasis is on the output states of a channel . we deem a channel to be ` classical ' if its outputs are always classical irrespective of the input , i.e. , if the channel is nonclassicality breaking , and nonclassical otherwise . our condition is stronger than the one considered by rahimi - keshari et al . [ prl { \bf 110 } , 160401 ( 2013 ) ] and we compare the two approaches . using our framework we then quantify the nonclassicality of a quantum process by introducing a noise - robustness type of measure that we call as the nonclassicality depth of a channel . it characterizes a certain threshold noise beyond which a given channel outputs only classical states . we achieve this by generalizing a prescription by lee [ pra { \bf 44 } , r2775 ( 1991 ) ] to multimode states and then by extension to multimode channels .
