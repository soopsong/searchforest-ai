we study entanglement generation and control in bi - directional waveguide qed driven by a two photon gaussian wavepacket . in particular , we focus on how increasing the number of qubits affects the overall average pairwise entanglement in the system . we also investigate how the presence of a second photon can introduce non - linearities , thereby manipulating the generated entanglement . in addition , we show that through the introduction of chirality and small decay rates , entanglement can be stored and enhanced up to factors of 2 and 3 , respectively . finally , we analyze the influence of finite detunnings and time - delays on the generated entanglement .
