we develop an instantonic calculus to derive an analytical expression for the thermally - assisted tunneling decay rate of a metastable state in a fully connected quantum spin model . the tunneling decay problem can be mapped onto the kramers escape problem of a classical random dynamical field . this dynamical field is simulated efficiently by path integral quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) . we show analytically that the exponential scaling with the number of spins of the thermally - assisted quantum tunneling rate and the escape rate of the qmc process are identical . we relate this effect to the existence of a dominant instantonic tunneling path . the instanton trajectory is described by nonlinear dynamical mean - field theory equations for a single site magnetization vector , which we solve exactly . finally , we derive scaling relations for the"spiky"barrier shape when the spin tunnelling and qmc rates scale polynomially with the number of spins $ n$ while a purely classical over - the - barrier activation rate scales exponentially with $ n$.
