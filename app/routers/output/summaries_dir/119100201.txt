we present an analysis of the cooling of a micro - mechanical resonator by means of measurements and back action . the measurements are performed via the coupling to a cooper - pair box , and although the coupling does not lead to net cooling , the extraction of information and hence entropy from the system leads to a pure quantum state . under suitable circumstances , the states become very close to coherent states , conditioned on the measurement record , and can hence be displaced to the oscillator ground state .
