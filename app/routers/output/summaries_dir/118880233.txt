a scheme for distributed quantum measurement that allows nondestructive or indirect bell measurement was proposed by gupta et al . , ( int . j. quant . infor . \textbf{5 } ( 2007 ) 627 ) and subsequently realized experimentally using an nmr - based three - qubit quantum computer by samal et al . , ( j. phys . b , \textbf{43 } ( 2010 ) 095508 ) . in the present work , a similar experiment is performed using the five - qubit super - conductivity - based quantum computer , which has been recently placed in cloud by ibm corporation . the experiment confirmed that the bell state can be constructed and measured in a nondestructive manner with a reasonably high fidelity . a comparison of the outcomes of this study and the results obtained earlier in the nmr - based experiment has also been performed . the study indicates that to make a scalable squid - based computer , errors by the gates ( in the present technology ) have to be reduced considerably .
