we study the deformation of the horizon - vicinity geometry caused by quantum gravitational effects . departure from the semi - classical picture is noted , and the fact that the matter part of the action comes at a higher order in newton 's constant than does the einstein - hilbert term is crucial for the departure . the analysis leads to a firewall - type energy measured by an infalling observer for which quantum generation of the cosmological constant is critical . the analysis seems to suggest that the firewall should be a part of such deformation and that the information be stored both in the horizon - vicinity and asymptotic boundary region . we also examine the behavior near the cosmological horizon .
