the decomposition of matrices associated to two - qubit and three - qubit orthogonal gates is studied , and based on the decomposition the synthesis of these gates is investigated . the optimal synthesis of general two - qubit orthogonal gate is obtained . for two - qubit unimodular orthogonal gate , it requires at most 2 cnot gates and 6 one - qubit ry gates . for the general three - qubit unimodular orthogonal gate , it can be synthesized by 16 cnot gates and 36 one - qubit ry and rz gates in the worst case .
