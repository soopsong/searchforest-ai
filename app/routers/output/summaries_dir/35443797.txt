we present a concept for performing direct parity measurements on three or more qubits in microwave structures with superconducting resonators coupled to josephson - junction qubits . we write the quantum - eraser conditions that must be fulfilled for the parity measurements as requirements for the scattering phase shift of our microwave structure . we show that these conditions can be fulfilled with present - day devices . we present one particular scheme , implemented with two - dimensional cavity techniques , in which each qubit should be coupled equally to two different microwave cavities . the magnitudes of the couplings that are needed are in the range that has been achieved in current experiments . a quantum calculation indicates that the measurement is optimal if the scattering signal can be measured with near single photon sensitivity . a comparison with an extension of a related proposal from cavity optics is presented . we present a second scheme , for which a scalable implementation of the four - qubit parities of the surface quantum error correction code can be envisioned . it uses three - dimensional cavity structures , using cavity symmetries to achieve the necessary multiple resonant modes within a single resonant structure .
