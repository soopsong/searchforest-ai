we analyze continuous - time quantum walks on necklace graphs - cyclical graphs consisting of many copies of a smaller graph ( pearl ) . using a bloch - type ansatz for the eigenfunctions , we block - diagonalize the hamiltonian , reducing the effective size of the problem to the size of a single pearl . we then present a general approach for showing that the mixing time scales ( with growing size of the necklace ) similarly to that of a simple walk on a cycle . finally , we present results for mixing on several necklace graphs .
