we present and discuss perspectives of current developments on advanced quantum optical circuits monolithically integrated in the lithium niobate platform . a set of basic components comprising photon pair sources based on parametric down conversion ( pdc ) , passive routing elements and active electro - optically controllable switches and polarisation converters are building blocks of a toolbox which is the basis for a broad range of diverse quantum circuits . we review the state - of - the - art of these components and provide models that properly describe their performance in quantum circuits . as an example for applications of these models we discuss design issues for a circuit providing on - chip two - photon interference . the circuit comprises a pdc section for photon pair generation followed by an actively controllable modified mach - zehnder structure for observing hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interference . the performance of such a chip is simulated theoretically by taking even imperfections of the properties of the individual components into account .
