in recent years , deep learning has had a profound impact on machine learning and artificial intelligence . at the same time , algorithms for quantum computers have been shown to efficiently solve some problems that are intractable on conventional , classical computers . we show that quantum computing not only reduces the time required to train a deep restricted boltzmann machine , but also provides a richer and more comprehensive framework for deep learning than classical computing and leads to significant improvements in the optimization of the underlying objective function . our quantum methods also permit efficient training of full boltzmann machines and multi - layer , fully connected models and do not have well known classical counterparts .
