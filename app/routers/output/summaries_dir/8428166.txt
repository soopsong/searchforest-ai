we demonstrate that thousands of periodic nano - craters are fabricated on a subwavelength - diameter tapered optical fiber , an optical nanofiber , by irradiating with just a single femtosecond laser pulse . a key aspect of the fabrication is that the nanofiber itself acts as a cylindrical lens and focuses the femtosecond laser beam on its shadow surface . we also demonstrate that such periodic structures on the nanofiber , act as a 1-d photonic crystal ( phc ) . such phc structures on the nanofiber will strongly enhance the field confinement in such a tapered fiber - based system and may open new avenues in nanophotonics and quantum information technology .
