we introduce an electro - optic hardware platform for nonlinear activation functions in optical neural networks . the optical - to - optical nonlinearity operates by converting a small portion of the input optical signal into an analog electric signal , which is used to intensity - modulate the original optical signal with no reduction in processing speed . our scheme allows for complete nonlinear on - off contrast in transmission at relatively low optical power thresholds and eliminates the requirement of having additional optical sources between each layer of the network . moreover , the activation function is reconfigurable via electrical bias , allowing it to be programmed or trained to synthesize a variety of nonlinear responses . using numerical simulations , we demonstrate that this activation function significantly improves the expressiveness of optical neural networks , allowing them to perform well on two benchmark machine learning tasks : learning a multi - input exclusive - or ( xor ) logic function and classification of images of handwritten numbers from the mnist dataset . the addition of the nonlinear activation function improves test accuracy on the mnist task from 85 % to 94 % .
