we propose a marginally stable optical resonator suitable for atom interferometry . the resonator geometry is based on two flat mirrors at the focal planes of a lens that produces the large beam waist required to coherently manipulate cold atomic ensembles . optical gains of about 100 are achievable using optics with part - per - thousand losses . the resulting power build - up will allow for enhanced coherent manipulation of the atomic wavepackets such as large separation beamsplitters . we study the effect of longitudinal misalignments and assess the robustness of the resonator in terms of intensity and phase profiles of the intra - cavity field . we also study how to implement atom interferometry based on large momentum transfer bragg diffraction in such a cavity .
