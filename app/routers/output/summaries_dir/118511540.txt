we describe nonlinear phonon - thermoelectric devices where charge current and electronic and phononic heat currents are coupled , driven by voltage and temperature biases , when phonon - assisted inelastic processes dominate the transport . our thermoelectric transistors and rectifiers can be realized in a gate - tunable double quantum - dot system embedded in a nanowire which is realizable within current technology . the inelastic electron - phonon scattering processes are found to induce pronounced charge , heat , and cross rectification effects , as well as a thermal transistor effect that , remarkably , can appear in the present model even in the linear - response regime without relying on negative differential thermal conductance .
