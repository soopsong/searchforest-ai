the synchronization properties of two self - sustained quantum oscillators are studied in the wigner representation . instead of considering the quantum limit of the quantum van - der - pol master equation we derive the quantum master equation directly from a suitable hamiltonian . moreover , the oscillators are coupled in incorporating an additional phase factor which shows up in the mutual correlations .
