transport in nonequilibrium degenerate quantum systems is investigated . transfer rate depends on parameters of the system . in this paper we investigate dependence of the flow ( transfer rate ) on the angle between"bright"vectors ( which define interaction of the system with the environment ) . we show that in some approximation for the system under investigation the flow is proportional to cosine squared of the angle between"bright"vectors . earlier in arxiv:1603.07182 it was shown that in this degenerate quantum system excitation of non - decaying quantum"dark"states is possible , moreover the effectiveness of this process is proportional to sine squared of the angle between"bright"vectors ( this phenomenon was discussed as a possible model of excitation of quantum coherences in quantum photosynthesis ) . thus quantum transport and excitation of dark states are competing processes , dark states can be considered as a result of leakage of quantum states in quantum thermodynamic machine which performs the quantum transport .
