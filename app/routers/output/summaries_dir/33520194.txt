the internal thermal noise in ligo 's test masses is analyzed by a new technique , a direct application of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem to ligo 's readout observable , $ x(t)=$(longitudinal position of test - mass face , weighted by laser beam 's gaussian profile ) . previous analyses , which relied on a normal - mode decomposition of the test - mass motion , were valid only if the dissipation is uniformally distributed over the test - mass interior , and they converged reliably to a final answer only when the beam size was a non - negligible fraction of the test - mass cross section . this paper 's direct analysis , by contrast , can handle inhomogeneous dissipation and arbitrary beam sizes . in the domain of validity of the previous analysis , the two methods give the same answer for $ s_x(f)$ , the spectral density of thermal noise , to within expected accuracy . the new analysis predicts that thermal noise due to dissipation concentrated in the test mass 's front face ( e.g. due to mirror coating ) scales as $ 1 / r_0 ^ 2 $ , by contrast with homogeneous dissipation , which scales as $ 1 / r_0 $ ( $ r_0 $ is the beam radius ) ; so surface dissipation could become significant for small beam sizes .
