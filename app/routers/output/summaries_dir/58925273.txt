open quantum random walks , as developed in \cite{apss } , are a quantum generalization of markov chains on finite graphs or on lattices . these random walks are typically quantum in their behavior , step by step , but they seem to show up a rather classical asymptotic behavior , as opposed to the quantum random walks usually considered in quantum information theory ( such as the well - known hadamard random walk ) . typically , in the case of open quantum random walks on lattices , their distribution seems to always converge to a gaussian distribution or a mixture of gaussian distributions . in the case of nearest neighbors homogeneous open quantum random walks on $ \zz^d$ we prove such a central limit theorem , in the case where only one gaussian distribution appears in the limit . through the quantum trajectory point of view on quantum master equations , we transform the problem into studying a certain functional of a markov chain on $ \zz^d$ times the banach space of quantum states . the main difficulty is that we know nothing about the invariant measures of this markov chain , even their existence . surprisingly enough , we are able to produce a central limit theorem with explicit drift and explicit covariance matrix . the interesting point which appears with our construction and result is that it applies actually to a wider setup : it provides a central limit theorem for the sequence of recordings of the quantum trajectories associated to any completely positive map . this is what we show and develop as an application of our result . in a second step we are able to extend our central limit theorem to the case of several asymptotic gaussians , in the case where the operator coefficients of the quantum walk are block - diagonal in a common basis .
