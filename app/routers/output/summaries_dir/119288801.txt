an algorithm is presented for approximating arbitrary powers of a black box unitary operation , $ \mathcal{u}^t$ , where $ t$ is a real number , and $ \mathcal{u}$ is a black box implementing an unknown unitary . the complexity of this algorithm is calculated in terms of the number of calls to the black box , the errors in the approximation , and a certain ` gap ' parameter . for general $ \mathcal{u}$ and large $ t$ , one should apply $ \mathcal{u}$ a total of $ \lfloor t \rfloor$ times followed by our procedure for approximating the fractional power $ \mathcal{u}^{t-\lfloor t \rfloor}$. an example is also given where for large integers $ t$ this method is more efficient than direct application of $ t$ copies of $ \mathcal{u}$. further applications and related algorithms are also discussed .
