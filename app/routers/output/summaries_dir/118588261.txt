we present a scheme for tuning and controlling nano mechanical resonators by subjecting them to electrostatic gradient fields , provided by nearby tip electrodes . we show that this approach enables access to a novel regime of optomechanics , where the intrinsic nonlinearity of the nanoresonator can be explored . in this regime , one or several laser driven cavity modes coupled to the nanoresonator and suitably adjusted gradient fields allow to control the motional state of the nanoresonator at the single phonon level . some applications of this platform have been presented previously [ new j. phys . 14 , 023042 ( 2012 ) , phys . rev . lett . 110 , 120503 ( 2013 ) ] . here , we provide a detailed description of the corresponding setup and its optomechanical coupling mechanisms , together with an in - depth analysis of possible sources of damping or decoherence and a discussion of the readout of the nanoresonator state .
