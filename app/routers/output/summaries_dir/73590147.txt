we extensively test a recent protocol to demonstrate quantum fault tolerance on three systems : ( 1 ) a real - time simulation of five spin qubits coupled to an environment with two - level defects , ( 2 ) a real - time simulation of transmon quantum computers , and ( 3 ) the 16-qubit processor of the ibm q experience . in the simulations , the dynamics of the full system is obtained by numerically solving the time - dependent schr\"odinger equation . we find that the fault - tolerant scheme provides a systematic way to improve the results when the errors are dominated by the inherent control and measurement errors present in transmon systems . however , the scheme fails to satisfy the criterion for fault tolerance when decoherence effects are dominant .
