the dynamics of quantum systems are unavoidably influenced by their environment and in turn observing a quantum system ( probe ) can allow one to measure its environment : measurements and controlled manipulation of the probe such as dynamical decoupling sequences as an extension of the ramsey interference measurement allow to spectrally resolve a noise field coupled to the probe . here , we introduce fast and robust estimation strategies for the characterization of the spectral properties of classical and quantum dephasing environments . these strategies are based on filter function orthogonalization , optimal control filters maximizing the relevant fisher information and multi - qubit entanglement . we investigate and quantify the robustness of the schemes under different types of noise such as finite - precision measurements , dephasing of the probe , spectral leakage and slow temporal fluctuations of the spectrum .
