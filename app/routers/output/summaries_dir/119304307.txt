we consider the scenario in which a damped three - level atom in the ladder or v configurations is coupled to a single cavity mode whose vacuum state is amplified by dint of the dynamical casimir effect . we obtain approximate analytical expressions and exact numerical results for the time - dependent probabilities , demonstrating that the presence of the third level modifies the photon statistics and its population can serve as a witness of photon generation from vacuum .
