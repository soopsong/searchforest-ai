we present new computational building blocks based on memristive devices . these blocks , can be used to implement either supervised or unsupervised learning modules . this is achieved using a crosspoint architecture which is an efficient array implementation for nanoscale two - terminal memristive devices . based on these blocks and an experimentally verified spice macromodel for the memristor , we demonstrate that firstly , the spike - timing - dependent plasticity ( stdp ) can be implemented by a single memristor device and secondly , a memristor - based competitive hebbian learning through stdp using a $ 1\times 1000 $ synaptic network . this is achieved by adjusting the memristor 's conductance values ( weights ) as a function of the timing difference between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes . these implementations have a number of shortcomings due to the memristor 's characteristics such as memory decay , highly nonlinear switching behaviour as a function of applied voltage / current , and functional uniformity . these shortcomings can be addressed by utilising a mixed gates that can be used in conjunction with the analogue behaviour for biomimetic computation . the digital implementations in this paper use in - situ computational capability of the memristor .
