we unify the quantum zeno effect ( qze ) and the"bang - bang"(bb ) decoupling method for suppressing decoherence in open quantum systems : in both cases strong coupling to an external system or apparatus induces a dynamical superselection rule that partitions the open system 's hilbert space into quantum zeno subspaces . our unification makes use of von neumann 's ergodic theorem and avoids making any of the symmetry assumptions usually made in discussions of bb . thus we are able to generalize bb to arbitrary fast and strong pulse sequences , requiring no symmetry , and to show the existence of two alternatives to pulsed bb : continuous decoupling , and pulsed measurements . our unified treatment enables us to derive limits on the efficacy of the bb method : we explicitly show that the inverse qze implies that bb can in some cases accelerate , rather than inhibit , decoherence .
