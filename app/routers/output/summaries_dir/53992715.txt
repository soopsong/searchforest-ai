the first law of thermodynamics imposes not just a constraint on the energy - content of systems in extreme quantum regimes , but also symmetry - constraints related to the thermodynamic processing of quantum coherence . we show that this thermodynamic symmetry decomposes any quantum state into mode operators that quantify the coherence present in the state . we then establish general upper and lower bounds for the evolution of quantum coherence under arbitrary thermal operations , valid for any temperature . we identify primitive coherence manipulations and show that the transfer of coherence between energy levels manifests irreversibility not captured by free energy . moreover , the recently developed thermo - majorization relations on block - diagonal quantum states are observed to be special cases of this symmetry analysis .
