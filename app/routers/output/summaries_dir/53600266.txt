the dynamics and thermal equilibrium of spin waves ( magnons ) in a quantum ferromagnet as well as the macroscopic magnetisation are investigated . thermal noise due to an interaction with lattice phonons and the effects of spatial correlations in the noise are considered . we first present a markovian master equation approach with analytical solutions for any homogeneous spatial correlation function of the noise . we find that spatially correlated noise increases the decay rate of magnons with low wave vectors to their thermal equilibrium , which also leads to a faster decay of the ferromagnet 's magnetisation to its steady - state value . for long correlation lengths and higher temperature we find that additionally there is a component of the magnetisation which decays very slowly , due to a reduced decay rate of fast magnons . this effect could be useful for fast and noise - protected quantum or classical information transfer and magnonics . we further compare ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic behaviour in noisy environments and find qualitatively similar behaviour in ohmic but fundamentally different behaviour in super - ohmic environments .
