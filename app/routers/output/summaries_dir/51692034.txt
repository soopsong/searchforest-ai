we study landau - zener - stueckelberg - majorana ( lzsm ) interferometry under the influence of projective readout using a charge qubit tunnel - coupled to a fermionic sea . this allows us to characterise the coherent charge qubit dynamics in the strong - driving regime . the device is realised within a silicon complementary metal - oxide - semiconductor ( cmos ) transistor . we first read out the charge state of the system in a continuous non - demolition manner by measuring the dispersive response of a high - frequency electrical resonator coupled to the quantum system via the gate . by performing multiple fast passages around the qubit avoided crossing , we observe a multi - passage lzsm interferometry pattern . at larger driving amplitudes , a projective measurement to an even - parity charge state is realised , showing a strong enhancement of the dispersive readout signal . at even larger driving amplitudes , two projective measurements are realised within the coherent evolution resulting in the disappearance of the interference pattern . our results demonstrate a way to increase the state readout signal of coherent quantum systems and replicate single - electron analogues of optical interferometry within a cmos transistor .
