we present security proofs for a protocol for quantum key distribution ( qkd ) based on encoding in finite high - dimensional hilbert spaces . this protocol is an extension of bennett 's and brassard 's basic protocol from two bases , two state encoding to a multi bases , multi state encoding . we analyze the mutual information between the legitimate parties and the eavesdropper , and the error rate , as function of the dimension of the hilbert space , while considering optimal incoherent and coherent eavesdropping attacks . we obtain the upper limit for the legitimate party error rate to ensure unconditional security when the eavesdropper uses incoherent and coherent eavesdropping strategies . we have also consider realistic noise caused by detector 's noise .
