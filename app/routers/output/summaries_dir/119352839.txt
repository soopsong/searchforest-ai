we report on ground state phases of a doped one - dimensional hubbard model , which for large onsite interactions is governed by the $ t$-$j$ hamiltonian , where the extant entanglement is immutable under perturbative or sudden changes of system parameters , a phenomenon termed as adiabatic freezing . we observe that in the metallic luttinger liquid phase of the model bipartite entanglement decays polynomially and is adiabatically frozen , in contrast to the variable , exponential decay in the phase - separation and superconducting spin - gap phases . significantly , at low fixed electron densities , the spin - gap phase shows remarkable affinity to doped resonating valence bond gas , with multipartite entanglement frozen across all parameter space . we note that entanglement , in general , is sensitive to external perturbation , as observed in several systems , and hitherto , no such invariance or freezing behavior has been reported .
