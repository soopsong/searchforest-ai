correlations are important tools in the characterization of quantum fields . they can be used to describe statistical properties of the fields , such as bunching and anti - bunching , as well as to perform field state tomography . here we analyse experiments by bozyigit et al . [ arxiv:1002.3738 ] where correlation functions can be observed using the measurement records of linear detectors ( i.e. quadrature measurements ) , instead of relying on intensity or number detectors . we also describe how large amplitude noise introduced by these detectors can be quantified and subtracted from the data . this enables , in particular , the observation of first- and second - order coherence functions of microwave photon fields generated using circuit quantum - electrodynamics and propagating in superconducting transmission lines under the condition that noise is sufficiently low .
