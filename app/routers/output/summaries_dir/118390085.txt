we investigate theoretically the conditions under which a multi - mode nanomechanical resonator , operated as a purely mechanical parametric oscillator , can be driven into highly nonclassical states . we find that when the device can be cooled to near its ground state , and certain mode matching conditions are satisfied , it is possible to prepare distinct resonator modes in quantum entangled states that violate bell inequalities with homodyne quadrature measurements . we analyze the parameter regimes for such bell inequality violations , and while experimentally challenging , we believe that the realization of such states lies within reach . this is a re - imagining of a quintessential quantum optics experiment by using phonons that represent tangible mechanical vibrations .
