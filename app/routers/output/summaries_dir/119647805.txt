in this paper , we calculate the entanglement negativity in free - fermion systems by use of the overlap matrices . for a tripartite system , if the ground state can be factored into triples of modes , we show that the partially transposed reduced density matrix can be factorized and the entanglement negativity has a simple form . however , the factorability of the ground state in a tripartite system does not hold in general . in this situation , the partially transposed reduced density matrix can be expressed in terms of the kronecker product of matrices . we explicitly compute the entanglement negativity for the su - schrieffer - heeger model , the integer quantum hall state , and a homogeneous one - dimensional chain . we find that the entanglement negativity for the integer quantum hall states shows an area law behavior . for the entanglement negativity of two adjacent intervals in a homogeneous one - dimensional gas , we find agreement with the conformal field theory . our method provides a numerically feasible way to study the entanglement negativity in free - fermion systems .
