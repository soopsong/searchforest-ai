we induce quantum jumps between the hyperfine ground states of one and two cesium atoms , strongly coupled to the mode of a high - finesse optical resonator , and analyze the resulting random telegraph signals . we identify experimental parameters to deduce the atomic spin state nondestructively from the stream of photons transmitted through the cavity , achieving a compromise between a good signal - to - noise ratio and minimal measurement - induced perturbations . in order to extract optimum information about the spin dynamics from the photon count signal , a bayesian update formalism is employed , which yields time - dependent probabilities for the atoms to be in either hyperfine state . we discuss the effect of super - poissonian photon number distributions caused by atomic motion .
