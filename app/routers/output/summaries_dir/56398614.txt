we have designed and fabricated superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators with fundamental frequencies from 2 to $ 9 \rm{ghz}$ and loaded quality factors ranging from a few hundreds to a several hundred thousands reached at temperatures of $ 20 \rm{mk}$. the loaded quality factors are controlled by appropriately designed input and output coupling capacitors . the measured transmission spectra are analyzed using both a lumped element model and a distributed element transmission matrix method . the experimentally determined resonance frequencies , quality factors and insertion losses are fully and consistently characterized by the two models for all measured devices . such resonators find prominent applications in quantum optics and quantum information processing with superconducting electronic circuits and in single photon detectors and parametric amplifiers .
