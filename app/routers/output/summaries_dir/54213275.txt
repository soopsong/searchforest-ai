autonomous quantum error correction utilizes the engineered coupling of a quantum system to a dissipative ancilla to protect quantum logical states from decoherence . we show that the knill - laflamme condition , stating that the environmental error operators should act trivially on a subspace , which then becomes the code subspace , is sufficient for logical qudits to be protected against markovian noise . it is proven that the error caused by the total lindbladian evolution in the code subspace can be suppressed up to very long times in the limit of large engineered dissipation , by explicitly deriving how the error scales with both time and engineered dissipation strength . to demonstrate the potential of our approach for applications , we implement our general theory with binomial codes , a class of bosonic error - correcting codes , and outline how they can be implemented in a fully autonomous manner to protect against photon loss in a microwave cavity .
