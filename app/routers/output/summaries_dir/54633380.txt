the problem of photon - photon interaction controlled by a two - level system is studied in this paper . specifically , we have proposed two scenarios : case 1 , how a two - level system changes the pulse shapes of two initially uncorrelated input photons in a single input channel ; and case 2 , how a two - level system entangles two counter - propagating photons , one in each input channel . the steady - state output field states for both cases are derived explicitly . for case 1 , the wigner spectrum is used to exhibit the interesting properties of the output field state . for case 2 , the nonlinear property of the interaction between the two - level system and the two input photons has been revealed by the probabilities of observing photons in the output channels . in addition , two - photon interference , similar to hong - ou - mandel effect , occurs when the two input photons are chosen with the same pulse shape .
