the newfound importance of ` ` entanglement as a resource ' ' in quantum computation and quantum communication compels us to quantify it in as many distinct ways as possible . here we explore a new measure of entanglement for mixed quantum states of bipartite systems , which we name the entanglement of assistance . we show it to be the maximum average entanglement of all pure - state ensembles consistent with the given density matrix . in this sense , the entanglement of assistance is a quantity directly dual to the more standard entanglement of formation . with the help of lower and upper bounds , we calculate the entanglement of assistance for a few cases and use these results to show that it possesses the surprising property of superadditivity . we believe that this may shed some light on the question of additivity for the entanglement of formation .
