faithful storage and coherent manipulation of quantum optical pulses are key for long distance quantum communications and quantum computing . combining these functions in a light - matter interface that can be integrated on - chip with other photonic quantum technologies , e.g. sources of entangled photons , is an important step towards these applications . to date there have only been a few demonstrations of coherent pulse manipulation utilizing optical storage devices compatible with quantum states , and that only in atomic gas media ( making integration difficult ) and with limited capabilities . here we describe how a broadband waveguide quantum memory based on the atomic frequency comb ( afc ) protocol can be used as a programmable processor for essentially arbitrary spectral and temporal manipulations of individual quantum optical pulses . using weak coherent optical pulses at the few photon level , we experimentally demonstrate sequencing , time - to - frequency multiplexing and demultiplexing , splitting , interfering , temporal and spectral filtering , compressing and stretching as well as selective delaying . our integrated light - matter interface offers high - rate , robust and easily configurable manipulation of quantum optical pulses and brings fully practical optical quantum devices one step closer to reality . furthermore , as the afc protocol is suitable for storage of intense light pulses , our processor may also find applications in classical communications .
