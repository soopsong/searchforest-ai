parametric instabilities have long been studied as a potentially limiting effect in high - power interferometric gravitational wave detectors . until now , however , these instabilities have never been observed in a kilometer - scale interferometer . in this work we describe the first observation of parametric instability in an advanced ligo detector , and the means by which it has been removed as a barrier to progress .
