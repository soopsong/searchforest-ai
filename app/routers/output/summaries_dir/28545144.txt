we apply the method of transitionless quantum driving for time - dependent quantum systems to spin systems . for a given hamiltonian , the driving hamiltonian is constructed so that the adiabatic states of the original system obey the schroedinger equation . for several typical systems such as the xy spin chain and the lipkin - meshkov - glick model , the driving hamiltonian is constructed explicitly . we discuss possible interesting situations when the driving hamiltonian becomes time independent and when the driving hamiltonian is equivalent to the original one . for many - body systems , a crucial problem occurs at the quantum phase transition point where the energy gap between the ground and first excited states becomes zero . we discuss how the defect can be circumvented in the present method .
