self - assembled quantum dots are ideal structures in which to test theories of open quantum systems : confined exciton states can be coherently manipulated and their decoherence properties are dominated by interactions with acoustic phonons . we here describe the interaction of a pair of un - coupled , driven , quantum dot excitons with a common phonon environment , and find that this coupling effectively generates two kinds of interaction between the two quantum dots : an elastic coupling mediated by virtual phonons and an inelastic coupling mediated by real phonons . we show that both of these interactions produce steady state entanglement between the two quantum dot excitons . we also show that photon correlations in the emission of the quantum dots can provide a signature of the common environment . experiments to demonstrate our predictions are feasible with the state - of - the - art technology and would provide valuable insight into quantum dot carrier - phonon dynamics .
