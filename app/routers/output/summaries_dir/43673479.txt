we study one - step implementation of the fredkin gate in a bi - modal cavity under both resonant and large detuning conditions based on quantum zeno dynamics , which reduces the complexity of experiment operations . the influence of cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission is discussed by numerical calculation . the results demonstrate that the fidelity and the success probability are robust against cavity decay in both models and they are also insensitive to atomic spontaneous emission in the large detuning model . in addition , the interaction time is rather short in the resonant model compared to the large detuning model .
