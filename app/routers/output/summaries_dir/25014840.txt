we investigate on the procedure of extracting a"spectral density"from mixed qm / mm calculations and employing it in open quantum systems models . in particular , we study the connection between the energy gap correlation function extracted from ground state qm / mm and the bath spectral density used as input in open quantum system approaches . we introduce a simple model which can give intuition on when the ground state qm / mm propagation will give the correct energy gap . we also discuss the role of higher order correlators of the energy - gap fluctuations which can provide useful information on the bath . further , various semiclassical corrections to the spectral density , are applied and investigated . finally , we apply our considerations to the photosynthetic fenna - matthews - olson complex . for this system , our results suggest the use of the harmonic prefactor for the spectral density rather than the standard one , which was employed in the simulations of the system carried out to date .
