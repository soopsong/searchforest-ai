the effect of non - orthogonality of an entangled non - orthogonal state based quantum channel is investigated in detail in the context of the teleportation of a qubit . specifically , average fidelity , minimum fidelity and minimum assured fidelity ( masfi ) are obtained for teleportation of a single qubit state using all the bell type entangled non - orthogonal states known as quasi bell states . using horodecki criterion , it is shown that the teleportation scheme obtained by replacing the quantum channel ( bell state ) of the usual teleportation scheme by a quasi bell state is optimal . further , the performance of various quasi bell states as teleportation channel is compared in an ideal situation ( i.e. , in the absence of noise ) and under different noise models ( e.g. , amplitude and phase damping channels ) . it is observed that the best choice of the quasi bell state depends on the amount non - orthogonality , both in noisy and noiseless case . a specific quasi bell state , which was found to be maximally entangled in the ideal conditions , is shown to be less efficient as a teleportation channel compared to other quasi bell states in particular cases when subjected to noisy channels . it has also been observed that usually the value of average fidelity falls with an increase in the number of qubits exposed to noisy channels ( viz . , alice 's , bob 's and to be teleported qubits ) , but the converse may be observed in some particular cases .
