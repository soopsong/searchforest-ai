in this paper we describe how three qubit entanglement can be analyzed with local measurements . for this purpose we decompose entanglement witnesses into operators which can be measured locally . our decompositions are optimized in the number of measurement settings needed for the measurement of one witness . our method allows to detect true threepartite entanglement and especially ghz - states with only four measurement settings .
