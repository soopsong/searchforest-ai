optical circulators are important components of modern day communication technology . with their ability to route photons directionally , these nonreciprocal elements provide useful functionality in photonic circuits and offer prospects for fundamental research on information processing . developing highly efficient optical circulators thus presents an important challenge , in particular to realize compact reconfigurable implementations that do not rely on a magnetic field bias to break reciprocity . we demonstrate optical circulation based on radiation pressure interactions in an on - chip multimode optomechanical system . we show that mechanically - mediated optical mode conversion in a silica microtoroid provides a synthetic gauge bias for light , which enables a 4-port circulator by exploiting tailored interference between appropriate light paths . we identify two sideband conditions under which ideal circulation is approached . this allows to experimentally demonstrate $ \sim$10 db isolation and $ < $ 3 db insertion loss in all relevant channels . we show the possibility of actively controlling the bandwidth , isolation ratio , noise performance and circulation direction , enabling ideal opportunities for reconfigurable integrated nanophotonic circuits .
