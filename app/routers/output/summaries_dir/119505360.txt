we consider the general problem of the quantum noise in a multipixel measurement of an optical image . we first give a precise criterium in order to characterize intrinsic single mode and multimode light . then , using a transverse mode decomposition , for each type of possible linear combination of the pixels ' outputs we give the exact expression of the detection mode , i.e. the mode carrying the noise . we give also the only way to reduce the noise in one or several simultaneous measurements .
