within the unified framework of exploiting the relative entropy as a distance measure of quantum correlations , we make explicit the hierarchical structure of quantum coherence , quantum discord and quantum entanglement in multipartite systems . on this basis , we introduce a new measure of quantum coherence , the basis - free quantum coherence and prove that this quantity is exactly equivalent to quantum discord . furthermore , since the original relative entropy of coherence is a basis - dependent quantity , we investigate the local and nonlocal unitary creation of quantum coherence , focusing on the two - qubit unitary gates . intriguingly , our results demonstrate that nonlocal unitary gates do not necessarily outperform the local unitary gates . finally , the additivity relationship of quantum coherence in tripartite systems is discussed in detail , where the strong subadditivity of von neumann entropy plays an essential role .
