we put forward a proposal that combines objective collapse models , developed in connection with quantum - foundational questions , with the so - called weyl curvature hypothesis , introduced by roger penrose as an attempt to account for the very special initial state of the universe . in particular , we explain how a curvature dependence of the collapse rate in such models , an idea already shown to help in the context of black holes and information loss , could also offer a dynamical justification for penrose 's conjecture .
