the dynamical casimir effect is an intriguing phenomenon in which photons are generated from vacuum due to a non - adiabatic change in some boundary conditions . in particular , it connects the motion of an accelerated mechanical mirror to the generation of photons . while pioneering experiments demonstrating this effect exist , a conclusive measurement involving a mechanical generation is still missing . we show that a hybrid system consisting of a piezoelectric mechanical resonator coupled to a superconducting cavity may allow to electro - mechanically generate measurable photons from vacuum , intrinsically associated to the dynamical casimir effect . such an experiment may be achieved with current technology , based on film bulk acoustic resonators directly coupled to a superconducting cavity . our results predict a measurable photon generation rate , which can be further increased through additional improvements such as using superconducting metamaterials .
