we describe a method for improving coherent control through the use of detailed knowledge of the system 's hamiltonian . precise unitary transformations were obtained by strongly modulating the system 's dynamics to average out unwanted evolution . with the aid of numerical search methods , pulsed irradiation schemes are obtained that perform accurate , arbitrary , selective gates on multi - qubit systems . compared to low power selective pulses , which can not average out all unwanted evolution , these pulses are substantially shorter in time , thereby reducing the effects of relaxation . liquid - state nmr techniques on homonuclear spin systems are used to demonstrate the accuracy of these gates both in simulation and experiment . simulations of the coherent evolution of a 3-qubit system show that the control sequences faithfully implement the unitary operations , typically yielding gate fidelities on the order of 0.999 and , for some sequences , up to 0.9997 . the experimentally determined density matrices resulting from the application of different control sequences on a 3-spin system have overlaps of up to 0.99 with the expected states , confirming the quality of the experimental implementation .
