taking partial traces for computing reduced density matrices , or related functions , is a ubiquitous procedure in the quantum mechanics of composite systems . in this article , we present a thorough description of this function and analyze the number of elementary operations ( ops ) needed , under some possible alternative implementations , to compute it on a classical computer . as we notice , it is worthwhile doing some analytical developments in order to avoid making null multiplications and sums , what can considerably reduce the ops . for instance , for a bipartite system $ \mathcal{h}_{a}\otimes\mathcal{h}_{b}$ with dimensions $ d_{a}=\dim\mathcal{h}_{a}$ and $ d_{b}=\dim\mathcal{h}_{b}$ and for $ d_{a},d_{b}\gg1 $ , while a direct use of partial trace definition applied to $ \mathcal{h}_{b}$ requires $ \mathcal{o}(d_{a}^{6}d_{b}^{6})$ ops , its optimized implementation entails $ \mathcal{o}(d_{a}^{2}d_{b})$ ops . in the sequence , we regard the computation of partial traces for general multipartite systems and describe fortran code provided to implement it numerically . we also consider the calculation of reduced density matrices via bloch 's parametrization with generalized gell mann 's matrices .
