we describe an entanglement purification protocol ( epp ) for multipartite three - level atomic entangled pair using photonic faraday rotation . in this epp , the multipartite atomic entangled state can be purified with the help of some single photons . this protocol resorts to the photonic faraday rotation to realize the function of the controlled - not ( cnot ) gate . the purified multipartite atomic entangled state can be retained and to be repeated to reach a higher fidelity .
