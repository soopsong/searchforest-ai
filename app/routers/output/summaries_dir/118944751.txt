we study the physics of four - photon states generated in spontaneous parametric down - conversion with a pulsed pump field . in the limit where the coherence time of the photons t_c is much shorter than the duration of the pump pulse delta t , the four photons can be described as two independent pairs . in the opposite limit , the four photons are in a four - particle entangled state . any intermediate case can be characterized by a single parameter chi , which is a function of t_c / delta t. we present a direct measurement of chi through a simple experimental setup . the full theoretical analysis is also provided .
