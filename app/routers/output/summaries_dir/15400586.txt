we study the roughening transition of the dual of the 2d xy model , of the discrete gaussian model , of the absolute value solid - on - solid model and of the interface in an ising model on a 3d simple cubic lattice . the investigation relies on a renormalization group finite size scaling method that was proposed and successfully tested a few years ago . the basic idea is to match the renormalization group flow of the interface observables with that of the exactly solvable bcsos model . our estimates for the critical couplings are $ \beta_r^{xy}=1.1199(1)$ , $ k_r^{dg}=0.6653(2)$ and $ k_r^{asos}=0.80608(2)$ for the xy - model , the discrete gaussian model and the absolute value solid - on - solid model , respectively . for the inverse roughening temperature of the ising interface we find $ k_r^{ising}= 0.40758(1)$. to the best of our knowledge , these are the most precise estimates for these parameters published so far .
