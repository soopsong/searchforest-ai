the coherent dipole - dipole interactions of atoms in an atomic array are studied . it is found that the excitation probability of an atom in an array parallel to the direction of laser propagation ( $ \boldsymbol{\hat{k}}$ ) will either grow or decay logarithmically along $ \boldsymbol{\hat{k}}$ , depending on the detuning of the laser . the symmetry of the system for atomic separations of $ \delta r = j\lambda/2 $ , where $ j$ is an integer , causes the excitation distribution and scattered radiation to abruptly become symmetric about the center of the array . for atomic separations of $ \delta r<\lambda/2 $ , the appearance of a collection of extremely subradiant states ( $ \gamma\sim 0 $ ) , disrupts the described trend . in order to interpret the results from a finite array of atoms , a band structure calculation in the $ n\rightarrow \infty$ limit is conducted where the decay rates and the collective lamb shifts of the eigenmodes along the brillouin zone are shown . finally , the band structure of an array strongly affects its scattered radiation , allowing one to manipulate the collective lamb shift as well as the decay rate ( from superradiant to subradiant ) by changing the angle of the driving laser .
