memory effects can be studied through a conditional past - future correlation , which measures departure with respect to a conditional past - future independence valid in a memoryless markovian regime . in a quantum regime this property leads to an operational definition of quantum non - markovianity based on three consecutive system measurement processes and postselection [ budini , phys . rev . lett . 121 , 240401 ( 2018 ) ] . here , we study the conditional past - future correlation for a qubit system coupled to different dephasing environments . exact solutions are obtained for a quantum spin bath as well as for classically fluctuating random hamiltonian models . the developing of memory effects and departures from born - markov or white - noise approximations are related to a measurement back action that changes the system dynamics between consecutive measurements . it is shown that this effect may develop even when the former system evolution is given by a time - independent lindblad equation . this unusual non - markovian case arises when the characteristic parameters of the dynamics become lorentzian random distributed variables .
