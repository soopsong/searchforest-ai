recently pikovski et al . have proposed in [ pikovski i et al . 2015 nature phys . 11 , 668 ] an intriguing universal decoherence mechanism , suggesting that gravitation may play a conceptually important role in the quantum - to - classical transition , albeit vanishingly small in everyday situations . here we analyze information transfer induced by this mechanism . we show that generically on short time - scales , gravitational decoherence leads to a redundant information encoding , which results in a form of objectivization of the center - of - mass position in the gravitational field . we derive the relevant time - scales of this process , given in terms of energy dispersion and quantum fisher information . as an example we study thermal coherent states and show certain robustness of the effect with the temperature . finally , we draw an analogy between our objectivization mechanism and the fundamental problem of point individuation in general relativity as emphasized by the einstein 's hole argument .
