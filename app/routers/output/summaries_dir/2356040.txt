a memristor is often identified by showing its distinctive pinched hysteresis curve and testing for the effect of frequency . the hysteresis size should relate to frequency and shrink to zero as the frequency approaches infinity . although mathematically understood , the material causes for this are not well known . the d.c . response of the memristor is a decaying curve with its own timescale . we show via mathematical reasoning that this decaying curve when transformed to a.c . leads to the frequency effect by considering a descretized curve . we then demonstrate the validity of this approach with experimental data from two different types of memristors .
