the vision of a quantum internet is to fundamentally enhance internet technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on earth . while the first realisations of small scale quantum networks are expected in the near future , scaling such networks presents immense challenges to physics , computer science and engineering . here , we provide a gentle introduction to quantum networking targeted at computer scientists , and survey the state of the art . we proceed to discuss key challenges for computer science in order to make such networks a reality .
