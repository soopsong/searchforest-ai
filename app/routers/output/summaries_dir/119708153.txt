we consider a class of one - dimensional quantum spin systems on the finite lattice $ \lambda\subset\mathbb{z}$ , related to the xxz spin chain in its ising phase . it includes in particular the so - called droplet hamiltonian . the entanglement entropy of energetically low - lying states over a bipartition $ \lambda = b \cup b^c$ is investigated and proven to satisfy a logarithmic bound in terms of $ \min\lbrace n,\vert b\vert,\vert b^c\vert\rbrace$ , where $ n$ denotes the maximal number of down spins in the considered state . upon addition of any ( positive ) random potential the bound becomes uniformly constant on average , thereby establishing an area law . the proof is based on spectral methods : a deterministic bound on the local ( many - body integrated ) density of states is derived from an energetically motivated combes -- thomas estimate .
