the unitary evaporation of a black hole ( bh ) in an initially pure state must lead to the eventual purification of the emitted radiation . it follows that the late radiation has to be entangled with the early radiation and , as a consequence , the entanglement among the hawking pair partners has to decrease continuously from maximal to vanishing during the bh 's life span . starting from the basic premise that both the horizon radius and the center of mass of a finite - mass bh are fluctuating quantum mechanically , we show how this process is realized . first , it is shown that the horizon fluctuations induce a small amount of variance in the total linear momentum of each created pair . this is in contrast to the case of an infinitely massive bh , for which the total momentum of the produced pair vanishes exactly on account of momentum conservation . this variance leads to a random recoil of the bh during each emission and , as a result , the center of mass of the bh undergoes a quantum random walk . consequently , the uncertainty in its momentum grows as the square root of the number of emissions . we then show that this uncertainty controls the amount of deviation from maximal entanglement of the produced pairs and that this deviation is determined by the ratio of the cumulative number of emitted particles to the initial bh entropy . thus , the interplay between the horizon and center - of - mass fluctuations provides a mechanism for teleporting entanglement from the pair partners to the bh and the emitted radiation .
