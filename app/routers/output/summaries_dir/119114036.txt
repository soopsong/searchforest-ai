we explore the butterfly effect for black holes with rotation or charge . we perturb rotating btz and charged black holes in 2 + 1 dimensions by adding a small perturbation on one asymptotic region , described by a shock wave in the spacetime , and explore the effect of this shock wave on the length of geodesics through the wormhole and hence on correlation functions . we find the effect of the perturbation grows exponentially at a rate controlled by the temperature ; dependence on the angular momentum or charge does not appear explicitly . we comment on issues affecting the extension to higher - dimensional charged black holes .
