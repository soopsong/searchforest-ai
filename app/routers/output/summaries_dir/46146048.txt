we present a method designed to efficiently extract optical signals from ingaas avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) operated in gated mode . in particular , our method permits an estimation of the fraction of counts which actually results from the signal being measured , as opposed to being produced by noise mechanisms , specifically by afterpulsing . our method in principle allows the use of ingaas apds at high detection efficiencies , with the full operation bandwidth , either with or without resorting to the application of a dead time . as we show below , our method can be used in configurations where afterpulsing exceeds the genuine signal by orders of magnitude , even near saturation . the algorithms which we have developed are suitable to be used either in real - time processing of raw detection probabilities or in post - processing applications , after a calibration step has been performed . the algorithms which we propose here can complement technologies designed for the reduction of afterpulsing .
