bell inequality violation is one of the most widely known manifestations of entanglement in quantum mechanics ; indicating that experiments on physically separated quantum mechanical systems can not be given a local realistic description . however , despite the importance of bell inequalities , it is not known in general how to determine whether a given entangled state will violate a bell inequality . this is because one can choose to make many different measurements on a quantum system to test any given bell inequality and the optimization over measurements is a high - dimensional variational problem . in order to better understand this problem we present algorithms that provide , for a given quantum state , both a lower bound and an upper bound on the maximal expectation value of a bell operator . both bounds apply techniques from convex optimization and the methodology for creating upper bounds allows them to be systematically improved . in many cases these bounds determine measurements that would demonstrate violation of the bell inequality or provide a bound that rules out the possibility of a violation . examples are given to illustrate how these algorithms can be used to conclude definitively if some quantum states violate a given bell inequality .
