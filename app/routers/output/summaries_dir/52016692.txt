quantum amplifier is an essential device in quantum information processing . as in the classical ( non - quantum ) case , its characteristic uncertainty needs to be suppressed by feedback , and in fact such a control theory for a single quantum amplifier has recently been developed . this letter extends this result to the case of cascaded quantum amplifier . in particular , we consider two types of structures : the case where controlled amplifiers are connected in series , and the case where a single feedback control is applied to the cascaded amplifier . then , we prove that the latter is better in the sense of sensitivity to the uncertainty . a detailed numerical simulation is given to show actual performance of these two feedback schemes .
