this paper presents a study of bifurcation in the time - averaged dynamics of tao memristors driven by narrow pulses of alternating polarities . the analysis , based on a physics - inspired model , focuses on the stable fixed points and on how these are affected by the pulse parameters . our main finding is the identification of a driving regime when two stable fixed points exist simultaneously . to the best of our knowledge , such bistability is identified in a single memristor for the first time . this result can be readily tested experimentally , and is expected to be useful in future memristor circuit designs .
