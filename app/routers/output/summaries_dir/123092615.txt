one of the main challenges in quantum technologies is the ability to control individual quantum systems . this task becomes increasingly difficult as the dimension of the system grows . here we propose a general setup for cyclic permutations $ x_d$ in $ d$ dimensions , a major primitive for constructing arbitrary qudit gates . using orbital angular momentum states as a qudit , the simplest implementation of the $ x_d$ gate in $ d$ dimensions requires a single quantum sorter $ s_d$ and two spiral phase plates . we then extend this construction to a generalised $ x_d(p)$ gate to perform a cyclic permutation of a set of $ d$ , equally spaced values $ \ { \ket{\ell_0 } , \ket{\ell_0+p},\ldots , \ket{\ell_0+(d-1)p } \ } \mapsto \ { \ket{\ell_0+p } , \ket { \ell_0 + 2p},\ldots , \ket{\ell_0 } \}$. we find compact implementations for the generalised $ x_d(p)$ gate in both michelson ( one sorter $ s_d$ , two spiral phase plates ) and mach - zehnder configurations ( two sorters $ s_d$ , two spiral phase plates ) . remarkably , the number of spiral phase plates is independent of the qudit dimension $ d$. our architecture for $ x_d$ and generalised $ x_d(p)$ gate will enable complex quantum algorithms for qudits , for example quantum protocols using photonic oam states .
