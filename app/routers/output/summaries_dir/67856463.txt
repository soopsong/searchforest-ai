quantum key distribution ( qkd ) via satellite offers up the possibility of unconditionally secure communications on a global scale . increasing the secret key rate in such systems , via photonic engineering at the source , is a topic of much ongoing research . in this work we investigate the use of photon - added states and photon - subtracted states , derived from two mode squeezed vacuum states , as examples of such photonic engineering . specifically , we determine which engineered - photonic state provides for better qkd performance when implemented over channels connecting terrestrial receivers with low - earth - orbit satellites . we quantify the impact the number of photons that are added or subtracted has , and highlight the role played by the adopted model for atmospheric turbulence and loss on the predicted key rates . our results are presented in terms of the complexity of deployment used , with the simplest deployments ignoring any estimate of the channel , and the more sophisticated deployments involving a feedback loop that is used to optimize the key rate for each channel estimation . the optimal quantum state is identified for each deployment scenario investigated .
