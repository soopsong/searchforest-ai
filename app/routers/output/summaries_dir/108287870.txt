we study the renyi entropy in the finite temperature crossover regime of a hubbard chain using quantum monte carlo . the ground state entropy has characteristic features such as a logarithmic divergence with block size and $ 2\kf$ oscillations that are a hallmark of its luttinger liquid nature . the interplay between the ( extensive ) thermal entropy and the ground state features is studied and we analyze the temperature induced decay of the amplitude of the oscillations as well as the scaling of the purity . furthermore , we show how the spin and charge velocities can be extracted from the temperature dependence of the renyi entropy , bridging our findings to recent experimental proposals on how to implement the measurement of renyi entropies in cold atom system . studying the renyi mutual information , we also demonstrate how constraints such as particle number conservation can induce persistent correlations visible in the mutual information even at high temperature .
