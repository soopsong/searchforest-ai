fiber - based optical microcavities exhibit high quality factor and low mode volume resonances that make them attractive for coupling light to individual atoms or other microscopic systems . moreover , their low mass should lead to excellent mechanical response up to high frequencies , opening the possibility for high bandwidth stabilization of the cavity length . here , we demonstrate a locking bandwidth of 44 khz achieved using a simple , compact design that exploits these properties . owing to the simplicity of fiber feedthroughs and lack of free - space alignment , this design is inherently compatible with vacuum and cryogenic environments . we measure the transfer function of the feedback circuit ( closed - loop ) and the cavity mount itself ( open - loop ) , which , combined with simulations of the mechanical response of our device , provide insight into underlying limitations of the design as well as further improvements that can be made .
