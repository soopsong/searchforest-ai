perturbation theory ( pt ) is a powerful and commonly used tool in the investigation of closed quantum systems . in the context of open quantum systems , pt based on the markovian quantum master equation is much less developed . the investigation of open systems mostly relies on exact diagonalization of the liouville superoperator or quantum trajectories . in this approach , the system size is rather limited by current computational capabilities . analogous to closed - system pt , we develop a pt suitable for open quantum systems . this proposed method is useful in the analytical understanding of open systems as well as in the numerical calculation of system properties , which would otherwise be impractical .
