the dicke model describes n qubits ( or two - level atoms ) homogenously coupled to a bosonic mode . here we examine an open - system realization of the dicke model , which contains critical and chaotic behaviour . in particular , we extend this model to include an additional open transport qubit ( tq ) ( coupled to the bosonic mode ) for passive and active measurements . we illustrate how the scaling ( in the number of qubits n ) of the superradiant phase transition can be observed in both current and current - noise measurements through the transport qubit . using a master equation , we also investigate how the phase transition is affected by the back - action from the transport qubit and losses in the cavity . in addition , we show that the non - integrable quantum chaotic character of the dicke model is retained in an open - system environment . we propose how all of these effects could been seen in a circuit qed system formed from an array of superconducting qubits , or an atom chip , coupled to a quantized resonant cavity ( e.g. , a microwave transmission line ) .
