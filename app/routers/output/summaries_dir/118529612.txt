although nonclassical quantum states are important both conceptually and as a resource for quantum technology , it is often difficult to test whether a given quantum system displays nonclassicality . a simple method to certify nonclassicality is introduced , based on easily accessible collective atomic quadrature measurements , without the need of full state tomography . the statistics is analyzed beyond the ground - state noise level , by direct sampling of a regularized atomic quadrature quasiprobability . nonclassicality of a squeezed ensemble of 2x10 ^ 5 cesium atoms is demonstrated , with a significance of up to 23 standard deviations .
