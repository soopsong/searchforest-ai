we study the modification of a traditional electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) stored light technique that includes both eit and four - wave mixing ( fwm ) in an ensemble of hot rb atoms . the standard treatment of light storage involves the coherent and reversible mapping of one photonic mode onto a collective spin coherence . it has been shown that unwanted , competing processes such as four - wave mixing are enhanced by eit and can significantly modify the signal optical pulse propagation . we present theoretical and experimental evidence to indicate that while a stokes field is indeed detected upon retrieval of the signal field , any information originally encoded in a seeded stokes field is not independently preserved during the storage process . we present a simple model that describes the propagation dynamics of the fields and the impact of fwm on the spin wave .
