we discuss the generation of entanglement between electronic states of two atoms in a cavity using direct quantum feedback schemes . we compare the effects of different control hamiltonians and detection processes in the performance of entanglement production and show that the quantum - jump - based feedback proposed by us in phys . rev . a { \bf 76 } 010301(r ) ( 2007 ) can protect highly entangled states against decoherence . we provide analytical results that explain the robustness of jump feedback , and also analyse the perspectives of experimental implementation by scrutinising the effects of imperfections and approximations in our model .
