a scheme making use of an isolated feedback loop was recently proposed in \cite{gp _ } for creating an arbitrary bilinear hamiltonian interaction between two multi - mode linear quantum stochastic systems ( lqsss ) . in this work we examine the presence of an isolated feedback loop in a general slh network , and derive the modified hamiltonian of the network due to the presence of the loop . in the case of a bipartite network with an isolated loop running through both parts , this results in modified hamiltonians for each subnetwork , as well as a hamiltonian interaction between them . as in the lqss case , by engineering appropriate ports in each subnetwork , we may create desired interactions between them . examples are provided that illustrate the general theory .
