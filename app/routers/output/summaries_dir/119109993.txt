measurement - based quantum computing ( mbqc ) is a model of quantum computing that proceeds by sequential measurements of individual spins in an entangled resource state . however , it remains a challenge to produce efficiently such resource states . would it be possible to generate these states by simply cooling a quantum many - body system to its ground state ? cluster states , the canonical resource states for mbqc , do not occur naturally as unique ground states of physical systems . this inherent hurdle has led to a significant effort to identify alternative resource states that appear as ground states in spin lattices . recently , some interesting candidates have been identified with various valence - bond - solid ( vbs ) states . in this review , we provide a pedagogical introduction to recent progress regarding mbqc with vbs states as possible resource states . this study has led to an interesting interdisciplinary research area at the interface of quantum information science and condensed matter physics .
