the entropic uncertainty relation with quantum side information ( eur - qsi ) from [ berta et al . , nat . phys . 6 , 659 ( 2010 ) ] is a unifying principle relating two distinctive features of quantum mechanics : quantum uncertainty due to measurement incompatibility , and entanglement . in these relations , quantum uncertainty takes the form of preparation uncertainty where one of two incompatible measurements is applied . in particular , the"uncertainty witness"lower bound in the eur - qsi is not a function of a post - measurement state . an insightful proof of the eur - qsi from [ coles et al . , phys . rev . lett . 108 , 210405 ( 2012 ) ] makes use of a fundamental mathematical consequence of the postulates of quantum mechanics known as the non - increase of quantum relative entropy under quantum channels . here , we exploit this perspective to establish a tightening of the eur - qsi which adds a new state - dependent term in the lower bound , related to how well one can reverse the action of a quantum measurement . as such , this new term is a direct function of the post - measurement state and can be thought of as quantifying how much disturbance a given measurement causes . our result thus quantitatively unifies this feature of quantum mechanics with the others mentioned above . we have experimentally tested our theoretical predictions on the ibm quantum experience and find reasonable agreement between our predictions and experimental outcomes .
