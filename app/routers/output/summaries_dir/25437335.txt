we present the experimental implementation and theoretical model of a controllable dephasing quantum channel using photonic systems . the channel is implemented by coupling the polarization and the spatial distribution of light , that play , in the perspective of open quantum systems , the role of quantum system and environment , respectively . the capability of controlling our channel allows us to visualize its effects in a quantum system . differently from standard dephasing channels , our channel presents an exotic behavior in the sense that the evolution of a state , from a pure to a mixed state , shows an oscillatory behavior if tracked in the bloch sphere . additionally , we report the evolution of the purity and perform a quantum process tomography to obtain the \chi matrix associated to our channel .
