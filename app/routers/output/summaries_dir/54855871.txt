we study an anisotropic holographic bottom - up model displaying a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) between a topologically trivial insulator and a non - trivial weyl semimetal phase . we analyze the properties of quantum chaos in the quantum critical region . we do not find any universal property of the butterfly velocity across the qpt . in particular it turns out to be either maximized or minimized at the quantum critical point depending on the direction of propagation . we observe that instead of the butterfly velocity , it is the dimensionless information screening length that is always maximized at a quantum critical point . we argue that the null - energy condition ( nec ) is the underlying reason for the upper bound , which now is just a simple combination of the number of spatial dimensions and the anisotropic scaling parameter .
