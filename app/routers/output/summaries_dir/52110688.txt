this paper proposes a quantum - classical algorithm to evaluate and select classical artificial neural networks architectures . the proposed algorithm is based on a probabilistic quantum memory and the possibility to train artificial neural networks in superposition . we obtain an exponential quantum speedup in the evaluation of neural networks . we also verify experimentally through a reduced experimental analysis that the proposed algorithm can be used to select near - optimal neural networks .
