the study of optomechanical systems has attracted much attention , most of which are concentrated in the physics in the small - amplitude regime . while in this article , we focus on optomechanics in the extremely - large - amplitude regime and consider both classical and quantum dynamics . firstly , we study classical dynamics in a membrane - in - the - middle optomechanical system in which a partially reflecting and flexible membrane is suspended inside an optical cavity . we show that the membrane can present self - sustained oscillations with limit cycles in the shape of sawtooth - edged ellipses and exhibit dynamical multistability . then , we study the dynamics of the quantum fluctuations around the classical orbits . by using the logarithmic negativity , we calculate the evolution of the quantum entanglement between the optical cavity mode and the membrane during the mechanical oscillation . we show that there is some synchronism between the classical dynamical process and the evolution of the quantum entanglement .
