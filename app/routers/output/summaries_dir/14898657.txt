we demonstrate the relevance of complex gaussian stochastic processes to the stochastic state vector description of non - markovian open quantum systems . these processes express the general feynman - vernon path integral propagator for open quantum systems as the classical ensemble average over stochastic pure state propagators in a natural way . they are the coloured generalization of complex wiener processes in quantum state diffusion stochastic schrodinger equations .
