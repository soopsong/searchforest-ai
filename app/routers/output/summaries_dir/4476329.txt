we analyze the entropy production and the maximal extractable work from a squeezed thermal reservoir . the nonequilibrium quantum nature of the reservoir induces an entropy transfer with a coherent contribution while modifying its thermal part , allowing work extraction from a single reservoir , as well as great improvements in power and efficiency for quantum heat engines . introducing a modified quantum otto cycle , our approach fully characterizes operational regimes forbidden in the standard case , such as refrigeration and work extraction at the same time , accompanied by efficiencies equal to unity .
