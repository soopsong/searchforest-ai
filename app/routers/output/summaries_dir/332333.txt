we consider a system composed of a single artificial atom coupled to a cavity mode . the artificial atom is biased such that the most dominant relaxation process in the system takes the atom from its ground state to its excited state , thus ensuring population inversion . a recent experimental manifestation of this situation was achieved using a voltage - biased superconducting charge qubit . even under the condition of ` inverted relaxation ' , lasing action can be suppressed if the ` relaxation ' rate is larger than a certain threshold value . using simple transition - rate arguments and a semiclassical calculation , we derive analytic expressions for the lasing suppression condition and the state of the cavity in both the lasing and suppressed - lasing regimes . the results of numerical calculations agree very well with the analytically derived results . we start by analyzing a simplified two - level - atom model , and we then analyze a three - level - atom model that should describe accurately the recently realized superconducting artificial - atom laser .
