in this work we show that corrections to the newton 's second law appears if we assume that the phase space has a symplectic structure consistent with the rules of commutation of noncommutative quantum mechanis . in the central field case we find that the correction term breaks the rotational symmetry . in particular , for the kepler problem , this term takes the form of a coriolis force produced by the weak gravitational field far from a rotating massive object .
