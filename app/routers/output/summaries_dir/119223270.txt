we propose a simple physical implementation of the quantum householder reflection ( qhr ) m(v)=i-2|v><v| in a quantum system of n degenerate states ( forming a qunit ) coupled simultaneously to an ancillary ( excited ) state by n resonant or nearly resonant pulsed external fields . we also introduce the generalized qhr m(v;k)=i+(exp{ik}-1)|v><v| , which can be produced in the same n - pod system when the fields are appropriately detuned from resonance with the excited state . we use these two operators as building blocks in constructing arbitrary preselected unitary transformations . we show that the most general u(n ) transformation can be factorized ( and thereby produced ) by either n-1 standard qhrs and an n - dimensional phase gate , or n-1 generalized qhrs and a one - dimensional phase gate . viewed mathematically , these qhr factorizations provide parametrizations of the u(n ) group . as an example , we propose a recipe for constructing the quantum fourier transform ( qft ) by at most n interaction steps . for example , qft requires a single qhr for n=2 , and only two qhrs for n=3 and 4 .
