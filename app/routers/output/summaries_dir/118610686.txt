a constraint of vanishing energy - momentum tensor is motivated by a variety of perspectives on quantum gravity . we demonstrate in a concrete example how this constraint leads to a metric - independent theory in which quantum gravity emerges as a nonperturbative artifact of regularization - scale physics . we analyze a scalar theory similar to the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) theory with vanishing gauge fields , with the dbi lagrangian modulated by a scalar potential . in the limit of a large number of scalars , we explicitly demonstrate the existence of a composite massless spin-2 graviton in the spectrum that couples to matter as in einstein gravity . we comment on the cosmological constant problem and the generalization to theories with fermions and gauge fields .
