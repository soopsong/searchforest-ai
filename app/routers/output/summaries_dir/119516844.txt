the verification and quantification of experimentally created entanglement by simple measurements , especially between distant particles , is an important basic task in quantum processing . when composite systems are subjected to local measurements the measurement data will exhibit correlations , whether these systems are classical or quantum . therefore , the observation of correlations in the classical measurement record does not automatically imply the presence of quantum correlations in the system under investigation . in this work we explore the question of when correlations , or other measurement data , are sufficient to guarantee the existence of a certain amount of quantum correlations in the system and when additional information , such as the degree of purity of the system , is needed to do so . various measurement settings are discussed , both numerically and analytically . exact results and lower bounds on the least entanglement consistent with the observations are presented . the approach is suitable both for the bi - partite and the multi - partite setting .
