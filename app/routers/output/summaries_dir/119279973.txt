we propose a step towards a resolution to black hole information paradox by analyzing scattering amplitudes of a complex scalar field around a schwarzschild black hole . the scattering cross section reveals much information on the incoming state but exhibits flux loss at the same time . the flux loss should be temporary , and indicate mass growth of the black hole . the black hole should hawking - radiate subsequently , thereby , compensating for the flux loss . { by examining the purity issue } , we comment on the possibility that information bleaching may be the key to the paradox .
