we propose a feedback scheme for preparation of photon number states in a microwave cavity . quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurements of the cavity field and a control signal consisting of a microwave pulse injected into the cavity are used to drive the system towards a desired target photon number state . unlike previous work , we do not use the galerkin approximation of truncating the infinite - dimensional system hilbert space into a finite - dimensional subspace . we use an ( unbounded ) strict lyapunov function and prove that a feedback scheme that minimizes the expectation value of the lyapunov function at each time step stabilizes the system at the desired photon number state with ( a pre - specified ) arbitrarily high probability . simulations of this scheme demonstrate that we improve the performance of the controller by reducing"leakage"to high photon numbers .
