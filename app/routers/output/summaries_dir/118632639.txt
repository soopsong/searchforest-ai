efficient generation of cluster states is crucial for engineering large - scale measurement - based quantum computers . hybrid matter - optical systems offer a robust , scalable path to this goal . such systems have an ancilla which acts as a bus connecting the qubits . we show that by generating smaller cluster"lego bricks " , reusing one ancilla per brick , the cluster can be produced with maximal efficiency , requiring fewer than half the operations compared with no bus reuse . by reducing the time required to prepare sections of the cluster , bus reuse more than doubles the size of the computational workspace that can be used before decoherence effects dominate . a row of buses in parallel provides fully scalable cluster state generation requiring only 20 cphase gates per bus use .
