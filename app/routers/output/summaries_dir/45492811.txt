we propose a method to improve the performance of two - way continuous - variable quantum key distribution protocol by virtual photon subtraction . the virtual photon subtraction implemented via non - gaussian post - selection not only enhances the entanglement of two - mode squeezed vacuum state but also has advantages in simplifying physical operation and promoting efficiency . in two - way protocol , virtual photon subtraction could be applied on two sources independently . numerical simulations show that the optimal performance of renovated two - way protocol is obtained with photon subtraction only used by alice . the transmission distance and tolerable excess noise are improved by using the virtual photon subtraction with appropriate parameters . moreover , the tolerable excess noise maintains a high value with the increase of distance so that the robustness of two - way continuous - variable quantum key distribution system is significantly improved , especially at long transmission distance .
