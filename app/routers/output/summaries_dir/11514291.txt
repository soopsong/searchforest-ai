classes of performance measures expressed in terms of $ { \cal h}_2$-norms have been recently introduced to quantify the response of coupled dynamical systems to external perturbations . so far , investigations of these performance measures have been restricted to nodal perturbations . here , we go beyond these earlier works and consider the equally important , but so far neglected case of line perturbations . we consider a network - reduced power system , where a kron reduction has eliminated passive buses . identifying the effect that a line fault in the physical network has on the kron - reduced network , we find that performance measures depend on whether the faulted line connects two passive , two active buses or one active to one passive bus . in all cases , performance measures depend quadratically on the original load on the faulted line times a topology dependent factor . our theoretical formalism being restricted to dirac-$\delta$ perturbations , we investigate numerically the validity of our results for finite - time line faults . we find good agreement with theoretical predictions for longer fault durations in systems with more inertia .
