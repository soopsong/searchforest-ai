quantum interference of correlated particles is a fundamental quantum phenomenon which carries signatures of the statistics properties of the particles , such as bunching or anti - bunching . in presence of particular symmetries , interference effects take place with high visibility , one of the simplest cases being the suppression of coincident detection in the hong - ou - mandel effect . tichy et al . recently demonstrated a simple sufficient criterion for the suppression of output events in the more general case of fourier multi - port beam splitters . here we study the case in which $ 2^q$ particles ( either bosonic or fermionic ) are injected simultaneously in different ports of a sylvester interferometer with $ 2^p \geq 2^q$ modes . in particular , we prove a necessary and sufficient criterion for a significant fraction of output states to be suppressed , for specific input configurations . this may find application in assessing the indistinguishability of multiple single photon sources and in the validation of boson sampling machines .
