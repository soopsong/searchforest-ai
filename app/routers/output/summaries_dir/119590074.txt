equiangular tight frames are examples of grassmannian line packings for a hilbert space . more specifically , according to a bound by welch , they are minimizers for the maximal magnitude occurring among the inner products of all pairs of vectors in a unit - norm frame . this paper is dedicated to packings in the regime in which the number of frame vectors precludes the existence of equiangular frames . the orthoplex bound then serves as an alternative to infer a geometric structure of optimal designs . we construct frames of unit - norm vectors in $ k$-dimensional complex hilbert spaces that achieve the orthoplex bound . when $ k-1 $ is a prime power , we obtain a tight frame with $ k^2 + 1 $ vectors and when $ k$ is a prime power , with $ k^2+k-1 $ vectors . in addition , we show that these frames form weighted complex projective 2-designs that are useful additions to maximal equiangular tight frames and maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases in quantum state tomography . our construction is based on singer 's family of difference sets and the related concept of relative difference sets .
