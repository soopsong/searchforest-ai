we investigate capacitively coupled two - qubit quantum gates based on quantum dots . for exchange - only coded qubits electron spin $ s$ and its projection $ s_z$ are exact quantum numbers . capacitive coupling between qubits , as distinct from interqubit exchange , preserves these quantum numbers . we prove , both analytically and numerically , that conservation of the spins of individual qubits has dramatic effect on performance of two - qubit gates . by varying the level splittings of individual qubits , $ j_a$ and $ j_b$ , and the interqubit coupling time $ t$ , we can find an infinite number of triples $ ( j_a , j_b , t)$ for which the two - qubit entanglement , in combination with appropriate single - qubit rotations , can produce an exact cnot gate . this statement is true for practically arbitrary magnitude and form of capacitive interqubit coupling . our findings promise a large decrease in the number of nonlocal ( two - qubit ) operations in quantum circuits .
