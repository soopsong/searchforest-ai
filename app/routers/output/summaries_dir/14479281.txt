we present a protocol for performing entanglement connection between pairs of atomic ensembles in the single excitation regime . two pairs are prepared in an asynchronous fashion and then connected via a bell measurement . the resulting state of the two remaining ensembles is mapped to photonic modes and a reduced density matrix is then reconstructed . our observations confirm for the first time the creation of coherence between atomic systems that never interacted , a first step towards entanglement connection , a critical requirement for quantum networking and long distance quantum communications .
