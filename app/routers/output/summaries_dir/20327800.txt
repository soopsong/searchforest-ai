classical measurement strategies in many areas are approaching their maximum resolution and sensitivity levels , but these levels often still fall far short of the ultimate limits allowed by the laws of physics . to go further , strategies must be adopted that take into account the quantum nature of the probe particles and that optimize their quantum states for the desired application . here , we review some of these approaches , in which quantum entanglement , the orbital angular momentum of single photons , and quantum interferometry are used to produce optical measurements beyond the classical limit .
