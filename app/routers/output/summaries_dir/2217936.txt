we generalize grover 's unstructured quantum search algorithm to enable it to use an arbitrary starting superposition and an arbitrary unitary matrix simultaneously . we derive an exact formula for the probability of the generalized grover 's algorithm succeeding after n iterations . we show that the fully generalized formula reduces to the special cases considered by previous authors . we then use the generalized formula to determine the optimal strategy for using the unstructured quantum search algorithm . on average the optimal strategy is about 12 % better than the naive use of grover 's algorithm . the speedup obtained is not dramatic but it illustrates that a hybrid use of quantum computing and classical computing techniques can yield a performance that is better than either alone . we extend the analysis to the case of a society of k quantum searches acting in parallel . we derive an analytic formula that connects the degree of parallelism with the optimal strategy for k - parallel quantum search . we then derive the formula for the expected speed of k - parallel quantum search .
