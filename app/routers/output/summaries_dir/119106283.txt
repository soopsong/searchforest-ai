in large quantum systems multipartite entanglement can be found in many inequivalent classes under local operations and classical communication . preparing states of arbitrary size in different classes is important for performing a wide range of quantum protocols . w states , in particular , constitute a class with a variety of quantum networking protocols . however , all known schemes for preparing w states are probabilistic , with resource requirements increasing at least sub - exponentially . we propose a deterministic scheme for preparing w states that requires no prior entanglement and can be performed locally . we introduce an all - optical setup that can efficiently prepare w states of arbitrary size . our scheme advances the use of w states in real - world quantum networks and could be extended to other physical systems .
