the maximum amplitude of mechanical oscillators coupled to optical cavities are studied both analytically and numerically . the optical backaction on the resonator enables self - sustained oscillations whose limit cycle is set by the dynamic range of the cavity . the maximum attainable amplitude and the phonon generation quantum efficiency of the backaction process are studied for both unresolved and resolved cavities . quantum efficiencies far exceeding one are found in the resolved sideband regime where the amplitude is low . on the other hand the maximum amplitude is found in the unresolved system . finally , the role of mechanical nonlinearities is addressed .
