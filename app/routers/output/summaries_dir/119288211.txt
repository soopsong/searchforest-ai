we address extended systems interacting with classical fluctuating environments and analyze the use of quantum probes to discriminate local noise , described by independent fluctuating fields , from common noise , corresponding to the interaction with a common one . in particular , we consider a bipartite system made of two non interacting harmonic oscillators and assess discrimination strategies based on homodyne detection , comparing their performances with the ultimate bounds on the error probabilities of quantum - limited measurements . we analyze in details the use of gaussian probes , with emphasis on experimentally friendly signals . our results show that a joint measurement of the position - quadrature on the two oscillators outperforms any other homodyne - based scheme for any input gaussian state .
