we study the use of a pair of qubits as a decoherence probe of a non - trivial environment . this dual - probe configuration is modelled by three two - level - systems which are coupled in a chain in which the middle system represents an environmental two - level - system ( tls ) . this tls resides within the environment of the qubits and therefore its coupling to perturbing fluctuations ( i.e. its decoherence ) is assumed much stronger than the decoherence acting on the probe qubits . we study the evolution of such a tripartite system including the appearance of a decoherence - free state ( dark state ) and non - markovian behaviour . we find that all parameters of this tls can be obtained from measurements of one of the probe qubits . furthermore we show the advantages of two qubits in probing environments and the new dynamics imposed by a tls which couples to two qubits at once .
