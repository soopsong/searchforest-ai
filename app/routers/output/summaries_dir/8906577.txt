entanglement swapping at telecom wavelengths is at the heart of quantum networking in optical fiber infrastructures . although entanglement swapping has been demonstrated experimentally so far using various types of entangled photon sources both in near - infrared and telecom wavelength regions , the rate of swapping operation has been too low to be applied to practical quantum protocols , due to limited efficiency of entangled photon sources and photon detectors . here we demonstrate drastic improvement of the efficiency at telecom wavelength by using two ultra - bright entangled photon sources and four highly efficient superconducting nanowire single photon detectors.we have attained a four - fold coincidence count rate of 108 counts per second , which is three orders higher than the previous experiments at telecom wavelengths . a raw ( net ) visibility in a hong - ou - mandel interference between the two independent entangled sources was 73.3 $ \pm$ 1.0 % ( 85.1 $ \pm$ 0.8 % ) . we performed the teleportation and entanglement swapping , and obtained a fidelity of 76.3 % in the swapping test.our results on the coincidence count rates are comparable with the ones ever recorded in teleportation / swaping and multi - photon entanglement generation experiments at around 800\,nm wavelengths . our setup opens the way to practical implementation of device - independent quantum key distribution and its distance extension by the entanglement swapping as well as multi - photon entangled state generation in telecom band infrastructures with both space and fiber links .
