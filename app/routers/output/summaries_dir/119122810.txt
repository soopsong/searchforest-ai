hawking showed that the radiation emitted from a classical collapsing shell is thermal . here , we show that a semiclassical collapsing shell emits radiation that is only approximately thermal , with small but significant deviations . the most important difference is the presence of small off - diagonal elements in the radiation density matrix with a magnitude of order $ 1/\sqrt{s_{bh}}$ , $ s_{bh}$ being the bekenstein - hawking entropy of the incipient black hole . the off - diagonal elements store the correlations between the collapsing shell and the emitted radiation and allow information to continuously leak from the collapsed body . the rate of escape of information is initially very small , increasing to order one by the page time , when the black hole has lost half its original entropy . we show that , until the page time , the radiation is almost exactly thermal and that , from this time on , it begins to purify at an increasing rate .
