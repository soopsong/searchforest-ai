topological insulators have inspired the study with various quantum simulators . exploiting the tunability of the qubit frequency and qubit - qubit coupling , we show that a superconducting qubit chain can simulate various topological band models . when the system is restricted to the single - spin excitation subspace , the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model can be equivalently simulated by alternating the coupling strength between neighboring qubits . the existence of topological edge states in this qubit chain is demonstrated in the quench dynamics after the first qubit is excited . this excitation propagates along the chain where the qubit - qubit coupling is homogeneous . in contrast , in our qubit chain , the spin - up state localizes at the first qubit and the rest qubits remain in the spin - down state . we further show that the spin - up state can be transported along the chain by modulating the coupling strengths and the qubit frequencies . this demonstrates adiabatic pumping based on the rice - mele model . moreover , we also discuss possible ways to construct other topological models with different topological phenomena within the current technology of superconducting qubits .
