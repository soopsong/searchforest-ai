we present a general argument showing that the temperature as well as other thermodynamical state variables can qualify as entanglement witnesses for spatial entanglement . this holds for a variety of systems and we exemplify our ideas using a simple free non - interacting bosonic gas . we find that entanglement can exist at arbitrarily high temperatures , provided that we can probe smaller and smaller regions of space . we then discuss the relationship between the occurrence of bose - einstein condensation and our conditions for the presence of entanglement and compare the respective critical temperatures . we close with a short discussion of the idea of seeing entanglement as a macroscopic property in thermodynamical systems and its possible relation to phase transitions in general .
