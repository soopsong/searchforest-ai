the back reactions of hawking radiation allow nontrivial correlations between consecutive hawking quanta , which gives a possible way of resolving the paradox of black hole information loss known as the hidden messenger method . in a recent work of ma { \it et al } [ arxiv:1711.10704 ] , this method is enhanced by a general derivation using small deviations of the states of hawking quanta off canonical typicality . in this paper , we use this typicality argument to study the effects of generic back reactions on the quantum geometries described by spin network states , and discuss the viability of entropy conservation in loop quantum gravity . we find that such back reactions lead to small area deformations of quantum geometries including those of quantum black holes . this shows that the hidden - messenger method is still viable in loop quantum gravity , which is a first step towards resolving the paradox of black hole information loss in quantum gravity .
