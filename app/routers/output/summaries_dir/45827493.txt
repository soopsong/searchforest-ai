we suggest a realization of a bistable non - volatile memory capacitor ( memcapacitor ) . its design utilizes a strained elastic membrane as a plate of a parallel - plate capacitor . the applied stress generates low and high capacitance configurations of the system . we demonstrate that a voltage pulse of an appropriate amplitude can be used to reliably switch the memcapacitor into the desired capacitance state . moreover , charged - voltage and capacitance - voltage curves of such a system demonstrate hysteresis and transition into a chaotic regime in a certain range of ac voltage amplitudes and frequencies . membrane memcapacitor connected to a voltage source comprises a single element nonautonomous chaotic circuit .
