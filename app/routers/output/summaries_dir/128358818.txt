designing and implementing algorithms for medium and large scale quantum computers is not easy . in previous work we have suggested , and developed , the idea of using machine learning techniques to train a quantum system such that the desired process is"learned,"thus obviating the algorithm design difficulty . this works quite well for small systems . but the goal is macroscopic physical computation . here , we implement our learned pairwise entanglement witness on microsoft 's q # , one of the commercially available gate model quantum computer simulators ; we perform statistical analysis to determine reliability and reproduceability ; and we show that using the machine learning technique called"bootstrapping " , we can infer the pattern for mesoscopic n from simulation results for three- , four- , five- , six- , and seven - qubit systems . our results suggest a fruitful pathway for general quantum computer algorithm design and computation .
