a line of work initiated by terhal and divincenzo and bremner , jozsa , and shepherd , shows that quantum computers can efficiently sample from probability distributions that can not be exactly sampled efficiently on a classical computer , unless the ph collapses . aaronson and arkhipov take this further by considering a distribution that can be sampled efficiently by linear optical quantum computation , that under two feasible conjectures , can not even be approximately sampled classically within bounded total variation distance , unless the ph collapses . in this work we use quantum fourier sampling to construct a class of distributions that can be sampled by a quantum computer . we then argue that these distributions can not be approximately sampled classically , unless the ph collapses , under variants of the aaronson and arkhipov conjectures . in particular , we show a general class of quantumly sampleable distributions each of which is based on an"efficiently specifiable"polynomial , for which a classical approximate sampler implies an average - case approximation . this class of polynomials contains the permanent but also includes , for example , the hamiltonian cycle polynomial , and many other familiar # p - hard polynomials . although our construction , unlike that proposed by aaronson and arkhipov , likely requires a universal quantum computer , we are able to use this additional power to weaken the conjectures needed to prove approximate sampling hardness results .
