blind quantum computation ( bqc ) allows that a client who has limited quantum abilities can delegate quantum computation to a server who has advanced quantum technologies but learns nothing about the client 's private information . for example , measurement - based model can guarantee privacy of client 's inputs , quantum algorithms and outputs . however , it still remains a challenge to directly encrypt quantum algorithms in circuits model . to solve the problem , we propose gtubqc , the first gate teleportation - based universal bqc protocol . specifically , in this paper we consider a scenario where there are a trusted center responsible for preparing initial states , a client with the ability to perform x , z , and two non - communicating servers conducting ubqc ( universal bqc ) and bell measurements . gtubqc ensures that all quantum outputs are at the client 's side and the client only needs to detect whether servers honestly return correct measurement outcomes or not . in particular , gtubqc can hide the universal quantum gates by encrypting the rotation angles , because arbitrary unitary operation can be decomposed into a combination of arbitrary rotation operators . also , gtubqc protocol can facilitate realizing ubqc in circuits , since gtubqc uses one - time - pad to guarantee blindness . we prove the blindness and correctness of gtubqc , and apply our approach to other types of computational tasks , such as quantum fourier transform .
