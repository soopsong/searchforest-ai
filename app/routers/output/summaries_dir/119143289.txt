we construct concrete examples of time operators for both continuous and discrete - time homogeneous quantum walks , and we determine their deficiency indices and spectra . for a discrete - time quantum walk , the time operator can be self - adjoint if the time evolution operator has a non - zero winding number . in this case , its spectrum becomes a discrete set of real numbers .
