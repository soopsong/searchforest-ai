we investigate how to describe the dissipative spin dynamics of the driven - dissipative dicke model , describing $ n$ two - level atoms coupled to a cavity mode , after adiabatic elimination of the cavity mode . to this end , we derive a redfield master equation which goes beyond the standard secular approximation and large detuning limits . we show that the secular ( or rotating wave ) approximation and the large detuning approximation both lead to inadequate master equations , that fail to predict the dicke transition or the damping rates of the atomic dynamics . in contrast , the full redfield theory correctly predicts the phase transition and the effective atomic damping rates . our work provides a reliable framework to study the full quantum dynamics of atoms in a multimode cavity , where a quantum description of the full model becomes intractable .
