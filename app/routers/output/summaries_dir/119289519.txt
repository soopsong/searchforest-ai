we study the large $ n$ dynamics of the $ o(n)$ field theory in the thermo field dynamics approach . the question of recovering the high temperature phase and the corresponding $ o(n)$ gauging is clarified . through the associated bi - local representation we discuss the emergent bulk space - time and construction of ( higher spin ) fields . we note the presence of ` evanescent ' modes in this construction and also the mixing of spins at finite temperature .
