we construct optimal protocols for verifying both qubit and qudit ghz states using local projective measurements . when the local dimension is a prime , an optimal protocol is constructed from pauli measurements only . our protocols provide a highly efficient way for estimating the fidelity and certifying genuine multipartite entanglement . in particular , they enable the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement using only one test when the local dimension is sufficiently large . by virtue of adaptive local projective measurements , we then construct protocols for verifying ghz - like states that are optimal over all protocols based on one - way communication . the efficiency can be improved further if additional communications are allowed . finally , we construct optimal protocols for verifying ghz states and nearly optimal protocols for ghz - like states in the adversarial scenario .
