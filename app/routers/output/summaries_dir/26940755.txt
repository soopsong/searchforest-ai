we report operation and characterization of a lab - assembled single - photon detector based on commercial silicon avalanche photodiodes ( perkinelmer c30902sh , c30921sh ) . dark count rate as low as 5 hz was achieved by cooling the photodiodes down to -80 c. while afterpulsing increased as the photodiode temperature was decreased , total afterpulse probability did not become significant due to detector 's relatively long deadtime in a passively - quenched scheme . we measured photon detection efficiency higher than 50 % at 806 nm .
