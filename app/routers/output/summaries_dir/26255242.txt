we show that any decoherence functional $ d$ can be represented by a spanning vector - valued measure on a complex hilbert space . moreover , this representation is unique up to an isomorphism when the system is finite . we consider the natural map $ u$ from the history hilbert space $ k$ to the standard hilbert space $ h$ of the usual quantum formulation . we show that $ u$ is an isomorphism from $ k$ onto a closed subspace of $ h$ and that $ u$ is an isomorphism from $ k$ onto $ h$ if and only if the representation is spanning . we then apply this work to show that a quantum measure has a hilbert space representation if and only if it is strongly positive . we also discuss classical decoherence functionals , operator - valued measures and quantum operator measures .
