we propose relative entropy - based quantifiers for genuine multipartite total , quantum , and classical correlations . these correlation measures are applied to investigate the generation of genuine multiparticle correlations in decoherent dynamics induced by the interaction of two qubits with local- independent environments . we consider amplitude- and phase - damping channels and compare their capabilities to spread information through the creation of many - body correlations . we identify changes in behavior for the genuine four- and three - partite total correlations and show that , contrary to amplitude environments , phase - noise channels transform the bipartite correlation initially shared between the qubits into genuine multiparticle system - environment correlations .
