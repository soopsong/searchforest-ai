time periodic driving serves not only as a convenient way to engineer effective hamiltonians , but also as a means to produce intrinsically dynamical phases that do not exist in the static limit . a recent example of the latter are 2d chiral floquet ( cf ) phases exhibiting anomalous edge dynamics that pump discrete packets of quantum information along one direction . in non - fractionalized systems with only bosonic excitations , this pumping is quantified by a dynamical topological index that is a rational number -- highlighting its difference from the integer valued invariant underlying equilibrium chiral phases ( e.g. quantum hall systems ) . here , we explore cf phases in systems with emergent anyon excitations that have fractional statistics ( abelian topological order ) . despite the absence of mobile non - abelian particles in these systems , external driving can supply the energy to pump otherwise immobile non - abelian defects ( sometimes called twist defects or genons ) around the boundary , thereby transporting an irrational fractional number of quantum bits along the edge during each drive period . this enables new cf phases with chiral indices that are square roots of rational numbers , inspiring the label:"radical cf phases " . we demonstrate an unexpected bulk - boundary correspondence , in which the radical cf edge is tied to bulk dynamics that exchange electric and magnetic anyon excitations during each period . we construct solvable , stroboscopically driven versions of kitaev 's honeycomb spin model that realize these radical cf phases , and discuss their stability against heating in strongly disordered many - body localized settings or in the limit of rapid driving as an exponentially long - lived pre - thermal phenomena .
