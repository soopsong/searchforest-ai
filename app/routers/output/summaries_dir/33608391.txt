in this paper , we develop a direct method for the characterization of dark modes . the results can be used to construct a transformation that separates dark and bright modes , through the decomposition of system dynamics . we also study a synthesis problem by engineering the system - environment coupling and hamiltonian engineering . we apply the theory to investigate an optomechanical dark mode .
