we demonstrate , theoretically and experimentally , that statistical mixtures of the vacuum state |0 > and the single - photon fock state |1 > are nonclassical according to the vogel criterion ( w. vogel , phys . rev . lett . 84 , 1849 ( 2000 ) ) , regardless of the vacuum fraction . the ensembles are synthesized via conditional measurements on biphotons generated by means of parametric downconversion , and their quadrature statistics are measured using balanced homodyne detection . a comparative review of various quantum state nonclassicality criteria is presented .
