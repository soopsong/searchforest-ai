circulant matrices are an important family of operators , which have a wide range of applications in science and engineering related fields . they are in general non - sparse and non - unitary . in this paper , we present efficient quantum circuits to implement circulant operators using fewer resources and with lower complexity than existing methods . moreover , our quantum circuits can be readily extended to the implementation of toeplitz , hankel , and block circulant matrices . efficient quantum algorithms to implement the inverses and products of circulant operators are also provided .
