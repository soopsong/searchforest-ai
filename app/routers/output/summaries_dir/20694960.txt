we consider a classical and possibly driven composite system $ x \otimes y$ weakly coupled to a markovian thermal reservoir $ r$ so that an unambiguous stochastic thermodynamics ensues for $ x \otimes y$. this setup can be equivalently seen as a system $ x$ strongly coupled to a non - markovian reservoir $ y \otimes r$. we demonstrate that only in the limit where the dynamics of $ y$ is much faster then $ x$ , our unambiguous expressions for thermodynamic quantities such as heat , entropy or internal energy , are equivalent to the strong coupling expressions recently obtained in the literature using the hamiltonian of mean force . by doing so , we also significantly extend these results by formulating them at the level of instantaneous rates and by allowing for time - dependent couplings between $ x$ and its environment . away from the limit where $ y$ evolves much faster than $ x$ , previous approaches fail to reproduce the correct results from the original unambiguous formulation , as we illustrate numerically for an underdamped brownian particle coupled strongly to a non - markovian reservoir .
