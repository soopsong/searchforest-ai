we present a reliable algorithm to evaluate quantum discord for general two -- qubit states , amending and extending an approach recently put forward for the subclass of x -- states . a closed expression for the discord of arbitrary states of two qubits can not be obtained , as the optimization problem for the conditional entropy requires the solution to a pair of transcendental equations in the state parameters . we apply our algorithm to run a numerical comparison between quantum discord and an alternative , computable measure of non - classical correlations , namely the geometric discord . we identify the extremally non - classically correlated two -- qubit states according to the ( normalized ) geometric discord , at fixed value of the conventional quantum discord . the latter can not exceed the square root of the former for systems of two qubits .
