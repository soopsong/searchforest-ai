quantum amplifier channels are at the core of several physical processes . not only do they model the optical process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion , but the transformation corresponding to an amplifier channel also describes the physics of the dynamical casimir effect in superconducting circuits , the unruh effect , and hawking radiation . here we study the communication capabilities of quantum amplifier channels . invoking a recently established minimum output - entropy theorem for single - mode phase - insensitive gaussian channels , we determine capacities of quantum - limited amplifier channels in three different scenarios . first , we establish the capacities of quantum - limited amplifier channels for one of the most general communication tasks , characterized by the trade - off between classical communication , quantum communication , and entanglement generation or consumption . second , we establish capacities of quantum - limited amplifier channels for the trade - off between public classical communication , private classical communication , and secret key generation . third , we determine the capacity region for a broadcast channel induced by the quantum - limited amplifier channel , and we also show that a fully quantum strategy outperforms those achieved by classical coherent detection strategies . in all three scenarios , we find that the capacities significantly outperform communication rates achieved with a naive time - sharing strategy .
