in ion traps , entangling gate operations can be realized by a bichromatic pair of laser beams that collectively interact with the ions . in this paper , a new method of modelling the laser - ion interaction is introduced that turns out to be superior to standard techniques for the description of gate operations on optical qubits . the treatment allows for a comparison of the performance of gates based on $ \sigma_z\otimes\sigma_z$ and m{\o}lmer - s{\o}rensen interactions on optical transitions where the bichromatic laser field can be realized by an amplitude - modulated laser resonant with the qubit transition . shaping the amplitude of the bichromatic laser pulse is shown to make the gates more robust against experimental imperfections .
