recently , two - photon six - qubit hyperentangled states were produced in experiment and they can improve the channel capacity of quantum communication largely . here we present a scheme for the hyperentanglement purification of nonlocal two - photon systems in three degrees of freedom ( dofs ) , including the polarization , the first - longitudinal - momentum , and the second longitudinal momentum dofs . our hyperentanglement purification protocol ( hyper - epp ) is constructed with two steps resorting to parity - check quantum nondemolition measurement on the three dofs and swap gates , respectively . with these two steps , the bit - flip errors in the three dofs can be corrected efficiently . also , we show that using swap gates is a universal method for hyper - epp in the polarization dof and multiple longitudinal momentum dofs . the implementation of our hyper - epp is assisted by nitrogen - vacancy centers in optical microcavities , which could be achieved with current techniques . it is useful for long - distance high - capacity quantum communication with two - photon six - qubit hyperentanglement .
