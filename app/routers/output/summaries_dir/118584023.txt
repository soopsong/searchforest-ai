quantum squeezing and entanglement of spins can be used to improve the sensitivity in quantum metrology . here we propose a scheme to create collective coupling of an ensemble of spins to mechanical vibrational mode actuated by an external magnetic field . we find an evolution time where the mechanical motion decouples from the spins , and the accumulated geometric phase yields a squeezing of $ 5.9~\text{db}$ for $ 20 $ spins . we also show the creation of a greenberger - horne - zeilinger spin state for $ 20 $ spins with a fidelity of $ \sim 0.62 $ at cryogenic temperature . the numerical simulations show that the geometric - phase based scheme is mostly immune to thermal mechanical noise .
