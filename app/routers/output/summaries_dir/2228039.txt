we present squeezing and anti - squeezing spectra of the output from a degenerate optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) network arranged in different coherent quantum feedback configurations . one opo serves as a quantum plant , the other as a quantum controller . the addition of coherent feedback enables shaping of the output squeezing spectrum of the plant , and is found to be capable of pushing the frequency of maximum squeezing away from the optical driving frequency and broadening the spectrum over a wider frequency band . the experimental results are in excellent agreement with the developed theory , and illustrate the use of coherent quantum feedback to engineer the quantum - optical properties of the plant opo output .
