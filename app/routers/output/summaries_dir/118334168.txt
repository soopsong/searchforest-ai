we consider how to characterize the dynamics of a quantum system from a restricted set of initial states and measurements using bayesian analysis . previous work has shown that hamiltonian systems can be well estimated from analysis of noisy data . here we show how to generalize this approach to systems with moderate dephasing in the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian . we illustrate the process for a range of three - level quantum systems . the results suggest that the bayesian estimation of the frequencies and dephasing rates is generally highly accurate and the main source of errors are errors in the reconstructed hamiltonian basis .
