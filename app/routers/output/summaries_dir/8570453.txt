the basic methods of constructing the sets of mutually unbiased bases in the hilbert space of an arbitrary finite dimension are discussed and an emerging link between them is outlined . it is shown that these methods employ a wide range of important mathematical concepts like , e.g. , fourier transforms , galois fields and rings , finite and related projective geometries , and entanglement , to mention a few . some applications of the theory to quantum information tasks are also mentioned .
