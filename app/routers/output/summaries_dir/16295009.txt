we establish a theory of quantum - to - classical rate distortion coding . in this setting , a sender alice has many copies of a quantum information source . her goal is to transmit classical information about the source , obtained by performing a measurement on it , to a receiver bob , up to some specified level of distortion . we derive a single - letter formula for the minimum rate of classical communication needed for this task . we also evaluate this rate in the case in which bob has some quantum side information about the source . our results imply that , in general , alice 's best strategy is a non - classical one , in which she performs a collective measurement on successive outputs of the source .
