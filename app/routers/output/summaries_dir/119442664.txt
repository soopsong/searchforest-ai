achieving cavity - optomechanical strong coupling with high - frequency phonons provides a rich avenue for quantum technology development including quantum state - transfer , memory , and transduction , as well as enabling several fundamental studies of macroscopic phononic degrees - of - freedom . reaching such coupling with ghz mechanical modes however has proved challenging , with a prominent hindrance being material- and surface - induced - optical absorption in many materials . here , we circumvent these challenges and report the observation of optomechanical strong coupling to a high frequency ( 11 ghz ) mechanical mode of a fused - silica whispering - gallery microresonator via the electrostrictive brillouin interaction . using an optical heterodyne detection scheme , the anti - stokes light backscattered from the resonator is measured and normal - mode splitting and an avoided crossing are observed in the recorded spectra , providing unambiguous signatures of strong coupling . the optomechanical coupling rate reaches values as high as $ g/2\pi = 39 \ \text{mhz}$ through the use of an auxiliary pump resonance , where the coupling dominates both the optical ( $ \kappa/2\pi = 3 \ \text{mhz}$ ) and the mechanical ( $ \gamma_\text{m}/2\pi = 21 \ \text{mhz}$ ) amplitude decay rates . our findings provide a promising new approach for optical quantum control using light and sound .
