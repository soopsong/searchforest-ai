the ability of fully reconstructing quantum maps is a fundamental task of quantum information , in particular when coupling with the environment and experimental imperfections of devices are taken into account . in this context we carry out a quantum process tomography ( qpt ) approach for a set of non trace - preserving maps . we introduce an operator $ \oo$ to characterize the state dependent probability of success for the process under investigation . we also evaluate the result of approximating the process with a trace - preserving one .
