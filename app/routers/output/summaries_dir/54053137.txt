we discuss the emergence of spontaneous synchronization for an open spin - pair system interacting only via a common environment . under suitable conditions , and even in the presence of detuning between the natural precession frequencies of the two spins , they are shown to reach a long - lasting transient behavior where they oscillate in phase . we explore the connection between the emergence of such a behavior and the establishment of robust quantum correlations between the two spins , analyzing differences between dissipative and dephasing effects .
