even if the output of a random number generator ( rng ) is perfectly uniformly distributed , it may be correlated to pre - existing information and therefore be predictable . statistical tests are thus not sufficient to guarantee that an rng is usable for applications , e.g. , in cryptography or gambling , where unpredictability is important . to enable such applications a stronger notion of randomness , termed"true randomness " , is required , which includes independence from prior information . quantum systems are particularly suitable for true randomness generation , as their unpredictability can be proved based on physical principles . practical implementations of quantum rngs ( qrngs ) are however always subject to noise , i.e. , influences which are not fully controlled . this reduces the quality of the raw randomness generated by the device , making it necessary to post - process it . here we provide a framework to analyse realistic qrngs and to determine the post - processing that is necessary to turn their raw output into true randomness .
