adiabatic state engineering is a powerful technique in quantum information and quantum control . however , its performance is limited by the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics . in this scenario , shortcuts to adiabaticity , such as provided by the superadiabatic theory , constitute a valuable tool to speed up the adiabatic quantum behavior . here , we propose a superadiabatic route to implement universal quantum computation . our method is based on the realization of piecewise controlled superadiabatic evolutions . remarkably , they can be obtained by simple time - independent counter - diabatic hamiltonians . in particular , we discuss the implementation of fast rotation gates and arbitrary n - qubit controlled gates , which can be used to design different sets of universal quantum gates . concerning the energy cost of the superadiabatic implementation , we show that it is dictated by the quantum speed limit , providing an upper bound for the corresponding adiabatic counterparts .
