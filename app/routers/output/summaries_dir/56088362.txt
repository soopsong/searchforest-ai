average entanglement of random pure states of an n x n composite system is analyzed . we compute the average value of the determinant d of the reduced state , which forms an entanglement monotone . calculating higher moments of the determinant we characterize the probability distribution p(d ) . similar results are obtained for the rescaled n - th root of the determinant , called g - concurrence . we show that in the limit $ n\to\infty$ this quantity becomes concentrated at a single point g=1 / e . the position of the concentration point changes if one consider an arbitrary n x k bipartite system , in the joint limit $ n , k\to\infty$ , k / n fixed .
