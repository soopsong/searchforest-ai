we improve the upper bound on the minimal resources required for measurement - based quantum computation . minimizing the resources required for this model is a key issue for experimental realization of a quantum computer based on projective measurements . this new upper bound allows also to reply in the negative to the open question about the existence of a trade - off between observable and ancillary qubits in measurement - based quantum computation .
