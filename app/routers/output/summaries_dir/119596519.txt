discrete - time quantum walk evolve by a unitary operator which involves two operators a conditional shift in position space and a coin operator . this operator entangles the coin and position degrees of freedom of the walker . in this paper , we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the coin position entanglement ( cpe ) for an inhomogeneous quantum walk which determined by two orthogonal matrices in one - dimensional lattice . free parameters of coin operator together provide many conditions under which a measurement perform on the coin state yield the value of entanglement on the resulting position quantum state . we study the problem analytically for all values that two free parameters of coin operator can take and the conditions under which entanglement becomes maximal are sought .
