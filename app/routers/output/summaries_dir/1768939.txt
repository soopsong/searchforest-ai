we pose the question whether the asymptotic equivalence between quantum cloning and quantum state estimation , valid at single - copy level , still holds when all the copies are examined jointly . for an n - to - m cloner , we consider the overall fidelity between the state of the m output systems and the state of m ideal copies , and we ask whether the optimal fidelity is attained by a measure - and- prepare protocol in the limit of large m. in order to gain intuition into the general problem , we analyze two concrete examples : i ) cloning qubit states on the equator of the bloch sphere and ii ) cloning two - qubit maximally entangled states . in the first case , we show that the optimal measure - and- prepare fidelity converges to the fidelity of the optimal cloner in the limit of large m. in the second case , we restrict our attention to economical covariant cloners , and again , we exhibit a measure- and - prepare protocol that achieves asymptotically the optimal fidelity . quite counterintuitively , in both cases the optimal states that have to be prepared in order to maximize the overall fidelity are not product states corresponding to m identical copies , but instead suitable m - partite entangled states : the simple protocol where one estimates the input state and re - prepares m identical copies of the estimated state is strictly suboptimal , even in the asymptotic limit .
