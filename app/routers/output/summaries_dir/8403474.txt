the concept of non - markovianity ( nm ) in quantum dynamics is still an open debate . understanding how to generate and measure nm in specific models may aid in this quest . in quantum optics , an engineered electromagnetic environment coupled to a single atom can induce nm . the most common scenario of structured electromagnetic environment is an optical cavity , composed by a pair of mirrors . here , we show how to generate and measure nm on a two - level system coupled to a one - dimensional waveguide with no mirrors required . the origin of the non - markovian behavior lies in the initial state of the field , prepared as a single - photon packet . we analyze how nm depends on two experimentally controllable parameters , namely , the linewidth of the packet and its central frequency . we relate the presence of nm to a $ \pi$-phase shift between incoming and emitted fields . we also show how the two output channels of the waveguide provide distinct signatures of nm , both experimentally accessible .
