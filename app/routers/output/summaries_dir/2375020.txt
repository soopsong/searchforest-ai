network coding is a technique to maximize communication rates within a network , in communication protocols for simultaneous multi - party transmission of information . linear network codes are examples of such protocols in which the local computations performed at the nodes in the network are limited to linear transformations of their input data ( represented as elements of a ring , such as the integers modulo 2 ) . the quantum linear network coding protocols of kobayashi et al [ arxiv:0908.1457 and arxiv:1012.4583 ] coherently simulate classical linear network codes , using supplemental classical communication . we demonstrate that these protocols correspond in a natural way to measurement - based quantum computations with graph states over over qudits [ arxiv : quant - ph/0301052 , arxiv : quant - ph/0603226 , and arxiv:0704.1263 ] having a structure directly related to the network .
