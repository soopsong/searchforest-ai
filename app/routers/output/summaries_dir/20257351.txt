this paper is concerned with a linear fractional representation approach to the synthesis of linear coherent quantum controllers for a given linear quantum plant . the plant and controller represent open quantum harmonic oscillators and are modelled by linear quantum stochastic differential equations . the feedback interconnections between the plant and the controller are assumed to be established through quantum bosonic fields . in this framework , conditions for the stabilization of a given linear quantum plant via linear coherent quantum feedback are addressed using a stable factorization approach . the class of all stabilizing quantum controllers is parameterized in the frequency domain . coherent quantum weighted h_2 and h_\infty control problems for linear quantum systems are formulated in the frequency domain . finally , a projected gradient descent scheme is outlined for the coherent quantum weighted h_2 control problem .
