surface codes can protect quantum information stored in qubits from local errors as long as the per - operation error rate is below a certain threshold . here we propose holonomic surface codes by harnessing the quantum holonomy of the system . in our scheme , the holonomic gates are built via auxiliary qubits rather than the auxiliary levels in multilevel systems used in conventional holonomic quantum computation . the key advantage of our approach is that the auxiliary qubits are in their ground state before and after each gate operation , so they are not involved in the operation cycles of surface codes . this provides an advantageous way to implement surface codes for fault - tolerant quantum computation .
