several problems in modeling and control of stochastically - driven dynamical systems can be cast as regularized semi - definite programs . we examine two such representative problems and show that they can be formulated in a similar manner . the first , in statistical modeling , seeks to reconcile observed statistics by suitably and minimally perturbing prior dynamics . the second seeks to optimally select a subset of available sensors and actuators for control purposes . to address modeling and control of large - scale systems we develop a unified algorithmic framework using proximal methods . our customized algorithms exploit problem structure and allow handling statistical modeling , as well as sensor and actuator selection , for substantially larger scales than what is amenable to current general - purpose solvers . we establish linear convergence of the proximal gradient algorithm , draw contrast between the proposed proximal algorithms and alternating direction method of multipliers , and provide examples that illustrate the merits and effectiveness of our framework .
