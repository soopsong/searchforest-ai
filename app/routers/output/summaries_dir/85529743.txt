green - horne - zeilinger states are a typical type of multipartite entangled states , which plays a central role in quantum information processing . for the generation of multipartite entangled states , the single - step method is more preferable as the needed time will not increase with the increasing of the qubit number . however , this scenario has a strict requirement that all the two - qubit interaction strengths should be the same , or the generated state will be of low quality . here , we propose a scheme for generating multipartite entangled states of superconducting qubits , from a coupled circuit cavities scenario , where we rigorously achieve the requirement via adding an extra z - direction ac classical field for each qubit , leading the individual qubit - cavity coupling strength to be tunable in a wide range , and thus can be tuned to the same value . meanwhile , in order to obtain our wanted multi - qubits interaction , x - direction ac classical field for each qubit is also introduced . by selecting the appropriate parameters , we numerically shown that high - fidelity multi - qubit ghz states can be generated . in addition , we also show that the coupled cavities scenario is better than a single cavity case . therefore , our proposal represents a promising alternative for multipartite entangled states generation .
