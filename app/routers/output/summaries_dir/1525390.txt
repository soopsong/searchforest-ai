this paper considers a class of uncertain linear quantum systems subject to uncertain perturbations in the system hamiltonian . we present a method to design a coherent robust h - infinity controller so that the closed loop system is robustly stable and achieves a prescribed level of disturbance attenuation with all the admissible uncertainties . an illustrative example shows that for the given system , the method presented in this paper has improved performance over the existing quantum h - infinity control results without considering uncertainty .
