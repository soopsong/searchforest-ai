the fermi - hubbard model is one of the key models of condensed matter physics , which holds a potential for explaining the mystery of high - temperature superconductivity . recent progress in ultracold atoms in optical lattices has paved the way to studying the model 's phase diagram using the tools of quantum simulation , which emerged as a promising alternative to the numerical calculations plagued by the infamous sign problem . however , the temperatures achieved using elaborate laser cooling protocols so far have been too high to show the appearance of antiferromagnetic and superconducting quantum phases directly . in this work , we demonstrate that using the machinery of dissipative quantum state engineering , one can efficiently prepare antiferromagnetic order in present - day experiments with ultracold fermions . the core of the approach is to add incoherent laser scattering in such a way that the antiferromagnetic state emerges as the dark state of the driven - dissipative dynamics . in order to elucidate the development of the antiferromagnetic order we employ two complementary techniques : monte carlo wave function simulations for small systems and a recently proposed variational method for open quantum systems , operating in the thermodynamic limit . the controlled dissipation channels described in this work are straightforward to add to already existing experimental setups .
