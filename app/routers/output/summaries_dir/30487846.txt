we analyze the effect of phase fluctuations in an optical communication scheme based on collective detection of sequences of binary coherent state symbols using linear optics and photon counting . when the phase noise is absent , the scheme offers qualitatively improved nonlinear scaling of the spectral efficiency with the mean photon number in the low - power regime compared to individual detection . we show that this feature , providing a demonstration of superaddivitity of accessible information in classical communication over quantum channels , is preserved if random phases imprinted on transmitted symbols fluctuate around a reference fixed over the sequence length .
