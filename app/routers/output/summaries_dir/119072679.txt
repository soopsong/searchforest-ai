we theoretically study radiation pressure induced generation of the frequency components at the sum sideband in an optomechanical system containing an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) . it is shown that an opa inside a cavity can considerably enhance the amplitude of sum sideband even with low power input fields . we find a new matching condition for the upper sum sideband generation . the height and width of the new peak can be adjusted by the nonlinear gain of the opa . furthermore , the lower sum sideband generation can be enhanced with several orders of magnitude by tuning the nonlinear gain parameter and the phase of the field pumping the opa . the enhanced sum sideband may have potential applications to the manipulation of light in a on - chip optomechanical device and the sensitively sensing for precision measurement in the weak optomechanical coupling regime .
