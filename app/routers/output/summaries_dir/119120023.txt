tomography has reached its practical limits in characterization of new quantum devices , and there is a need for a new means of characterizing and validating new technological advances in this field . we propose a different verification scheme based on compiled versions of shor 's factoring algorithm that may be extended to large circuits in the future . the general version shor 's algorithm has been experimentally elusive due to bottlenecks associated with the modular exponentiation operation . experiments to date have only been able to execute compiled versions of the latter operation . we provide some new compiled circuits for experimentalists to use in the near future . we also demonstrate that an additional layer of compilation can be added using classical operations , that will reduce the number of qubits and gates needed in a given compiled circuit .
