we experimentally investigate a double - pass parametric down - conversion scheme for producing pulsed , polarization - entangled photon pairs with high visibility . the amplitudes for creating photon pairs on each pass interfere to compensate for distinguishing characteristics that normally degrade two - photon visibility . the result is a high - flux source of polarization - entangled photon pulses that does not require spectral filtering . we observe quantum interference visibility of over 95 % without the use of spectral filters for 200 femtosecond pulses , and up to 98.1 % with 5 nm bandwidth filters .
