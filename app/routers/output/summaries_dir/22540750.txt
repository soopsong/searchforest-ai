the realization of transfer functions of linear quantum stochastic systems ( lqsss ) is an issue of fundamental importance for the practical applications of such systems , especially as coherent controllers for other quantum systems . in this paper , we review two realization methods proposed by the authors in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] . the first one uses a cascade of a static linear quantum - optical network and single - mode optical cavities , while the second uses a feedback network of such cavities , along with static linear quantum - optical networks that pre- and post - process the cavity network inputs and outputs .
