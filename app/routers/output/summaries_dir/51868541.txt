we discuss the properties of the dynamics of purely memristive circuits using a recently derived consistent equation for the internal memory variables of the involved memristors . in particular , we show that the number of independent memory states in a memristive circuit is constrained by the circuit conservation laws , and that the dynamics preserves these symmetries by means of a projection on the physical subspace . moreover , we discuss other symmetries of the dynamics under various transformations of the internal memory , and study the linearized and strongly non - linear regimes of the dynamics . in the strongly non - linear regime , we derive a conservation law for the internal memory variables . we also provide a condition on the reality of the eigenvalues of lyapunov matrices describing the linearized dynamics close to a fixed point . we show that the eigenvalues ca be imaginary only for mixtures of passive and active components . our last result concerns the weak non - linear regime . we show that the internal memory dynamics can be interpreted as a constrained gradient descent , and provide the functional being minimized . this latter result provides another direct connection between memristors and learning .
