we introduce a new information theoretic measure of quantum correlations for multiparticle systems . we use a form of multivariate mutual information -- the interaction information and generalize it to multiparticle quantum systems . there are a number of different possible generalizations . we consider two of them . one of them is related to the notion of quantum discord and the other to the concept of quantum dissension . this new measure , called dissension vector , is a set of numbers -- quantumness vector . this can be thought of as a fine - grained measure , as opposed to measures that quantify some average quantum properties of a system . these quantities quantify / characterize the correlations present in multiparticle states . we consider some multiqubit states and find that these quantities are responsive to different aspects of quantumness , and correlations present in a state . we find that different dissension vectors can track the correlations ( both classical and quantum ) , or quantumness only . as physical applications , we find that these vectors might be useful in several information processing tasks . we consider the role of dissension vectors -- ( a ) in deciding the security of bb84 protocol against an eavesdropper and ( b ) in determining the possible role of correlations in the performance of grover search algorithm . especially , in the grover search algorithm , we find that dissension vectors can detect the correlations and show the maximum correlations when one expects .
