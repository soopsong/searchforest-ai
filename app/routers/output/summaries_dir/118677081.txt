we study the computational complexity of quantum - mechanical expectation values of single - particle operators in bosonic and fermionic multi - particle product states . such expectation values appear , in particular , in full - counting - statistics problems . depending on the initial multi - product state , the expectation values may be either easy to compute ( the required number of operations scales polynomially with the particle number ) or hard to compute ( at least as hard as a permanent of a matrix ) . however , if we only consider full counting statistics in a finite number of final single - particle states , then the full - counting - statistics generating function becomes easy to compute in all the analyzed cases . we prove the latter statement for the general case of the fermionic product state and for the single - boson product state ( the same as used in the boson - sampling proposal ) . this result may be relevant for using multi - particle product states as a resource for quantum computing .
