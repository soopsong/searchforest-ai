the recently developed formalism of markovian master equations for quantum open systems with external periodic driving is applied to the theory of dynamical decoupling by periodic control . this new approach provides a more detailed quantitative picture of this phenomenon applicable both to traditional nmr spectroscopy and to recent attempts of decoherence reduction in quantum devices . for popular choices of bath spectral densities and a two - level system , exact formulas for the relaxation rates are available . in the context of nmr imaging , the obtained formulas allow the extraction of a new parameter describing bath relaxation time from the experimental data .
