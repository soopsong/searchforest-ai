the ito and stratonovich approaches are carried over to quantum stochastic systems . here the white noise representation is shown to be the most appropriate as here the two approaches appear as wick and weyl orderings , respectively . this introduces for the first time the stratonovich form for sdes driven by poisson processes or quantum sdes including the conservation process . the relation of the nonlinear heisenberg odes to asymptotic quantum sdes is established extending previous work on linear ( schrodinger ) equations . this is shown to generalize the classical integral transformations between the various forms of stochastic calculi and to extend the khasminskii theorem to the quantum setting .
