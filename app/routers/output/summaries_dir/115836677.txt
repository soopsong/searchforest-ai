nonreciprocal microwave devices , such as circulators , are useful in routing quantum signals in quantum networks and protecting quantum systems against noise coming from the detection chain . however , commercial , cryogenic circulators , now in use , are unsuitable for scalable superconducting quantum architectures due to their appreciable size , loss , and inherent magnetic field . we report on the measurement of a key nonreciprocal element , i.e. , the gyrator , which can be used to realize a circulator . unlike state - of - the - art gyrators , which use a magneto - optic effect to induce a phase shift of $ \pi$ between transmitted signals in opposite directions , our device uses the phase nonreciprocity of a josephson - based three - wave - mixing device . by coupling two of these mixers and operating them in noiseless frequency - conversion mode , we show that the device acts as a nonreciprocal phase shifter whose phase shift is controlled by the phase difference of the microwave tones driving the mixers . such a device could be used to realize a lossless , on - chip , superconducting circulator suitable for quantum - information - processing applications .
