we implement an entanglement distribution network based on wavelength - multiplexing and optical switching for quantum communication applications . using a high - brightness source based on spontaneous parametric down - conversion in periodically - poled lithium niobate waveguides , we generate polarisation entangled photon pairs with a broad spectrum covering the telecom wavelengths around 1550 nm . the photon pairs have entanglement fidelities up to 99 % , and are distributed via passive wavelength multiplexing in a static multi - user network . we furthermore demonstrate a possible network application in a scenario with a single centralised source dynamically allocating two - party entanglement to any pair of users by means of optical switches . the whole system , from the pump laser up to the receivers , is fibre and waveguide based , resulting in maximal stability , minimal losses and the advantage of readily integrable telecom components in the 1550 nm range .
