the optical conductivity of graphene strained uniaxially is studied within the kubo - greenwood formalism . focusing on inter - band absorption , we analyze and quantify the breakdown of universal transparency in the visible region of the spectrum , and analytically characterize the transparency as a function of strain and polarization . measuring transmittance as a function of incident polarization directly reflects the magnitude and direction of strain . moreover , direction - dependent selection rules permit identification of the lattice orientation by monitoring the van - hove transitions . these photoelastic effects in graphene can be explored towards atomically thin , broadband optical elements .
