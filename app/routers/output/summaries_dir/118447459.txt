cavities with periodically oscillating mirrors have been predicted to excite photon pairs out of the quantum vacuum in a process known as the dynamical casimir effect . here we propose and analyse an experimental layout that can provide an efficient modulation of the effective optical length of a cavity mode in the near - infrared spectral region . an analytical model of the dynamical casimir emission is developed and compared to the predictions of a direct numerical solution of maxwell 's equations in real time . a sizeable intensity of dynamical casimir emission is anticipated for realistic operating parameters . in the presence of an external coherent seed beam , we predict amplification of the seed beam and the appearance of an additional phase - conjugate beam as a consequence of stimulated dynamical casimir processes .
