we introduce a novel near - quantum - limited amplifier with a large tunable bandwidth and high dynamic range - the josephson array mode parametric amplifier ( jampa ) . the signal and idler modes involved in the amplification process are realized by the array modes of a chain of 1000 flux tunable , josephson - junction - based , nonlinear elements . the frequency spacing between array modes is comparable to the flux tunability of the modes , ensuring that any desired frequency can be occupied by a resonant mode , which can further be pumped to produce high gain . we experimentally demonstrate that the device can be operated as a nearly quantum - limited parametric amplifier with 20 db of gain at almost any frequency within ( 4 - 12 ) ghz band . on average , it has a 3 db bandwidth of 11 mhz and input 1 db compression power of -108 dbm , which can go as high as -93 dbm . we envision the application of such a device to the time- and frequency - multiplexed readout of multiple qubits , as well as to the generation of continuous - variable cluster states .
