we examine the propagation of single photons in periodic and disordered dimer chains coupled to one - dimensional chiral and bidirectional waveguides . each dimer is composed of two dipole - coupled atoms . in the disordered setting , we separately treat two types of position disorder , namely in dimer length and in dimer separation . the focus of this study is to understand in what ways the interplay between dipole - dipole interactions and directionality of photon emission can impact the transport of single photons . cold atoms trapped near optical fibers can serve as an experimentally realizable platform for the models that we consider .
