optical cavity qed provides a platform with which to explore quantum many - body physics in driven - dissipative systems . single - mode cavities provide strong , infinite - range photon - mediated interactions among intracavity atoms . however , these global all - to - all couplings are limiting from the perspective of exploring quantum many - body physics beyond the mean - field approximation . the present work demonstrates that local couplings can be created using multimode cavity qed . this is established through measurements of the threshold of a superradiant , self - organization phase transition versus atomic position . specifically , we experimentally show that the interference of near - degenerate cavity modes leads to both a strong and tunable - range interaction between bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) trapped within the cavity . we exploit the symmetry of a confocal cavity to measure the interaction between real becs and their virtual images without unwanted contributions arising from the merger of real becs . atom - atom coupling may be tuned from short range to long range . this capability paves the way toward future explorations of exotic , strongly correlated systems such as quantum liquid crystals and driven - dissipative spin glasses .
