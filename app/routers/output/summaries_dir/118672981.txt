we provide a new approach to study the noncommutative effects on the neutral dirac particle with anomalous magnetic or electric dipole moment on the noncommutative plane . the advantages of this approach are demonstrated by investigating the noncommutative corrections on the aharonov - casher and he - mckellar - wilkens effects . this approach is based on the effective $ u(1)$ gauge symmetry for the electrodynamics of spin on the two dimensional space . the seiberg - witten map for this symmetry is then employed when we study the noncommutative corrections . because the seiberg - witten map preserves the gauge symmetry , the noncommutative corrections can be defined consistently with the ordinary phases . based on this approach we find the noncommutative corrections on the aharonov - casher and he - mckellar - wilkens phases consist of two terms . the first one depends on the beam particle velocity and consistence with the previous results . however the second term is velocity - independent and then completely new . therefore our results indicate it is possible to investigate the noncommutative space by using ultra - cold neutron interferometer in which the velocity - dependent term is negligible . furthermore , both these two terms are proportional to the ratio between the noncommutative parameter $ \theta$ and the cross section $ a_{e / m}$ of the electrical / magnetic charged line enclosed by the trajectory of beam particles . therefore the experimental sensitivity can be significantly enhanced by reduce the cross section of the charge line $ a_{e / m}$.
