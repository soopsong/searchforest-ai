this paper is concerned with constructing an optimal controller in the coherent quantum linear quadratic gaussian problem . a coherent quantum controller is itself a quantum system and is required to be physically realizable . the use of coherent control avoids the need for classical measurements , which inherently entail the loss of quantum information . physical realizability corresponds to the equivalence of the controller to an open quantum harmonic oscillator and relates its state - space matrices to the hamiltonian , coupling and scattering operators of the oscillator . the hamiltonian parameterization of the controller is combined with frechet differentiation of the lqg cost with respect to the state - space matrices to obtain equations for the optimal controller . a quasi - separation principle for the gain matrices of the quantum controller is established , and a newton - like iterative scheme for numerical solution of the equations is outlined .
