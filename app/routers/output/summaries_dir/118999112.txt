an evolution between a system and its environment which leads to pure dephasing of the system may either be a result of entanglement building up between the system and the environment or not ( the second option is only possible for initially mixed environmental states ) . we find a way of distinguishing between an entangling and non - entangling evolutions for systems which are larger than a single qubit . the generalization of the single qubit separability criterion to larger systems is not sufficient to make this distinction ( it constitutes a necessary condition of separability ) . a set of additional conditions for the operators describing the evolution of the environment depending on the state of the system is required . we find that the commutation of these environmental operators with the initial state of the environment does not guarantee separability , products of the operators need to commute among themselves for a pure dephasing evolution not to be accompanied by system - environment entanglement generation . this is a qualitative difference with respect to the single - qubit case , since it allows for a system to entangle with an initially completely mixed environment .
