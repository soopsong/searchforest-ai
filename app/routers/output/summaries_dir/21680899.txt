we present a theoretical study of minimum error probability discrimination , using quantum- optical probe states , of m optical phase shifts situated symmetrically on the unit circle . we assume ideal lossless conditions and full freedom for implementing quantum measurements and for probe state selection , subject only to a constraint on the average energy , i.e. , photon number . in particular , the probe state is allowed to have any number of signal and ancillary modes , and to be pure or mixed . our results are based on a simple criterion that partitions the set of pure probe states into equivalence classes with the same error probability performance . under an energy constraint , we find the explicit form of the state that minimizes the error probability . this state is an unentangled but nonclassical single - mode state . the error performance of the optimal state is compared with several standard states in quantum optics . we also show that discrimination with zero error is possible only beyond a threshold energy of ( m - 1)/2 . for the m = 2 case , we show that the optimum performance is readily demonstrable with current technology . while transmission loss and detector inefficiencies lead to a nonzero erasure probability , the error rate conditional on no erasure is shown to remain the same as the optimal lossless error rate .
