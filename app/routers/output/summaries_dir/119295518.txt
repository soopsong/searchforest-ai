we study theoretically the dynamics of multiple mechanical oscillators coupled to a single cavity field mode via linear or quadratic optomechanical interactions . we focus specifically on the strong coupling regime where the cavity decays much faster than the mechanical modes , and the optomechanical coupling is comparable to or larger than the mechanical frequency , so that both the optical and mechanical systems operate in the deep quantum regime . using the examples of one and two mechanical oscillators we show that the system can classically exhibit bistability and bifurcations , and we explore how these manifest themselves in interference , entanglement , and correlation in the quantum theory , while revealing the impact of decoherence of the mechanical system due to cavity fluctuations and coherent driving .
