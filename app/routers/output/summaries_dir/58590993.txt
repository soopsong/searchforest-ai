we show that the gravitational acceleration can be measured with the matter - wave ramsey interferometry , by using a nitrogen - vacancy center coupled to a nano - mechanical resonator . we propose two experimental methods to realize the hamiltonian , by using either a cantilever resonator or a trapped nanoparticle . the scheme is robust against the thermal noise , and could be realized at the temperature much higher than the quantum regime one . the effects of decoherence on the interferometry fringe visibility is caculated , including the mechanical motional decay and dephasing of the nitrogen - vacancy center . in addition , we demonstrate that under the various sources of random and systematic noises , our gravimeter can be made on - chip and achieving a high measurement precision . under experimental feasible parameters , the proposed gravimeter could achieve $ 10^{-10}$ relative precision .
