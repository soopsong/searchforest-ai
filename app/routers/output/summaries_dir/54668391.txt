we study the impact of structural variations ( that is slowly varying geometry aberrations and internal strain fields ) on the width and shape of the stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) resonance in nanoscale waveguides . we find that they lead to an homogeneous resonance broadening through two distinct mechanisms : firstly , the acoustic frequency is directly influenced via mechanical nonlinearities ; secondly , the optical wave numbers are influenced via the opto - mechanical nonlinearity leading to an additional acoustic frequency shift via the phase - matching condition . we find that this second mechanism is proportional to the opto - mechanical coupling and , hence , related to the sbs - gain itself . it is absent in intra - mode forward sbs , while it plays a significant role in backward scattering . in backward sbs increasing the opto - acoustic overlap beyond a threshold defined by the fabrication tolerances will therefore no longer yield the expected quadratic increase in overall stokes amplification . finally , we illustrate in a numerical example that in backward sbs and inter - mode forward sbs the existence of two broadening mechanisms with opposite sign also opens the possibility to compensate the effect of geometry - induced broadening . our results can be transferred to other micro- and nano - structured waveguide geometries such as photonic crystal fibres .
