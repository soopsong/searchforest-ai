we address the dynamics of quantum correlations in a two - qubit system subject to unbalanced random telegraph noise ( rtn ) and discuss in details the similarities and the differences with the balanced case . we also evaluate quantum non - markovianity of the dynamical map . finally , we discuss the effects of unbalanced rtn on teleportation , showing that noise imbalance mitigates decoherence and preserves teleportation fidelity .
