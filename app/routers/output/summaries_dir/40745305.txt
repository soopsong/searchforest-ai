in this paper , a study on discrete - time coined quantum walks on the line is presented . clear mathematical foundations are still lacking for this quantum walk model . as a step towards this objective , the following question is being addressed : { \it given a graph , what is the probability that a quantum walk arrives at a given vertex after some number of steps ? } this is a very natural question , and for random walks it can be answered by several different combinatorial arguments . for quantum walks this is a highly non - trivial task . furthermore , this was only achieved before for one specific coin operator ( hadamard operator ) for walks on the line . even considering only walks on lines , generalizing these computations to a general su(2 ) coin operator is a complex task . the main contribution is a closed - form formula for the amplitudes of the state of the walk ( which includes the question above ) for a general symmetric su(2 ) operator for walks on the line . to this end , a coin operator with parameters that alters the phase of the state of the walk is defined . then , closed - form solutions are computed by means of fourier analysis and asymptotic approximation methods . we also present some basic properties of the walk which can be deducted using weak convergence theorems for quantum walks . in particular , the support of the induced probability distribution of the walk is calculated . then , it is shown how changing the parameters in the coin operator affects the resulting probability distribution .
