we establish quantum thermodynamics for open quantum systems weakly coupled to their reservoirs when the system exhibits degeneracies . the first and second law of thermodynamics are derived , as well as a finite - time fluctuation theorem for mechanical work and energy and matter currents . using a double quantum dot junction model , local eigenbasis coherences are shown to play a crucial role on thermodynamics and on the electron counting statistics .
