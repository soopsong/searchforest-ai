in this paper we consider a bosonic josephson junction described by a two - mode bose - hubbard model , and we thoroughly analyze a quantum phase transition occurring in the system in the limit of infinite bosonic population . we discuss the relation between this quantum phase transition and the dynamical bifurcation occurring in the spectrum of the discrete self trapping equations describing the system at the semiclassical level . in particular , we identify five regimes depending on the strength of the effective interaction among bosons , and study the finite - size effects arising from the finiteness of the bosonic population . we devote a special attention to the critical regime which reduces to the dynamical bifurcation point in the thermodynamic limit of infinite bosonic population . specifically , we highlight an anomalous scaling in the population imbalance between the two wells of the trapping potential , as well as in two quantities borrowed from quantum information theory , i.e. the entropy of entanglement and the ground - state fidelity . our analysis is not limited to the zero temperature case , but considers thermal effects as well .
