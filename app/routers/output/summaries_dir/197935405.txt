we present a scheme for generating and manipulating three - mode squeezed states with genuine tripartite entanglement by injecting single - mode squeezed light into an array of coupled optical waveguides . we explore the possibility to selectively generate single - mode squeezing or multimode squeezing at the output of an elliptical waveguides array , determined solely by the input light polarization . we study the effect of losses in the waveguides array and show that quantum correlations and squeezing are preserved for realistic parameters . our results show that arrays of optical waveguides are suitable platforms for generating multimode quantum light , which could lead to novel applications in quantum metrology .
