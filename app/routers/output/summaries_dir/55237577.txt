non - markovian stochastic schr\"odinger equations ( nmsse ) are important tools in quantum mechanics , from the theory of open systems to foundations . yet , in general , they are but formal objects : their solution can be computed numerically only in some specific cases or perturbatively . this article is focused on the nmsse themselves rather than on the open - system evolution they unravel and aims at making them less abstract . namely , we propose to write the stochastic realizations of linear nmsse as averages over the solutions of an auxiliary equation with an additional random field . our method yields a non - perturbative numerical simulation algorithm for generic linear nmsse that can be made arbitrarily accurate for reasonably short times . for isotropic complex noises , the method extends from linear to non - linear nmsse and allows to sample the solutions of norm - preserving nmsse directly .
