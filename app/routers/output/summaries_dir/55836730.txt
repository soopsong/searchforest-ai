we apply the stochastic master equations ( quantum filter ) derived by gough et al . ( proc . 50th ieee conference on decision and control , 2011 ) to a system consisting of a cavity driven by a multimode single photon field . in particular , we analyse the conditional dynamics for the problem of cross phase modulation in a doubly resonant cavity . through the exact integration of the stochastic equations , our results reveal features of the problem unavailable from previous models .
