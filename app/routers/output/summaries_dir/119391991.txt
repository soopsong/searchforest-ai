we show that connections between a degree of incompatibility of pairs of observables and the strength of violations of bell 's inequality found in recent investigations can be extended to a general class of probabilistic physical models . it turns out that the property of universal uniform steering is sufficient for the saturation of a generalised tsirelson bound , corresponding to maximal violations of bell 's inequality . it is also found that a limited form of steering is still available and sufficient for such saturation in some state spaces where universal uniform steering is not given . the techniques developed here are applied to the class of regular polygon state spaces , giving a strengthening of known results . however , we also find indications that the link between incompatibility and bell violation may be more complex than originally envisaged .
