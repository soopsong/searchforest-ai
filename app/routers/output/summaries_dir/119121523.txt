nowadays , geometric tools are being used to treat a huge class of problems of quantum information science . by understanding the interplay between the geometry of the state space and information - theoretic quantities , it is possible to obtain less trivial and more robust physical constraints on quantum systems . in this sense , here we establish a geometric lower bound for the wigner - yanase skew information ( wysi ) , a well - known information theoretic quantity recently recognized as a proper quantum coherence measure . starting from a mixed state evolving under unitary dynamics , while wysi is a constant of motion , the lower bound indicates the rate of change of quantum statistical distinguishability between initial and final states . our result shows that , since wysi fits in the class of petz metrics , this lower bound is the change rate of its respective geodesic distance on quantum state space . the geometric approach is advantageous because raises several physical interpretations of this inequality under the same theoretical umbrella .
