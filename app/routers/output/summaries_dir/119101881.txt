in this paper we formulate a risk - sensitive optimal control problem for continuously monitored open quantum systems modelled by quantum langevin equations . the optimal controller is expressed in terms of a modified conditional state , which we call a risk - sensitive state , that represents measurement knowledge tempered by the control purpose . one of the two components of the optimal controller is dynamic , a filter that computes the risk - sensitive state . the second component is an optimal control feedback function that is found by solving the dynamic programming equation . the optimal controller can be implemented using classical electronics . the ideas are illustrated using an example of feedback control of a two - level atom .
