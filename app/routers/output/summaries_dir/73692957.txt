a bose gas in a double well is investigated in the presence of single - particle , two - body and three - body asymmetric loss . the loss induces an interesting decay behavior of the total population as well as a possibility to control the dynamics of the system . in the noninteracting limit with asymmetric single - body dissipation , the dynamics of the populations can be obtained analytically . the general many - body problem requires , however , an adequate approximation . we use a mean - field approximation and the bogoliubov back - reaction beyond mean - field truncation , which we extend up to three - body loss . both methods are compared with exact many - body monte - carlo simulations .
