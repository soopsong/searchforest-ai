the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) argument provides an all - or - nothing contradiction between quantum mechanics and local - realistic theories . in its original formulation , ghz investigated three and four particles entangled in two dimensions only . very recently , higher dimensional contradictions especially in three dimensions and three particles have been discovered but it has remained unclear how to produce such states . in this article we experimentally show how to generate a three - dimensional ghz state from two - photon orbital - angular - momentum entanglement . the first suggestion for a setup which generates three - dimensional ghz entanglement from these entangled pairs came from using the computer algorithm melvin . the procedure employs novel concepts significantly beyond the qubit case . our experiment opens up the possibility of a truly high - dimensional test of the ghz - contradiction which , interestingly , employs non - hermitian operators .
