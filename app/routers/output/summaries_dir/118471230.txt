we address the dynamics of quantum correlations for a bipartite continuous - variable quantum system interacting with its fluctuating environment . in particular , we consider two independent quantum oscillators initially prepared in a gaussian state , e.g. a squeezed thermal state , and compare the dynamics resulting from local noise , i.e. oscillators coupled to two independent external fields , to that originating from common noise , i.e. oscillators interacting with a single common field . we prove non - markovianity ( non - divisibility ) of the dynamics in both regimes and analyze the connections between non - divisibility , backflow of information and revivals of quantum correlations . our main results may be summarized as follows : ( i ) revivals of quantumness are present in both scenarios , however , the interaction with a common environment better preserves the quantum features of the system ; ( ii ) the dynamics is always non - divisible but revivals of quantum correlations are present only when backflow of information is present as well . we conclude that non - divisibility in its own is not a resource to preserve quantum correlations in our system , i.e. it is not sufficient to observe recoherence phenomena . rather , it represents a necessary prerequisite to obtain backflow of information , which is the true ingredient to obtain revivals of quantumness .
