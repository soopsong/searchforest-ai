the set of doubly - stochastic quantum channels and its subset of mixtures of unitaries are investigated . we provide a detailed analysis of their structure together with computable criteria for the separation of the two sets . when applied to o(d)-covariant channels this leads to a complete characterization and reveals a remarkable feature : instances of channels which are not in the convex hull of unitaries can return to it when either taking finitely many copies of them or supplementing with a completely depolarizing channel . in these scenarios this implies that a channel whose noise initially resists any environment - assisted attempt of correction can become perfectly correctable .
