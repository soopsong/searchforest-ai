we discuss the theory and experimental considerations of a quantum feedback scheme for producing deterministically reproducible spin squeezing . continuous nondemolition atom number measurement from monitoring a probe field conditionally squeezes the sample . simultaneous feedback of the measurement results controls the quantum state such that the squeezing becomes unconditional . we find that for very strong cavity coupling and a limited number of atoms , the theoretical squeezing approaches the heisenberg limit . strong squeezing will still be produced at weaker coupling and even in free space ( thus presenting a simple experimental test for quantum feedback ) . the measurement and feedback can be stopped at any time , thereby freezing the sample with a desired amount of squeezing .
