we consider the quantum boltzmann equation , which describes the growth of the condensate , or in other words , models the interaction between excited atoms and a condensate . in this work , the full form of bogoliubov dispersion law is considered , which leads to a detailed study of surface integrals inside the collision operator on energy manifolds . we prove that positive radial solutions of the quantum boltzmann equation are bounded from below by a gaussian , uniformly in time .
