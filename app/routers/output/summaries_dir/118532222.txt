in arxiv:1508.01343 [ hep - th ] , one of the authors proposed that in ads / cft the gravity dual of the boundary $ c$-theorem is the second law of thermodynamics satisfied by causal horizons in ads and this was verified for einstein gravity in the bulk . in this paper we verify this for higher derivative theories . we pick up theories for which an entropy expression satisfying the second law exists and show that the entropy density evaluated on the causal horizon in a rg flow geometry is a holographic c - function . we also prove that given a theory of gravity described by a local covariant action in the bulk a sufficient condition to ensure holographic c - theorem is that the second law of causal horizon thermodynamics be satisfied by the theory . this allows us to explicitly construct holographic c - function in a theory where there is curvature coupling between gravity and matter and standard null energy condition can not be defined although second law is known to hold . based on the duality between c - theorem and the second law of causal horizon thermodynamics proposed in arxiv:1508.01343 [ hep - th ] and the supporting calculations of this paper we conjecture that every unitary higher derivative theory of gravity in ads satisfies the second law of causal horizon thermodynamics . if this is not true then c - theorem will be violated in a unitary lorentz invariant field theory .
