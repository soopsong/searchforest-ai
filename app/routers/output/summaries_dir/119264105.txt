the field of optomechanics provides us with several examples of quantum photon - phonon interface . in this paper , we theoretically investigate the generation and manipulation of quantum correlations in a microfabricated optomechanical array . we consider a system consisting of localized photonic and phononic modes interacting locally via radiation pressure at each lattice site with the possibility of hopping of photons and phonons between neighboring sites . we show that such an interaction can correlate various modes of a driven coupled optomechanical array with well - chosen system parameters . moreover , in the linearized regime of gaussian fluctuations , the quantum correlations not only survive in the presence of thermal noise , but may also be generated thermally . we find that these optomechanical arrays provide a suitable platform for quantum simulation of various many - body systems .
