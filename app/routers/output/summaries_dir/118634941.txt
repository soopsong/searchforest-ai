quantum correlations may be measured by means of the distance of the state to the subclass of states $ \omega$ having well defined classical properties . in particular , a geometric measure of asymmetric discord [ dakic et al . , phys . rev . lett . 105 , 190502 ( 2010 ) ] was recently defined as the hilbert - schmidt distance of a given two - qubit state to the closest classical - quantum ( cq ) correlated state . we analyze a geometric measure of symmetric discord defined as the hilbert - schmidt distance of a given state to the closest classical - classical ( cc ) correlated state . the optimal member of $ \omega$ is just specially measured original state both for the cq and cc discords . this implies that this measure is equal to quantum deficit of post - measurement purity . we discuss some general relations between the cc discords and explain why an analytical formula for the cc discord , contrary to the cq discord , can hardly be found even for a general two - qubit state . instead of such exact formula , we find simple analytical measurement - based upper bounds for the cc discord which , as we show , are very efficient in the case of two qubits and may serve as independent indicators of two - party quantum correlations . in particular , we propose an adaptive upper bound , which corresponds to the optimal states induced by single - party measurements : optimal measurement on one of the parties determines an optimal measurement on the other party . we discuss how to refine the adaptive upper bound by nonoptimal single - party measurements and by an iterative procedure which usually rapidly converges to the cc discord . we also raise the question of optimality of the symmetric measurements realising the cc discord on symmetric states , and give partial answer for the qubit case .
