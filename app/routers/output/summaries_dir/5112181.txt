the interplay between non - markovian dynamics and driving fields in the survival of entanglement between two non - degenerate oscillators is considered here . based on exact analytical results for the non - markovian dynamics of two parametrically coupled non - degenerate oscillators in contact to non - identical independent thermal baths , the out - of - equilibrium quantum limit derived in [ phys . rev . lett . 105 , 180501 ( 2010 ) ] is generalized to the non - markovian regime . specifically , it is shown that non - markovian dynamics , when compared to the markovian case , allow for the survival of stationary entanglement at higher temperatures , with larger coupling strength to the baths and at smaller driving rates . the effect of the asymmetry of the ( i ) coupled oscillators , ( ii ) coupling strength to the baths at equal temperature and ( iii ) temperature at equal coupling strength is discussed .
