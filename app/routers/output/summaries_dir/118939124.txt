we investigate the dynamics under diabatic expansions / compressions of linear ion chains.combining a dynamical normal - mode harmonic approximation with the invariant - based inverse - engineering technique , we design protocols that minimize the final motional excitation of the ions . this can substantially reduce the transition time between high and low trap - frequency operations , potentially contributing to the development of scalable quantum information processing .
