experiments directed towards the development of a quantum computer based on trapped atomic ions are described briefly . we discuss the implementation of single qubit operations and gates between qubits . a geometric phase gate between two ion qubits is described . limitations of the trapped - ion method such as those caused by stark shifts and spontaneous emission are addressed . finally , we describe a strategy to realize a large - scale device .
