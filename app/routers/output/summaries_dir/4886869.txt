we investigate entanglement distribution in pure - state quantum networks . we consider the case when non - maximally entangled two - qubit pure states are shared by neighboring nodes of the network . for a given pair of nodes , we investigate how to generate the maximal entanglement between them by performing local measurements , assisted by classical communication , on the other nodes . we find optimal measurement protocols for both small and large 1d networks . quite surprisingly , we prove that bell measurements are not always the optimal ones to perform in such networks . we generalize then the results to simple small 2d networks , finding again counter - intuitive optimal measurement strategies . finally , we consider large networks with hierarchical lattice geometries and 2d networks . we prove that perfect entanglement can be established on large distances with probability one in a finite number of steps , provided the initial entanglement shared by neighboring nodes is large enough . we discuss also various protocols of entanglement distribution in 2d networks employing classical and quantum percolation strategies .
