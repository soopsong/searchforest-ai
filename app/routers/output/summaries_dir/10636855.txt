a reinforcement algorithm solves a classical optimization problem by introducing a feedback to the system which slowly changes the energy landscape and converges the algorithm to an optimal solution in the configuration space . here , we use this strategy to concentrate ( localize ) preferentially the wave function of a quantum particle , which explores the configuration space of the problem , on an optimal configuration . we examine the method by solving numerically the equations governing the evolution of the system , which are similar to the nonlinear schr\"odinger equations , for small problem sizes . in particular , we observe that reinforcement increases the minimal energy gap of the system in a quantum annealing algorithm . our numerical simulations and the latter observation show that such kind of quantum feedbacks might be helpful in solving a computationally hard optimization problem by a quantum reinforcement algorithm .
