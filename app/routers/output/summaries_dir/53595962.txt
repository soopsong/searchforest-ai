correlations of an environment are crucial for the dynamics of non - markovian quantum systems , which may not be known in advance . in this paper , we propose a gradient algorithm for identifying the correlations in terms of time - varying damping rate functions in a time - convolution - less master equation for spin chains . by measuring time trace observables of the system , the identification procedure can be formulated as an optimization problem . the gradient algorithm is designed based on a calculation of the derivative of an objective function with respect to the damping rate functions , whose effectiveness is shown in a comparison to a differential approach for a two - qubit spin chain .
