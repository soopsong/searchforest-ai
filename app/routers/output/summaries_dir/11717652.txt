until recently , the physically relevant singularities occurring in frw cosmologies had traditionally been thought to be limited to the"big bang " , and possibly a"big crunch " . however , over the last few years , the zoo of cosmological singularities considered in the literature has become considerably more extensive , with"big rips"and"sudden singularities"added to the mix , as well as renewed interest in non - singular cosmological events such as"bounces"and"turnarounds " . in this talk , we present an extensive catalogue of such cosmological milestones , both at the kinematical and dynamical level . first , using generalized power series , purely kinematical definitions of these cosmological events are provided in terms of the behaviour of the scale factor a(t ) . the notion of a"scale - factor singularity"is defined , and its relation to curvature singularities ( polynomial and differential ) is explored . second , dynamical information is extracted by using the friedmann equations ( without assuming even the existence of any equation of state ) to place constraints on whether or not the classical energy conditions are satisfied at the cosmological milestones . since the classification is extremely general , and modulo certain technical assumptions complete , the corresponding results are to a high degree model - independent .
