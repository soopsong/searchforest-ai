the nuclear spin bath ( nsb ) dynamics and its quantum control are of importance for the storage and processing of quantum information within a semiconductor environment . in the presence of a carrier spin , primarily it is the hyperfine interaction that rules the high frequency nsb characteristics . here , we first study the overall coherence decay and rephasings in a hyperfine - driven nsb through the temporal and spectral behaviors of the so - called loschmidt echo ( le ) . its dependence on the nsb size , initial polarization , and coupling inhomogeneity are separately investigated , which leads to a simple phenomenological expression that can accommodate all of these attributes . unlike the prevailing emphasis on spin 1/2 , the nsbs with larger spin quantum numbers are equally considered . for this case , additionally the effect of nuclear electric quadrupole interaction is taken into account where its biaxiality term is influential on the decoherence . the insights gained from model systems are then put to use for two generic realistic semiconductor systems , namely , a donor center and a quantum dot that represent small and large nanoscale nsb examples , respectively . the spectrum of le for large quantum dots can reach the 100~mhz range , whereas , for donor centers , it reduces to a few mhz , making them readily amenable for dynamical decoupling techniques . the effect of quadrupole interaction on le is seen to be negligible for large quantum dots , while it becomes significant for donor centers , most notably in the form of depolarizing a polarized nsb .
