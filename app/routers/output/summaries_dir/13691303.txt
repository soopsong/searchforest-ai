we present a numerical method for calculating quasi - normal modes of open nanophotonic structures . the method is based on scattering matrices and a unity eigenvalue of the roundtrip matrix of an internal cavity , and we develop it in detail with electromagnetic fields expanded on bloch modes of periodic structures . this procedure is simpler to implement numerically and more intuitive than previous scattering matrix methods , and any routine based on scattering matrices can benefit from the method . we demonstrate the calculation of quasi - normal modes for two - dimensional photonic crystals where cavities are side - coupled and in - line - coupled to an infinite w1 waveguide and show that the scattering spectrum of these types of cavities can be reconstructed from the complex quasi - normal mode frequency .
