the two - qubit canonical decomposition su(4 ) = [ su(2 ) \otimes su(2 ) ] delta [ su(2 ) \otimes su(2 ) ] writes any two - qubit quantum computation as a composition of a local unitary , a relative phasing of bell states , and a second local unitary . using lie theory , we generalize this to an n - qubit decomposition , the concurrence canonical decomposition ( c.c.d . ) su(2^n)=kak . the group k fixes a bilinear form related to the concurrence , and in particular any computation in k preserves the tangle |<phi^*|(-i sigma^y_1) ... (-i sigma^y_n)|phi>|^2 for n even . thus , the c.c.d . shows that any n - qubit quantum computation is a composition of a computation preserving this n - tangle , a computation in a which applies relative phases to a set of ghz states , and a second computation which preserves it . as an application , we study the extent to which a large , random unitary may change concurrence . the result states that for a randomly chosen a in a within su(2^{2p } ) , the probability that a carries a state of tangle 0 to a state of maximum tangle approaches 1 as the even number of qubits approaches infinity . any v = k_1 a k_2 for such an a \in a has the same property . finally , although |<phi^*|(-i sigma^y_1) ... (-i sigma^y_n)|phi>|^2 vanishes identically when the number of qubits is odd , we show that a more complicated c.c.d . still exists in which k is a symplectic group .
