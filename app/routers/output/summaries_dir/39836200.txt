in this paper we define a quantum stochastic walk on arbitrary directed graph with super - diffusive propagation on a line graph . our model is based on global environment interaction qsw , which is known to have ballistic propagation . however we discovered , that in this case additional amplitude transitions occur , hence graph topology is changed into moral graph . because of that we call the effect a spontaneous moralization . we propose a general correction scheme , which is proved to remove unnecessary transition and thus to preserve the graph topology . in the end we numerically show , that super - diffusive propagation is preserved . because of that our new model may be applied as effective evolution on arbitrary directed graph .
