optimal control of bilinear systems has been a well - studied subject in the area of mathematical control . however , techniques for solving emerging optimal control problems involving an ensemble of structurally identical bilinear systems are underdeveloped . in this work , we develop an iterative method to effectively and systematically solve these challenging optimal ensemble control problems , in which the bilinear ensemble system is represented as a time - varying linear ensemble system at each iteration and the optimal ensemble control law is then obtained by the singular value expansion of the input - to - state operator that describes the dynamics of the linear ensemble system . we examine the convergence of the developed iterative procedure and pose optimality conditions for the convergent solution . we also provide examples of practical control designs in magnetic resonance to demonstrate the applicability and robustness of the developed iterative method .
