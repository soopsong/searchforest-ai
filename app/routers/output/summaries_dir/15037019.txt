vortices in superconductors driven at microwave frequencies exhibit a response related to the interplay between the vortex viscosity , pinning strength , and flux creep effects . at the same time , the trapping of vortices in superconducting microwave resonant circuits contributes excess loss and can result in substantial reductions in the quality factor . thus , understanding the microwave vortex response in superconducting thin films is important for the design of such circuits , including superconducting qubits and photon detectors , which are typically operated in small , but non - zero , magnetic fields . by cooling in fields of the order of 100 $ \mu$t and below , we have characterized the magnetic field and frequency dependence of the microwave response of a small density of vortices in resonators fabricated from thin films of re and al , which are common materials used in superconducting microwave circuits . above a certain threshold cooling field , which is different for the re and al films , vortices become trapped in the resonators . vortices in the al resonators contribute greater loss and are influenced more strongly by flux creep effects than in the re resonators . this different behavior can be described in the framework of a general vortex dynamics model .
