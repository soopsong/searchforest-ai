linear nearest neighbor ( lnn ) synthesis in reversible circuits has emerged as an important issue in terms of technological implementation for quantum computation . the objective is to obtain a lnn architecture with minimum gate cost . as achieving optimal synthesis is a hard problem , heuristic methods have been proposed in recent literature . in this work we present a graph partitioning based approach for lnn synthesis with reduction in circuit cost . in particular , the number of swap gates required to convert a given gate - level quantum circuit to its equivalent lnn configuration is minimized . our algorithm determines the reordering of indices of the qubit line(s ) for both single control and multiple controlled gates . experimental results for placing the target qubits of multiple controlled toffoli ( mct ) library of benchmark circuits show a significant reduction in gate count and quantum gate cost compared to those of related research works .
