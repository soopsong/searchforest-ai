this is a survey of some very old knowledge about mutually unbiased bases ( mub ) and symmetric informationally complete povms ( sic ) . in prime dimensions the former are closely tied to an elliptic normal curve symmetric under the heisenberg group , while the latter are believed to be orbits under the heisenberg group in all dimensions . in dimensions 3 and 4 the sics are understandable in terms of elliptic curves , but a general statement escapes us . the geometry of the sics in 3 and 4 dimensions is discussed in some detail .
