we study a class of systems of stochastic differential equations describing diffusive phenomena . the smoluchowski - kramers approximation is used to describe their dynamics in the small mass limit . our systems have arbitrary state - dependent friction and noise coefficients . we identify the limiting equation and , in particular , the additional drift term that appears in the limit is expressed in terms of the solution to a lyapunov matrix equation . the proof uses a theory of convergence of stochastic integrals developed by kurtz and protter . the result is sufficiently general to include systems driven by both white and ornstein - uhlenbeck colored noises . we discuss applications of the main theorem to several physical phenomena , including the experimental study of brownian motion in a diffusion gradient .
