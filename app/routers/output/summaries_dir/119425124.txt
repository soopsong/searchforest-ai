we propose two experimental setups for fermionic atoms in a high - finesse optical resonator in which either a superconducting state with s - wave symmetry of the pairs or a 4k f charge density wave can self - organize . in order to stabilize the s - wave pairing , a two component attractively in- teracting fermionic gas is confined to a one dimensional chain structure by an optical lattice . the tunneling of the atoms along the chains is suppressed initially by an energy offset between neighbor- ing sites . a raman transition using the cavity mode and a transversal pump laser then reintroduces a cavity - assisted tunneling . the feedback mechanism between the cavity field and the atoms leads to a spontaneous occupation of the cavity field and of a state of the fermionic atoms which is dominated by s - wave pairing correlations . extending the setup to a quasi - one - dimensional ladder structure where the tunneling of atoms along the rungs of the ladder is cavity - assisted , the repul- sively interacting fermionic atoms self - organize into a 4k f charge density wave . we use adiabatic elimination of the cavity field combined with state - of - the - art density matrix renormalization group methods in finite systems in order to identify the steady state phases of the system .
