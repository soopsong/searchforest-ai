we derive fidelity benchmarks for the quantum storage and teleportation of squeezed states of continuous variable systems , for input ensembles where the degree of squeezing $ s$ is fixed , no information about its orientation in phase space is given , and the distribution of phase space displacements is a gaussian . in the limit where the latter becomes flat , we prove analytically that the maximal classical achievable fidelity ( which is 1/2 without squeezing , for $ s=1 $ ) is given by $ \sqrt{s}/(1+s)$ , vanishing when the degree of squeezing diverges . for mixed states , as well as for general distributions of displacements , we reduce the determination of the benchmarks to the solution of a finite - dimensional semidefinite program , which yields accurate , certifiable bounds thanks to a rigorous analysis of the truncation error . this approach may be easily adapted to more general ensembles of input states .
