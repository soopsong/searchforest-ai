i present a variety of results on the theory of quantum secret sharing . i show that any mixed state quantum secret sharing scheme can be derived by discarding a share from a pure state scheme , and that the size of each share in a quantum secret sharing scheme must be at least as large as the size of the secret . i show that the only constraints on the existence of quantum secret sharing schemes with general access structures are monotonicity ( if a set is authorized , so are larger sets ) and the no - cloning theorem . i also discuss some aspects of sharing classical secrets using quantum states . in this situation , the size of each share can sometimes be half the size of the classical secret .
