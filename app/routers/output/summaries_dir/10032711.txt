we provide a tight analysis of grover 's recent algorithm for quantum database searching . we give a simple closed - form formula for the probability of success after any given number of iterations of the algorithm . this allows us to determine the number of iterations necessary to achieve almost certainty of finding the answer . furthermore , we analyse the behaviour of the algorithm when the element to be found appears more than once in the table and we provide a new algorithm to find such an element even when the number of solutions is not known ahead of time . using techniques from shor 's quantum factoring algorithm in addition to grover 's approach , we introduce a new technique for approximate quantum counting , which allows to estimate the number of solutions . finally we provide a lower bound on the efficiency of any possible quantum database searching algorithm and we show that grover 's algorithm nearly comes within a factor 2 of being optimal in terms of the number of probes required in the table .
