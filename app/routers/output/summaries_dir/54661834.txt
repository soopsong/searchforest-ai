if $ a$ is a $ 2n \times 2n$ real positive definite matrix , then there exists a symplectic matrix $ m$ such that $ m^tam = \left [ \begin{array}{cc } d&o \\ o&d \end{array } \right ] $ where $ d= \diag ( d_1 ( a ) , \ldots , d_n(a))$ is a diagonal matrix with positive diagonal entries , which are called the symplectic eigenvalues of $ a.$ in this paper we derive several fundamental inequalities about these numbers . among them are relations between the symplectic eigenvalues of $ a$ and those of $ a^t,$ between the symplectic eigenvalues of $ m$ matrices $ a_1 , \ldots , a_m$ and of their riemannian mean , a perturbation theorem , some variational principles , and some inequalities between the symplectic and ordinary eigenvalues .
