single photon sources are an integral part of various quantum technologies , and solid state quantum emitters at room temperature appear as a promising implementation . we couple the fluorescence of individual silicon vacancy centers in nanodiamonds to a tunable optical microcavity to demonstrate a single photon source with high efficiency , increased emission rate , and improved spectral purity compared to the intrinsic emitter properties . we use a fiber - based microcavity with a mode volume as small as $ 3.4~\lambda^3 $ and a quality factor of $ 1.9\times 10 ^ 4 $ and observe an effective purcell factor of up to 9.2 . we furthermore study modifications of the internal rate dynamics and propose a rate model that closely agrees with the measurements . we observe lifetime changes of up to 31 % , limited by the finite quantum efficiency of the emitters studied here . with improved materials , our achieved parameters predict single photon rates beyond 1 ghz .
