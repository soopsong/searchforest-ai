we suggest a way to overcome the obstacles that disorder and high density of states pose to the creation of unpaired majorana fermions in one - dimensional systems . this is achieved by splitting the system into a chain of quantum dots , which are then tuned to the conditions under which the chain can be viewed as an effective kitaev model , so that it is in a robust topological phase with well - localized majorana states in the outermost dots . the tuning algorithm that we develop involves controlling the gate voltages and the superconducting phases . resonant andreev spectroscopy allows us to make the tuning adaptive , so that each pair of dots may be tuned independently of the other . the calculated quantized zero bias conductance serves then as a natural proof of the topological nature of the tuned phase .
