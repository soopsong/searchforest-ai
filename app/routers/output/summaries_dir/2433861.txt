most of the work on implementing arithmetic on a quantum computer has borrowed from results in classical reversible computing ( e.g. [ vbe95 ] , [ bbf02 ] , [ dkr04 ] ) . these quantum networks are inherently classical , as they can be implemented with only the toffoli gate . draper [ d00 ] has proposed an inherently"quantum"network for addition based on the quantum fourier transform . his approach has the advantage that it requires no carry qubits ( the previous approaches required o(n ) carry qubits ) . the network in [ d00 ] uses quantum rotation gates , which must either be implemented with exponential precision , or else be approximated . in this paper i give a network of o(n^3 ) toffoli gates for reversibly performing in - place addition with only a single ancillary bit , demonstrating that inherently quantum techniques are not required to achieve this goal ( provided we are willing to sacrifice quadratic circuit depth ) . after posting the original version of this note it was pointed out to me by c. zalka that essentially the same technique for addition was used in [ bcd+96 ] . the scenario in that paper was different , but it is clear how the technique they described generalizes to that in this paper .
