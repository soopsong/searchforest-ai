we investigate finite - size scaling of genuine multisite entanglement in the ground state of quantum spin-1/2 heisenberg ladders . we obtain the ground states of odd- and even - legged heisenberg ladder hamiltonians and compute genuine multisite entanglement , the generalized geometric measure ( ggm ) , which shows that for even rungs , ggm increases for odd - legged ladder while it decreases for even ones . interestingly , the ground state obtained by short - range dimer coverings , under the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) ansatz , encapsulates the qualitative features of ggm for both the ladders . we find that while the ggms for higher legged odd- and even - ladders converge to a single value in the asymptotic limit of a large number of rungs , the finite - size scaling exponents of the same tend to diverge . the scaling exponent of ggm obtained by employing density matrix recursion method is therefore a reliable quantity in distinguishing the odd - even dichotomy in heisenberg ladders , even when the corresponding multisite entanglements merge .
