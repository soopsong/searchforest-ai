we establish a construction of the bulk local operators in ads by considering cft at finite energy scale . without assuming any prior knowledge about the bulk , the normalizable solution to the bulk free field equation automatically appears in the field theory arguments . in the radial quantization formalism , we find a properly regularized version of our initial construction . possible generalizations beyond pure ads are also discussed .
