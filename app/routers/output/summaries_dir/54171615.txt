tomography of a quantum state is usually based on positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) and on their experimental statistics . among the available reconstructions , the maximum - likelihood ( maxlike ) technique is an efficient one . we propose an extension of this technique when the measurement process can not be simply described by an instantaneous povm . instead , the tomography relies on a set of quantum trajectories and their measurement records . this model includes the fact that , in practice , each measurement could be corrupted by imperfections and decoherence , and could also be associated with the record of continuous - time signals over a finite amount of time . the goal is then to retrieve the quantum state that was present at the start of this measurement process . the proposed extension relies on an explicit expression of the likelihood function via the effective matrices appearing in quantum smoothing and solutions of the adjoint quantum filter . it allows to retrieve the initial quantum state as in standard maxlike tomography , but where the traditional povm operators are replaced by more general ones that depend on the measurement record of each trajectory . it also provides , aside the maxlike estimate of the quantum state , confidence intervals for any observable . such confidence intervals are derived , as the maxlike estimate , from an asymptotic expansion of multi - dimensional laplace integrals appearing in bayesian mean estimation . a validation is performed on two sets of experimental data : photon(s ) trapped in a microwave cavity subject to quantum non - demolition measurements relying on rydberg atoms ; heterodyne fluorescence measurements of a superconducting qubit .
