we consider the relation of mixed global gauge gravitational anomalies and boundary conformal field theory in wzw models for simple lie groups . the discrete symmetries of consideration are the centers of the simple lie groups . these mixed anomalies prevent to gauge them i.e , take the orbifold by the center . the absence of anomalies impose conditions on the levels of wzw models . next , we study the conformal boundary conditions for the original theories . we consider the existence of a conformal boundary state invariant under the action of the center . this also gives conditions on the levels of wzw models . by considering the combined action of the center and charge conjugation on boundary states , we reproduce the condition obtained in the orbifold analysis .
