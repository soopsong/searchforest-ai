supersymmetry - breaking is a key ingredient for string theory models to be phenomenologically viable . we review the strong analogy in the physics and the methods used for describing non - supersymmetric flux vacua and non - supersymmetric black holes in string theory . we also show how the polarized state could be the key to describing a well - behaved back - reaction of anti - branes in flux backgrounds , shedding a new light on a recent debate in the literature .
