the linewidth of an atom laser is limited by density fluctuations in the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) from which the atom laser beam is outcoupled . in this paper we show that a stable spatial mode for an interacting bec can be generated using a realistic control scheme that includes the effects of the measurement backaction . this model extends the feedback theory , based on a phase - contrast imaging setup , presented in \cite{szigeti:2009 } . in particular , it is applicable to a bec with large interatomic interactions and solves the problem of inadequacy of the mean - field ( coherent state ) approximation by utilising a fixed number state approximation . our numerical analysis shows the control to be more effective for a condensate with a large nonlinearity .
