continuing our earlier work ( quant - ph/0401060 ) , we give two alternative proofs of the result that a noiseless qubit channel has identification capacity 2 : the first is direct by a"maximal code with random extension"argument , the second is by showing that 1 bit of entanglement ( which can be generated by transmitting 1 qubit ) and negligible ( quantum ) communication has identification capacity 2 . this generalises a random hashing construction of ahlswede and dueck : that 1 shared random bit together with negligible communication has identification capacity 1 . we then apply these results to prove capacity formulas for various quantum feedback channels : passive classical feedback for quantum - classical channels , a feedback model for classical - quantum channels , and"coherent feedback"for general channels .
