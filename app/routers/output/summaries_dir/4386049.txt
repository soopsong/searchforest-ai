in this paper we study the ways to use a global entangling operator to efficiently implement circuitry common to a selection of important quantum algorithms . in particular , we focus on the circuits composed with global ising entangling gates and arbitrary addressable single - qubit gates . we show that under certain circumstances the use of global operations can substantially improve the entangling gate count .
