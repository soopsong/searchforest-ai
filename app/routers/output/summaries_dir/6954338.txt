we show that an optical vortex beam , implemented classically , can be transferred to the transverse amplitude of a heralded single photon . for this purpose we have relied on the process of spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) for the generation of signal and idler photon pairs , using a pump in the form of a bessel - gauss ( bg ) beam with orbital angular momentum ( specifically , with topological charge l = 1 and l = 2 ) . we have designed our source so that it operates within the short spdc crystal regime for which , the amplitude and phase of the pump may be transferred to a heralded single photon . in order to verify the vortex nature of our heralded single photon , we have shown that the conditional angular spectrum and the transverse intensity at the single - photon level match similar measurements carried out for the pump . in addition , we have shown that when our heralded single photon is diffracted through a triangular aperture , the far - field singlephoton transverse intensity exhibits the expected triangular arrangement of intensity lobes associated with the presence of orbital angular momentum .
