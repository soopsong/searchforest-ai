we propose a simple setup for the conversion of multipartite entangled states in a quantum network with restricted access . the scheme uses nonlocal operations to enable the preparation of states that are inequivalent under local operations and classical communication , but most importantly does not require full access to the states . it is based on a flexible linear optical conversion gate that uses photons , which are ideally suited for distributed quantum computation and quantum communication in extended networks . in order to show the basic working principles of the gate , we focus on converting a four - qubit entangled cluster state to other locally inequivalent four - qubit states , such as the ghz and symmetric dicke state . we also show how the gate can be incorporated into extended graph state networks , and can be used to generate variable entanglement and quantum correlations without entanglement but nonvanishing quantum discord .
