the large number of available orbital angular momentum ( oam ) states of photons provides a unique resource for many important applications in quantum information and optical communications . however , conventional oam switching devices usually rely on precise parameter control and are limited by slow switching rate and low efficiency . here we propose a robust , fast and efficient photonic oam switch device based on a topological process , where photons are adiabatically pumped to a target oam state on demand . such topological oam pumping can be realized through manipulating photons in a few degenerate main cavities and involves only a limited number of optical elements . a large change of oam at $ \sim 10^{q}$ can be realized with only $ q$ degenerate main cavities and at most $ 5q$ pumping cycles . the topological photonic oam switch may become a powerful device for broad applications in many different fields and motivate novel topological design of conventional optical devices .
