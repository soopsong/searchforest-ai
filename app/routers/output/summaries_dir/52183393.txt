the identifiability of a system is concerned with whether the unknown parameters in the system can be uniquely determined with all the possible data generated by a certain experimental setting . a test of quantum hamiltonian identifiability is an important tool to save time and cost when exploring the identification capability of quantum probes and experimentally implementing quantum identification schemes . in this paper , we generalize the identifiability test based on the similarity transformation approach ( sta ) in classical control theory and extend it to the domain of quantum hamiltonian identification . we employ sta to prove the identifiability of spin-1/2 chain systems with arbitrary dimension assisted by single - qubit probes . we further extend the traditional sta method by proposing a structure preserving transformation ( spt ) method for non - minimal systems . we use the spt method to introduce an indicator for the existence of economic quantum hamiltonian identification algorithms , whose computational complexity directly depends on the number of unknown parameters ( which could be much smaller than the system dimension ) . finally , we give an example of such an economic hamiltonian identification algorithm and perform simulations to demonstrate its effectiveness .
