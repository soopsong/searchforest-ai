traditional computational methods for studying quantum many - body systems are"forward methods,"which take quantum models , i.e. , hamiltonians , as input and produce ground states as output . however , such forward methods often limit one 's perspective to a small fraction of the space of possible hamiltonians . we introduce an alternative computational"inverse method,"the eigenstate - to - hamiltonian construction ( ehc ) , that allows us to better understand the vast space of quantum models describing strongly correlated systems . ehc takes as input a wave function $ |\psi_t\rangle$ and produces as output hamiltonians for which $ |\psi_t\rangle$ is an eigenstate . this is accomplished by computing the quantum covariance matrix , a quantum mechanical generalization of a classical covariance matrix . ehc is widely applicable to a number of models and in this work we consider seven different examples . using the ehc method , we construct a parent hamiltonian with a new type of antiferromagnetic ground state , a parent hamiltonian with two different targeted degenerate ground states , and large classes of parent hamiltonians with the same ground states as well - known quantum models , such as the majumdar - ghosh model , the xx chain , the heisenberg chain , the kitaev chain , and a 2d bdg model .
