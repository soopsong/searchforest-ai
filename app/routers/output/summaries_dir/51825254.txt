a discrete - time staggered quantum walk was recently introduced as a generalization that allows to unify other versions , such as the coined and szegedy 's walk . however , it also produces new forms of quantum walks not covered by previous versions . to explore their properties , we study here the staggered walk on a hexagonal lattice . such a walk is defined using a set of overlapping tessellations that cover the graph edges , and each tessellation is a partition of the node set into cliques . the hexagonal lattice requires at least three tessellations . each tessellation is associated with a local unitary operator and the product of the local operators defines the evolution operator of the staggered walk on the graph . after defining the evolution operator on the hexagonal lattice , we analyze the quantum walk dynamics with the focus on the position standard deviation and localization . we also obtain analytic results for the time complexity of spatial search algorithms with one marked node using cyclic boundary conditions .
