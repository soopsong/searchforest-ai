we present a microfabricated surface - electrode ion trap with a pair of integrated waveguides that generate a standing microwave field resonant with the 171yb+ hyperfine qubit . the waveguides are engineered to position the wave antinode near the center of the trap , resulting in maximum field amplitude and uniformity along the trap axis . by calibrating the relative amplitudes and phases of the waveguide currents , we can control the polarization of the microwave field to reduce off - resonant coupling to undesired zeeman sublevels . we demonstrate single - qubit pi - rotations as fast as 1 us with less than 6 % variation in rabi frequency over an 800 um microwave interaction region . fully compensating pulse sequences further improve the uniformity of x - gates across this interaction region .
