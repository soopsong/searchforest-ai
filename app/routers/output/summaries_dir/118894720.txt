a $ d$-dimensional markovian open quantum system will undergo stochastic evolution which preserves pure states , if one monitors without loss of information the bath to which it is coupled . if a finite ensemble of pure states satisfies a particular set of constraint equations then it is possible to perform the monitoring in such a way that the ( discontinuous ) trajectory of the conditioned system state is , at all long times , restricted to those pure states . finding these physically realizable ensembles ( pres ) is typically very difficult , even numerically , when the system dimension is larger than 2 . in this paper , we develop symmetry - based techniques that potentially greatly reduce the difficulty of finding a subset of all possible pres . the two dynamical symmetries considered are an invariant subspace and a wigner symmetry . an analysis of previously known pres using the developed techniques provides us with new insights and lays the foundation for future studies of higher dimensional systems .
