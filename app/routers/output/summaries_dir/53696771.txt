we propose a realization of a charge parity meter based on two double quantum dots alongside a quantum point contact . such a device is a specific example of the general class of mesoscopic quadratic quantum measurement detectors previously investigated by mao et al . [ phys . rev . lett . 93 , 056803 ( 2004 ) ] . our setup accomplishes entangled state preparation by a current measurement alone , and allows the qubits to be effectively decoupled by pinching off the parity meter . two applications of the parity meter are discussed : the measurement of bell 's inequality in charge qubits and the realization of a controlled not gate .
