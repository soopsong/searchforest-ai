the power of quantum computers is still somewhat speculative . although they are certainly faster than classical ones at some tasks , the class of problems they can efficiently solve has not been mapped definitively onto known classical complexity theory . this means that we do not know for which calculations there will be a ` ` quantum advantage , ' ' once an algorithm is found . one way to answer the question is to find those algorithms , but finding truly quantum algorithms turns out to be very difficult . in previous work , over the past three decades , we have pursued the idea of using techniques of machine learning to develop algorithms for quantum computing . here , we compare the performance of standard real- and complex - valued classical neural networks with that of one of our models for a quantum neural network , on both classical problems and on an archetypal quantum problem : the computation of an entanglement witness . the quantum network is shown to need far fewer epochs and a much smaller network to achieve comparable or better results .
