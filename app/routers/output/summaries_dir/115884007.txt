ultracold atoms in an ultrahigh - finesse optical cavity are a powerful platform to produce spin squeezing since photon of cavity mode can induce nonlinear spin - spin interaction and thus generate a one - axis twisting hamiltonian $ h_{\text{oat}}=qj_{x}^{2}$ , whose corresponding maximal squeezing factor scales as $ n^{-2/3}$ , where $ n$ is the atomic number . on the contrary , for the other two - axis twisting hamiltonian $ h_{\text{tat}}=q(j_{x}^{2}-j_{y}^{2})$ , the maximal squeezing factor scales as $ n^{-1}$ , approaching the heisenberg limit . in this paper , inspired by recent experiments of cavity - assisted raman transitions , we propose a scheme , in which an ensemble of ultracold six - level atoms interacts with two quantized cavity fields and two pairs of raman lasers , to realize a tunable two - axis spin hamiltonian $ % h = q(j_{x}^{2}+\chi j_{y}^{2})+\omega_{0}j_{z}$. for proper parameters , the above one- and two- axis twisting hamiltonians are recovered , and the scaling of $ n^{-1}$ of the maximal squeezing factor can occur naturally . on the other hand , in the two - axis twisting hamiltonian , spin squeezing is usually reduced when increasing the effective atomic resonant frequency $ \omega_{0}$. surprisingly , we find that by combined with the dimensionless parameter $ \chi(>-1)$ , the effective atomic resonant frequency $ \omega_{0}$ can enhance spin squeezing largely . these results are benefit for achieving the required spin squeezing in experiments .
