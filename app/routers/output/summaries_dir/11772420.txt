we provide a compendium of inequalities between several quantum state distinguishability measures . for each measure these inequalities consist of the sharpest possible upper and lower bounds in terms of another measure . some of these inequalities are already known , but new or more general proofs are given , whereas other inequalities are new . we also supply cases of equality to show that all inequalities are indeed the sharpest possible .
