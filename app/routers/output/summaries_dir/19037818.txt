in this paper we study and design quasi-2d optomechanical crystals , waveguides , and resonant cavities formed from patterned slabs . two - dimensional periodicity allows for in - plane pseudo - bandgaps in frequency where resonant optical and mechanical excitations localized to the slab are forbidden . by tailoring the unit cell geometry , we show that it is possible to have a slab crystal with simultaneous optical and mechanical pseudo - bandgaps , and for which optical waveguiding is not compromised . we then use these crystals to design optomechanical cavities in which strongly interacting , co - localized photonic - phononic resonances occur . a resonant cavity structure formed by perturbing a"linear defect"waveguide of optical and acoustic waves in a silicon optomechanical crystal slab is shown to support an optical resonance at wavelength 1.5 micron and a mechanical resonance of frequency 9.5 ghz . these resonances , due to the simultaneous pseudo - bandgap of the waveguide structure , are simulated to have optical and mechanical radiation - limited q - factors greater than 10 ^ 7 . the optomechanical coupling of the optical and acoustic resonances in this cavity due to radiation pressure is also studied , with a quantum conversion rate , corresponding to the scattering rate of a single cavity photon via a single cavity phonon , calculated to be 292 khz .
