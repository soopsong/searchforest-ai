the realization of an elementary quantum network that is intrinsically secure and operates over long distances requires the interconnection of several quantum modules performing different tasks . in this work we report the interconnection of four different quantum modules : ( i ) a random polarization qubit generator , ( ii ) a free - space quantum communication channel , ( iii ) an ultra - low noise portable quantum memory and ( iv ) a qubit decoder , in a functional elementary quantum network possessing all capabilities needed for quantum information distribution protocols . we create weak coherent pulses at the single photon level encoding polarization states $ |h\rangle , |v\rangle , |d\rangle , |a\rangle$ in a randomized sequence . the random qubits are sent over a free - space link and coupled into a dual rail room temperature quantum memory and after storage and retrieval are analyzed in a four detector polarization analysis akin to the requirements of the bb84 protocol . we also show ultra - low noise and fully - portable operation , paving the way towards memory assisted all - environment free space quantum cryptographic networks .
