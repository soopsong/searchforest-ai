we study the generation of entanglement between two distant qubits mediated by the surface plasmons of a metallic waveguide . we show that a v - shaped channel milled in a flat metallic surface is much more efficient for this purpose than a metallic cylinder . the role of the misalignments of the dipole moments of the qubits , an aspect of great importance for experimental implementations , is also studied . a careful analysis of the quantum - dynamics of the system by means of a master equation shows that two - qubit entanglement generation is essentially due to the dissipative part of the effective qubit - qubit coupling provided by the surface plasmons . the influence of a coherent external pumping , needed to achieve a steady state entanglement , is discussed . finally , we pay attention to the question of how to get information experimentally on the degree of entanglement achieved in the system .
