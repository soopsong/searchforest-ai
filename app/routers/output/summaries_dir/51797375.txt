we present the basic ingredients of continuum optomechanics , i.e. the suitable extension of cavity - optomechanical concepts to the interaction of photons and phonons in an extended waveguide . we introduce a real - space picture and argue which coupling terms may arise in leading order in the spatial derivatives . this picture allows us to discuss quantum noise , dissipation , and the correct boundary conditions at the waveguide entrance . the connections both to optomechanical arrays as well as to the theory of brillouin scattering in waveguides are highlighted . we identify the ' strong coupling regime ' of continuum optomechanics that may be accessible in future experiments .
