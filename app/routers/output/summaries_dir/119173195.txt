steering is a manifestation of quantum correlations that embodies the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) paradox . while there have been recent attempts to quantify steering , continuous variable systems remained elusive . we introduce a steering measure for two - mode continuous variable systems that is valid for arbitrary states . the measure is based on the violation of an optimized variance test for the epr paradox , and admits a computable and experimentally friendly lower bound only depending on the second moments of the state , which reduces to a recently proposed quantifier of steerability by gaussian measurements . we further show that gaussian states are extremal with respect to our measure , minimizing it among all continuous variable states with fixed second moments . as a byproduct of our analysis , we generalize and relate well - known epr - steering criteria . finally an operational interpretation is provided , as the proposed measure is shown to quantify the optimal guaranteed key rate in semi - device independent quantum key distribution .
