we investigate scaling of work and efficiency of a photonic carnot engine with the number of quantum coherent resources . specifically , we consider a generalization of the"phaseonium fuel"for the photonic carnot engine , which was first introduced as a three - level atom with two lower states in a quantum coherent superposition by [ m. o. scully , m. suhail zubairy , g. s. agarwal , and h. walther , science { \bf 299 } , 862 ( 2003 ) ] , to the case of $ n+1 $ level atoms with $ n$ coherent lower levels . we take into account atomic relaxation and dephasing as well as the cavity loss and derive a coarse grained master equation to evaluate the work and efficiency , analytically . analytical results are verified by microscopic numerical examination of the thermalization dynamics . we find that efficiency and work scale quadratically with the number of quantum coherent levels . quantum coherence boost to the specific energy ( work output per unit mass of the resource ) is a profound fundamental difference of quantum fuel from classical resources . we consider typical modern resonator set ups and conclude that multilevel phaseonium fuel can be utilized to overcome the decoherence in available systems . preparation of the atomic coherences and the associated cost of coherence are analyzed and the engine operation within the bounds of the second law is verified . our results bring the photonic carnot engines much closer to the capabilities of current resonator technologies .
