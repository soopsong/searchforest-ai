quantum channels can describe all transformations allowed by quantum mechanics . we provide an explicit universal protocol to construct all possible quantum channels , using a single qubit ancilla with quantum non - demolition readout and adaptive control . our construction is efficient in both physical resources and circuit depth , and can be demonstrated using superconducting circuits and various other physical platforms . there are many applications of quantum channel construction , including system stabilization and quantum error correction , markovian and exotic channel simulation , implementation of generalized quantum measurements and more general quantum instruments . efficient construction of arbitrary quantum channels opens up exciting new possibilities for quantum control , quantum sensing and information processing tasks .
