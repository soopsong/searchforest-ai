we study generation and dynamics of an exchange spin qubit encoded in three coherently coupled quantum dots with three electrons . for two geometries of the system a linear and a triangular one , the creation and coherent control of the qubit states are performed by the landau -- zener transitions . in the triangular case both the qubit states are equivalent and can be easily generated for particular symmetries of the system . if one of the dots is smaller than the others one can observe rabi oscillations , that can be used for coherent manipulation of the qubit states . the linear system is easier to fabricate ; however , then the qubit states are not equivalent , making qubit operations more difficult to control .
