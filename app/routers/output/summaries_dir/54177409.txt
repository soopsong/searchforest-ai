the inherent coupling of optical and mechanical modes in high finesse optical microresonators provide a natural , highly sensitive transduction mechanism for micromechanical vibrations . using homodyne and polarization spectroscopy techniques , we achieve shot - noise limited displacement sensitivities of 10^(-19 ) m hz^(-1/2 ) . in an unprecedented manner , this enables the detection and study of a variety of mechanical modes , which are identified as radial breathing , flexural and torsional modes using 3-dimensional finite element modelling . furthermore , a broadband equivalent displacement noise is measured and found to agree well with models for thermorefractive noise in silica dielectric cavities . implications for ground - state cooling , displacement sensing and kerr squeezing are discussed .
