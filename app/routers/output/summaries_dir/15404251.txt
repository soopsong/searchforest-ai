we consider a new quantum gate mechanism based on electron spins in coupled semiconductor quantum dots . such gates provide a general source of spin entanglement and can be used for quantum computers . we determine the exchange coupling j in the effective heisenberg model as a function of magnetic ( b ) and electric fields , and of the inter - dot distance ( a ) within the heitler - london approximation of molecular physics . this result is refined by using sp - hybridization , and by the hund - mulliken molecular - orbit approach which leads to an extended hubbard description for the two - dot system that shows a remarkable dependence on b and a due to the long - range coulomb interaction . we find that the exchange j changes sign at a finite field ( leading to a pronounced jump in the magnetization ) and then decays exponentially . the magnetization and the spin susceptibilities of the coupled dots are calculated . we show that the dephasing due to nuclear spins in gaas can be strongly suppressed by dynamical nuclear spin polarization and/or by magnetic fields .
