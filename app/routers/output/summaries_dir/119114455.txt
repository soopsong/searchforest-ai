a quantum code is a subspace of a hilbert space of a physical system chosen to be correctable against a given class of errors , where information can be encoded . ideally , the quantum code lies within the ground space of the physical system . when the physical model is the heisenberg ferromagnet in the absence of an external magnetic field , the corresponding ground - space contains all permutation - invariant states . we use techniques from combinatorics and operator theory to construct families of permutation - invariant quantum codes . these codes have length proportional to $ t^2 $ ; one family of codes perfectly corrects arbitrary weight $ t$ errors , while the other family of codes approximately correct $ t$ spontaneous decay errors . the analysis of our codes ' performance with respect to spontaneous decay errors utilizes elementary matrix analysis , where we revisit and extend the quantum error correction criterion of knill and laflamme , and leung , chuang , nielsen and yamamoto .
