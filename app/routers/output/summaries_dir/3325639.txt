we demonstrate coupling of magnetically trapped ultracold $ ^87$rb ground state atoms to a coherently driven superconducting coplanar resonator on an integrated atom chip . we measure the microwave field strength in the cavity through observation of the ac shift of the hyperfine transition frequency when the cavity is driven off - resonance from the atomic transition . the measured shifts are used to reconstruct the field in the resonator , in close agreement with transmission measurements of the cavity , giving proof of the coupling between atoms and resonator . when driving the cavity in resonance with the atoms , we observe rabi oscillations between atomic hyperfine states , demonstrating coherent control of the atomic states through the cavity field . the observation of two - photon rabi oscillations using an additional external radio frequency enables the preparation of magnetically trapped coherent superposition states near the superconducting cavity , which are required for the implementation of an atomic quantum memory .
