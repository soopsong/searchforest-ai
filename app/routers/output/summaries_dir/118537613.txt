in this paper we present a new method for entanglement witnesses construction . we show that to construct such an object we can deal with maps which are not positive on the whole domain , but only on a certain sub - domain . in our approach crucial role play such maps which are surjective between sets $ \mathcal{p}_{k}^d$ of $ k \leq d$ rank projectors and the set $ \mathcal{p}_1^d$ of rank one projectors acting in the $ d$ dimensional space . we argue that our method can be used to check whether a given observable is an entanglement witness . in the second part of this paper we show that inverse reduction map satisfies this requirement and using it we can obtain a bunch of new entanglement witnesses .
