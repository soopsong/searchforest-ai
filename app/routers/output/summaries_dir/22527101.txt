for more than 50 years we have known that photosynthetic systems harvest solar energy with almost unit { \it quantum efficiency } . however , recent experimental evidence of { \it quantum coherence } during the excitonic energy transport in photosynthetic organisms challenges our understanding of this fundamental biological function . currently , and despite numerous efforts , the causal connection between coherence and efficiency is still a matter of debate . we show , through the study of extensive simulations of quantum coherent transport on networks , that three dimensional structures characterized by centro - symmetric hamiltonians are statistically more efficient than random arrangements . moreover , we demonstrate that the experimental data available for the electronic hamiltonians of the fenna - mathew - olson ( fmo ) complex of sulfur bacteria and of the crypophyte pc645 complex of marine algae are consistent with this strong correlation of centro - symmetry with quantum efficiency . these results show that what appears to be geometrically disordered complexes may well exhibit a hidden symmetry which enhances the energy transport between chromophores . we are confident that our results will motivate research to explore the properties of nearly centro - symmetric hamiltonians in more realistic environments , and to unveil the role of symmetries for quantum effects in biology . the unravelling of such symmetries may open novel perspectives and suggest new design principles in the development of artificial devices .
