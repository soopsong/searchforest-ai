we present a theoretical analysis of the electron spin decoherence in single nitrogen - vacancy defects in ultra - pure diamond . the electron spin decoherence is due to the interactions with carbon-13 nuclear spins in the diamond lattice . our approach takes advantage of the low concentration ( 1.1 % ) of carbon-13 and their random distribution in the diamond lattice by an algorithmic aggregation of spins into small , strongly interacting groups . by making use of this \emph{disjoint cluster } approach , we demonstrate a possibility of non - trival dynamics of the electron spin that can not be described by a single time constant . this dependance is caused by a strong coupling between the electron and few nuclei and results , in particular , in a substantial echo signal even at microsecond time scales . our results are in good agreement with recent experimental observations .
