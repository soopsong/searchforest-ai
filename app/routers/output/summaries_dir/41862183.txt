when analyzing the perception of hawking radiation by different observers , the hawking effect becomes mixed with the unruh effect . the separation of both effects is not always clear in the literature . here we propose an inconsistency - free interpretation of what constitutes a hawking effect and what an unruh effect . an appropriate interpretation is important in order to elucidate what sort of effects a detector might experience depending on its trajectory and the state of the quantum field . under simplifying assumptions we introduce an analytic formula that separates these two effects . armed with the previous interpretation we argue that for a free - falling detector to cross the horizon without experiencing high - energy effects , it is necessary that the horizon crossing is not attempted at low velocities .
