we report an experiment demonstrating quantum frequency conversion of weak light pulses compatible with atomic quantum memories to telecommunication wavelengths . we use a ppln nonlinear waveguide to convert weak coherent states at the single photon level with a duration of 30ns from a wavelength of 780 nm to 1552 nm . we measure a maximal waveguide internal ( external ) conversion efficiency eta_int = 0.41 ( eta_ext = 0.25 ) , and we show that the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) is good enough to reduce the input photon number below 1 . in addition , we show that the noise generated by the pump beam in the crystal is proportional to the spectral bandwidth of the device , suggesting that narrower filtering could significantly increase the snr . finally , we demonstrate that the quantum frequency converter can operate in the quantum regime by converting a time - bin qubit and measuring the qubit fidelity after conversion .
