mutually unbiased bases that can be cyclically generated by a single unitary operator are of special interest , since they can be readily implemented in practice . we show that , for a system of qubits , finding such a generator can be cast as the problem of finding a symmetric matrix over the field $ \mathbb{f}_2 $ equipped with an irreducible characteristic polynomial of a given fibonacci index . the entanglement structure of the resulting complete sets is determined by two additive matrices of the same size .
