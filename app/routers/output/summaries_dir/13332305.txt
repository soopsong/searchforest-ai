entanglement of a quantum system depends upon relative phase in complicated ways , which no single measurement can reflect . because of this , entanglement witnesses are necessarily limited in applicability and/or utility . we propose here a solution to the problem using quantum neural networks . a quantum system contains the information of its entanglement ; thus , if we are clever , we can extract that information efficiently . as proof of concept , we show how this can be done for the case of pure states of a two - qubit system , using an entanglement indicator corrected for the anomalous phase oscillation . both the entanglement indicator and the phase correction are calculated by the quantum system itself acting as a neural network .
