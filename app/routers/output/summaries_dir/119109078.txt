the occurrence of revivals of quantum entanglement between separated open quantum systems has been shown not only for dissipative non - markovian quantum environments but also for classical environments in absence of back - action . while the phenomenon is well understood in the first case , the possibility to retrieve entanglement when the composite quantum system is subject to local classical noise has generated a debate regarding its interpretation . this dynamical property of open quantum systems assumes an important role in quantum information theory from both fundamental and practical perspectives . hybrid quantum - classical systems are in fact promising candidates to investigate the interplay among quantum and classical features and to look for possible control strategies of a quantum system by means of a classical device . here we present an overview on this topic , reporting the most recent theoretical and experimental results about the revivals of entanglement between two qubits locally interacting with classical environments . we also review and discuss the interpretations provided so far to explain this phenomenon , suggesting that they can be cast under a unified viewpoint .
