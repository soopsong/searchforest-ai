the growing requirement for photon pairs with specific spectral correlations in quantum optics experiments has created a demand for fast , high resolution and accurate source characterization . a promising tool for such characterization uses the classical stimulated process , in which an additional seed laser stimulates photon generation yielding much higher count rates , as recently demonstrated for a $ \chi^{(2)}$ integrated source in a.~eckstein \emph{et al . } , laser photon . rev . \textbf{8 } , l76 ( 2014 ) . in this work we extend these results to $ \chi^{(3)}$ sources , demonstrating spectral correlation measurements via stimulated four - wave mixing for the first time in a integrated optical waveguide , namely a silicon nanowire . we directly confirm the speed - up due to higher count rates and demonstrate that additional resolution can be gained when compared to traditional coincidence measurements . as pump pulse duration can influence the degree of spectral entanglement , all of our measurements are taken for two different pump pulse widths . this allows us to confirm that the classical stimulated process correctly captures the degree of spectral entanglement regardless of pump pulse duration , and cements its place as an essential characterization method for the development of future quantum integrated devices .
