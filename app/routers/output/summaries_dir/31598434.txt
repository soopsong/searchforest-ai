motivated by transitionless quantum driving , we construct shortcuts to adiabatic passage in a three - atom system to create a singlet state with the help of quantum zeno dynamics and non - resonant lasers . the influence of various decoherence processes is discussed by numerical simulation and the results reveal that the scheme is fast and robust against decoherence and operational imperfection . we also investigate how to select the experimental parameters to control the cavity dissipation and atomic spontaneous emission which will have an application value in experiment .
