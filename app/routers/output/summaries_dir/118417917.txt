we analyse the response function of an unruh -- dewitt detector moving with time - dependent acceleration along a one - dimensional trajectory in minkowski spacetime . to extract the physics of the process , we propose an adiabatic expansion of this response function . this expansion is also a useful tool for computing the click rate of detectors in general trajectories . the expansion is done in powers of the time derivatives of the acceleration ( jerk , snap , and higher derivatives ) . at the lowest order , we recover a planckian spectrum with temperature proportional to the acceleration of the detector at each instant of the trajectory . higher orders in the expansion involve powers of the derivatives of the acceleration , with well - behaved spectral coefficients with different shapes . finally , we illustrate this analysis in the case of an initially inertial trajectory that acquires a given constant acceleration in a finite time .
