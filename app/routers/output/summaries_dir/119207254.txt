we study the optical bistability of an optomechanical system in which the position of a mechanical oscillator modulates the cavity frequency . the steady - state mean - field equation of the optical mode is identical to the one for a kerr medium , and thus we expect it to have the same characteristic behavior with a lower , a middle , and an upper branch . however , the presence of position fluctuations of the mechanical resonator leads to a new feature : the upper branch will become unstable at sufficiently strong driving in certain parameter regimes . we identify the appropriate parameter regime for the upper branch to be stable , and we confirm , by numerical investigation of the quantum steady state , that the mechanical mode indeed acts as a kerr nonlinearity for the optical mode in the low - temperature limit . this equivalence of the optomechanical system and the kerr medium will be important for future applications of cavity optomechanics in quantum nonlinear optics and quantum information science .
