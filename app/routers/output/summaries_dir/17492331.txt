we consider a system composed of two qubits and a high - excitation - energy quantum object used to mediate coupling between the qubits . we treat the entire system quantum mechanically and analyze the properties of the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the total hamiltonian . after reproducing well - known results concerning the leading term in the mediated coupling , we obtain an expression for the residual coupling between the qubits in the off state . we also analyze the entanglement between the three objects , i.e. the two qubits and the coupler , in the eigenstates of the total hamiltonian . although we focus on the application of our results to the recently realized parametric - coupling scheme with two qubits , we also discuss extensions of our results to harmonic - oscillator couplers , couplers that are near resonance with the qubits and multi - qubit systems . in particular , we find that certain errors that are absent for a two - qubit system arise when dealing with multi - qubit systems .
