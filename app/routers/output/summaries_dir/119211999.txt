we investigate quantum entanglement between two symmetric spatialregions in de sitter space with the bunch - davies vacuum . as a discretized model of the scalar field for numerical simulation , we consider a harmonic chain model . using the coarse - grained variables for the scalar field , it is shown that the multipartite entanglement on the superhorizon scale exists by checking the monogamy relation for the negativity which quantifies the entanglement between the two regions . further , we consider the continuous limit of this model without coarse - graining and find that non - zero values of the logarithmic negativity exist even if the distance between two spatial regions is larger than the hubble horizon scale .
