the tunability of an optical cavity is an essential requirement for many areas of research . here , we use the pound - drever - hall technique to lock a laser to a whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) of a microbubble resonator , to show that linear tuning of the wgm , and the corresponding locked laser , display almost zero hysteresis . by applying aerostatic pressure to the interior surface of the microbubble resonator , optical mode shift rates of around $ 58 $ ghz / mpa are achieved . the microbubble can measure pressure with a detection limit of $ 2\times 10^{-4}$ mpa , which is an improvement made on pressure sensing using this device . the long - term frequency stability of this tuning method for different input pressures is measured . the frequency noise of the wgm measured over $ 10 $ minutes for an input pressure of $ 0.5 $ mpa , has a maximum standard deviation of $ 36 $ mhz .
