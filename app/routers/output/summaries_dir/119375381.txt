we present a way for symmetric multiparty - controlled teleportation of an arbitrary two - particle entangled state based on bell - basis measurements by using two greenberger - horne - zeilinger states , i.e. , a sender transmits an arbitrary two - particle entangled state to a distant receiver , an arbitrary one of the $ n+1 $ agents via the control of the others in a network . it will be shown that the outcomes in the cases that $ n$ is odd or it is even are different in principle as the receiver has to perform a controlled - not operation on his particles for reconstructing the original arbitrary entangled state in addition to some local unitary operations in the former . also we discuss the applications of this controlled teleporation for quantum secret sharing of classical and quantum information . as all the instances can be used to carry useful information , its efficiency for qubits approaches the maximal value .
