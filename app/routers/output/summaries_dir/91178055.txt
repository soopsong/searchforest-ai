we study the quantum transport of multi - photon fock states in one - dimensional bose - hubbard lattices implemented in qed cavity arrays ( qcas ) . we propose an optical scheme to probe the underlying many - body states of the system by analyzing the properties of the transmitted light using scattering theory . to this end , we employ the lippmann - schwinger formalism within which an analytical form of the scattering matrix can be found . the latter is evaluated explicitly for the two particle / photon - two site case using which we study the resonance properties of two - photon scattering , as well as the scattering probabilities and the second - order intensity correlations of the transmitted light . the results indicate that the underlying structure of the many - body states of the model in question can be directly inferred from the physical properties of the transported photons in its qca realization . we find that a fully - resonant two - photon scattering scenario allows a faithful characterization of the underlying many - body states , unlike in the coherent driving scenario usually employed in quantum master equation treatments . the effects of losses in the cavities , as well as the incoming photons ' pulse shapes and initial correlations are studied and analyzed . our method is general and can be applied to probe the structure of any many - body bosonic models amenable to a qca implementation including the jaynes - cummings - hubbard , the extended bose - hubbard as well as a whole range of spin models .
