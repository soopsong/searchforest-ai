we apply covert quantum communication based on entanglement generated from the minkowski vacuum to the setting of quantum computation and quantum networks . our approach hides the generation and distribution of entanglement in quantum networks by taking advantage of relativistic quantum effects . we devise a suite of covert quantum teleportation protocols that utilize the shared entanglement , local operations , and covert classical communication to transfer or process quantum information in stealth . as an application of our covert suite , we construct two prominent examples of measurement - based quantum computation , namely the teleportation - based quantum computer and the one - way quantum computer . in the latter case we explore the covert generation of graph states , and subsequently outline a protocol for the covert implementation of universal blind quantum computation .
