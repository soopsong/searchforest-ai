we consider a generalization of the quantum rabi model where the two - level system and the single - mode cavity oscillator are coupled by an additional stark - like term . by adapting a method recently introduced by braak [ phys . rev . lett . { \bf 107 } , 100401 ( 2011 ) ] , we solve the model exactly . the low - lying spectrum in the experimentally relevant ultrastrong and deep strong regimes of the rabi coupling is found to exhibit two striking features absent from the original quantum rabi model : avoided level crossings for states of the same parity and an anomalously rapid onset of two - fold near - degenerate levels as the rabi coupling increases .
