continuous - variable quantum key distribution ( cv - qkd ) protocols based on coherent detection have been studied extensively in both theory and experiment . in all the existing implementations of cv - qkd , both the quantum signal and the local oscillator ( lo ) are generated from the same laser and propagate through the insecure quantum channel . this arrangement may open security loopholes and also limit the potential applications of cv - qkd . in this paper , we propose and demonstrate a pilot - aided feedforward data recovery scheme which enables reliable coherent detection using a"locally"generated lo . using two independent commercial laser sources and a spool of 25 km optical fiber , we construct a coherent communication system . the variance of the phase noise introduced by the proposed scheme is measured to be 0.04 ( rad^2 ) , which is small enough to enable secure key distribution . this technology also opens the door for other quantum communication protocols , such as the recently proposed measurement - device - independent ( mdi ) cv - qkd where independent light sources are employed by different users .
