at a transition in a wave - guiding structure , part of the incident energy is transmitted and part of the energy is reflected . when the waveguide has non - trivial topological properties , however , the transition may occur with no backscattering , and with unusual modal coupling / transformations . within this context , we discuss the response of a nonreciprocal topological structure composed of two nearby interfaces between oppositely - biased gyrotropic media and an isotropic medium , which support unidirectional surface modes ( topological modes ) . we provide an exact green 's function analysis of this structure , and we discuss how the topological surface modes are modified when the two interfaces are brought closer and eventually merged . we show that the resulting mode conversion is independent of the transition geometry .
