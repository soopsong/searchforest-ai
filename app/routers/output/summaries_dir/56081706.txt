we investigate a recent development of the black hole information problem , in which a practical paradox has been formulated to show that complementarity is insufficient . a crucial ingredient in this practical paradox is to distill information from the early hawking radiation within the past lightcone of the black hole . by causality this action can back - react on the black hole . taking this back - reaction into account , the paradox could be resolved without invoking any new physics beyond complementarity . this resolution requires a certain constraint on the s - matrix to be satisfied . further insights into the s - matrix could potentially be obtained by effective - field - theory computations of the back - reaction on the nice slice .
