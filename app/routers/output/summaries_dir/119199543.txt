continuous - time quantum walks and adiabatic quantum evolution are two general techniques for quantum computing , both of which are described by hamiltonians that govern their evolutions by schr\"odinger 's equation . in the former , the hamiltonian is fixed , while in the latter , the hamiltonian varies with time . as a result , their formulations of grover 's algorithm evolve differently through hilbert space . we show that this difference is fundamental ; they can not be made to evolve along each other 's path without introducing structure more powerful than the standard oracle for unstructured search . for an adiabatic quantum evolution to evolve like the quantum walk search algorithm , it must interpolate between three fixed hamiltonians , one of which is complex and introduces structure that is stronger than the oracle for unstructured search . conversely , for a quantum walk to evolve along the path of the adiabatic search algorithm , it must be a chiral quantum walk on a weighted , directed star graph with structure that is also stronger than the oracle for unstructured search . thus the two techniques , although similar in being described by hamiltonians that govern their evolution , compute by fundamentally irreconcilable means .
