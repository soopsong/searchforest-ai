when linearly polarized light propagates through a medium in which elliptically polarized light would undergo self - rotation , squeezed vacuum can appear in the orthogonal polarization . a simple relationship between self - rotation and the degree of vacuum squeezing is developed . taking into account absorption , we find the optimum conditions for squeezing in any medium that can produce self - rotation . we then find analytic expressions for the amount of vacuum squeezing produced by an atomic vapor when light is near - resonant with a transition between various low - angular - momentum states . finally , we consider a gas of multi - level rb atoms , and analyze squeezing for light tuned near the d - lines under realistic conditions .
