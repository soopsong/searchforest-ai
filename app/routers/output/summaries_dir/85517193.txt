this paper considers the problem of steering the state distribution of a nonlinear stochastic system from an initial gaussian to a terminal distribution with a specified mean and covariance , subject to probabilistic path constraints . an algorithm is developed to solve this problem by iteratively solving an approximate linearized problem as a convex program . this method , which we call iterative covariance steering ( ics ) , is numerically demonstrated by controlling a double integrator with quadratic drag force subject to additive brownian noise while satisfying probabilistic path constraints .
