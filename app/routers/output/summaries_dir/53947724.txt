the finite dihedral group generated by one rotation and one flip is the simplest case of the non - abelian group . cayley graphs are diagrammatic counterparts of groups . in this paper , much attention is given to the cayley graph of the dihedral group . considering the characteristics of the elements in the dihedral group , we conduct the model of discrete - time quantum walk on the cayley graph of the dihedral group by special coding mode . this construction makes fourier transformation can be used to carry out spectral analysis of the dihedral quantum walk , i.e. the non - abelian case . furthermore , the relation between quantum walk without memory on the cayley graph of the dihedral group and quantum walk with memory on a cycle is discussed , so that we can explore the potential of quantum walks without and with memory . here , the numerical simulation is carried out to verify the theoretical analysis results and other properties of the proposed model are further studied .
