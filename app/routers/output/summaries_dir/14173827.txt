a hierarchy of semidefinite programming ( sdp ) relaxations approximates the global optimum of polynomial optimization problems of noncommuting variables . generating the relaxation , however , is a computationally demanding task , and only problems of commuting variables have efficient generators . we develop an implementation for problems of noncommuting problems that creates the relaxation to be solved by sdpa -- a high - performance solver that runs in a distributed environment . we further exploit the inherent sparsity of optimization problems in quantum physics to reduce the complexity of the resulting relaxations . constrained problems with a relaxation of order two may contain up to a hundred variables . the implementation is available in python . the tool helps solve problems such as finding the ground state energy or testing quantum correlations .
