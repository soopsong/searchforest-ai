multiplicativity of certain maximal p ->q norms of a tensor product of linear maps on matrix algebras is proved in situations in which the condition of complete positivity ( cp ) is either augmented by , or replaced by , the requirement that the entries of a matrix representative of the map are non - negative ( ep ) . in particular , for integer t , multiplicativity holds for the maximal 2 ->2 t norm of a product of two maps , whenever one of the pair is ep ; for the maximal 1 ->t norm for pairs of cp maps when one of them is also ep ; and for the maximal 1 ->2 t norm for the product of an ep and a 2-positive map . similar results are shown in the infinite - dimensional setting of convolution operators on l^2(r ) , with the pointwise positivity of an integral kernel replacing entrywise positivity of a matrix . these results apply in particular to gaussian bosonic channels .
