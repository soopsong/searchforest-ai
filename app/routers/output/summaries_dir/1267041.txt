we present here algorithmic cooling ( via polarization - heat - bath)- a powerful method for obtaining a large number of highly polarized spins in liquid nuclear - spin systems at finite temperature . given that spin - half states represent ( quantum ) bits , algorithmic cooling cleans dirty bits beyond the shannon 's bound on data compression , by employing a set of rapidly thermal - relaxing bits . such auxiliary bits could be implemented using spins that rapidly get into thermal equilibrium with the environment , e.g. , electron spins . cooling spins to a very low temperature without cooling the environment could lead to a breakthrough in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments , and our ` ` spin - refrigerating ' ' method suggests that this is possible . the scaling of nmr ensemble computers is probably the main obstacle to building useful quantum computing devices , and our spin - refrigerating method suggests that this problem can be resolved .
