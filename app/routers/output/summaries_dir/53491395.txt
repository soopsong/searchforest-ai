there are a number of different strategies to measure the phase shift between two pathways of light more efficiently than suggested by the standard quantum limit . one way is to use highly entangled photons . another way is to expose photons to a non - linear or interacting hamiltonian . this paper emphasises that the conditional dynamics of open quantum systems provides an interesting additional tool for quantum - enhanced metrology . as a concrete example , we review a recent scheme which exploits the conditional dynamics of a laser - driven optical cavity with spontaneous photon emission inside a quantum feedback loop . deducing information from second - order photon correlation measurements requires neither optical non - linearities nor entangled photons and should therefore be of immediate practical interest .
