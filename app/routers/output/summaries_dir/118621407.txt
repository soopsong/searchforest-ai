we use a string of confined $ ^{40}$ca$^+$ ions to measure perturbations to a trapping potential which are caused by light - induced charging of an anti - reflection coated window and of insulating patches on the ion - trap electrodes . the electric fields induced at the ions ' position are characterised as a function of distance to the dielectric , and as a function of the incident optical power and wavelength . the measurement of the ion - string position is sensitive to as few as $ 40 $ elementary charges per $ \sqrt{\mathrm{hz}}$ on the dielectric at distances of order millimetres , and perturbations are observed for illumination with light of wavelengths as long as 729\,nm . this has important implications for the future of miniaturised ion - trap experiments , notably with regards to the choice of electrode material , and the optics that must be integrated in the vicinity of the ion . the method presented can be readily applied to the investigation of charging effects beyond the context of ion trap experiments .
