recently , two quantifications for nonclassicality of a single - mode field are shown to be equivalent ; ( i ) the rank of entanglement it can generate by a beam - splitter and ( ii ) the number of terms needed to expand it as superposition of coherent states . we show that nonclassicality criteria can be obtained with an alternative approach . the rank of two - mode entanglement among 2-level identical particles converges to the rank of single - mode nonclassicality within the holstein - primakoff transformation , at the large particle number limit . in particular , we show that the entanglement criterion of hillery&zubairy converges to the mandel 's $ q$-parameter which is used to reveal nonclassicality , and spin - squeezing criterion of s{\o}rensen et al . converges to single - mode squeezing condition . we obtain additional nonclassicality criteria not existing in the literature . we also discuss if single - mode nonclassicality can be visualized as the entanglement of space generating the photons . moreover , in a forthcoming study we show that , linear optical response of an optomechanical cavity becomes noncausal above the critical coupling where output single - mode field becomes nonclassical .
