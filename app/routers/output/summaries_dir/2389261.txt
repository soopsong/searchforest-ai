we first show that the traveling salesman problem in an n - vertex graph with average degree bounded by d can be solved in o*(2^{(1-\eps_d)n } ) time and exponential space for a constant \eps_d depending only on d , where the o*-notation suppresses factors polynomial in the input size . thus , we generalize the recent results of bjorklund et al . [ talg 2012 ] on graphs of bounded degree . then , we move to the problem of counting perfect matchings in a graph . we first present a simple algorithm for counting perfect matchings in an n - vertex graph in o*(2^{n/2 } ) time and polynomial space ; our algorithm matches the complexity bounds of the algorithm of bjorklund [ soda 2012 ] , but relies on inclusion - exclusion principle instead of algebraic transformations . building upon this result , we show that the number of perfect matchings in an n - vertex graph with average degree bounded by d can be computed in o*(2^{(1-\eps_{2d})n/2 } ) time and exponential space , where \eps_{2d } is the constant obtained by us for the traveling salesman problem in graphs of average degree at most 2d . moreover we obtain a simple algorithm that counts the number of perfect matchings in an n - vertex bipartite graph of average degree at most d in o*(2^{(1 - 1/(3.55d))n/2 } ) time , improving and simplifying the recent result of izumi and wadayama [ focs 2012 ] .
