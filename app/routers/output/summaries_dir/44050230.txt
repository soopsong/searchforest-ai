we demonstrate einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) entanglement by detecting purely spatial quantum correlations in the near and far fields of spontaneous parametric down - conversion generated in a type-2 beta barium borate crystal . full - field imaging is performed in the photon - counting regime with an electron - multiplying ccd camera . the data are used without any postselection , and we obtain a violation of heisenberg inequalities with inferred quantities taking into account all the biphoton pairs in both the near and far fields by integration on the entire two - dimensional transverse planes . this ensures a rigorous demonstration of the epr paradox in its original position momentum form .
