quantum scissors device of pegg et al . ( 1998 phys . rev . lett . 81 , 1604 ) enables truncation of the fock - state expansion of an input optical field to qubit and qutrit ( three - dimensional ) states only . here , a generalized scissors device is proposed using an eight - port optical interferometer . upon post - selection based on photon counting results , the interferometer implements generation and teleportation of qudit ( d - dimensional ) states by truncation of an input field at the ( d-1)th term of its fock - state expansion up to d=6 . examples of selective truncations , which can be interpreted as a fock - state filtering and hole burning in the fock space of an input optical field , are discussed . deterioration of the truncation due to imperfect photon counting is discussed including inefficiency , dark counts and realistic photon - number resolutions of photodetectors .
