deterministic light - induced spin squeezing in an atomic gas is limited by photon shot noise or , equivalently , by atomic state information escaping with the light field mediating the effective atom - atom interaction . we show theoretically that the performance of cavity spin squeezing [ m.h . schleier - smith , i.d . leroux , and v. vuleti\'{c } , phys . rev . a 81 , 021804(r ) ( 2010 ) ] can be substantially improved by erasing the light - atom entanglement , and propose several methods for doing so . accounting for light scattering into free space , quantum erasure improves the scaling of cavity squeezing from s^(-1/2 ) to s^(-2/3 ) , where s is the total atomic spin .
