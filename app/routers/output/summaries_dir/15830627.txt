we develop a novel method for multiphoton controllable transport between remote resonators . specifically , an auxiliary resonator is used to control the coherent long - range coupling of two spatially separated resonators , mediated by a coupled - resonator chain of arbitrary length . in this manner , an arbitrary multiphoton quantum state can be either transmitted through or reflected off the intermediate chain on demand , with very high fidelity . we find , on using a time - independent perturbative treatment , that quantum information leakage of an arbitrary fock state is limited by two upper bounds , one for the transmitted case and the other for the reflected case . in principle , the two upper bounds can be made arbitrarily small , which is confirmed by numerical simulations .
