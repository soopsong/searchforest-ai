we study a quantum boltzmann - condensation system that describes the evolution of the interaction between a well formed bose - einstein condensate and the quasi - particles cloud . the kinetic model is valid for a dilute regime at which the temperature of the gas is very low compared to the bose - einstein condensation critical temperature . in particular , our system couples the density of the condensate from a gross - pitaevskii type equation to the kinetic equation through the dispersion relation in the kinetic model and the corresponding transition probability rate from pre to post collision momentum states . we rigorously show the following three properties ( 1 ) the well - posedness of the cauchy problem for the system in the case of a radially symmetric initial configuration , ( 2 ) find qualitative properties of the solution such as instantaneous creation of exponential tails and , ( 3 ) prove the uniform condensate stability related to the initial mass ratio between condensed particles and quasi - particles . the stability result from ( 3 ) leads to global in time existence of the initial value problem for the quantum boltzmann - condensation system .
