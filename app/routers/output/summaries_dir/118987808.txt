in this book chapter we review photon echo based schemes for optical quantum memory . we outline the basic principles of the atomic frequency comb ( afc ) , gradient echo memory ( gem ) and rephased amplified spontaneous emission ( rase ) protocols . we describe the properties of the rare - earth ion and gaseous vapours ensembles that have been used to carry out experimental demonstrations . these experiments are then discussed with reference to relevant classical and quantum performance criteria .
