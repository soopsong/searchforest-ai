we present a one - dimensional scattering theory which enables us to describe a wealth of effects arising from the coupling of the motional degree of freedom of scatterers to the electromagnetic field . multiple scattering to all orders is taken into account . the theory is applied to describe the scheme of a fabry - perot resonator with one of its mirrors moving . the friction force , as well as the diffusion , acting on the moving mirror is derived . in the limit of a small reflection coefficient , the same model provides for the description of the mechanical effect of light on an atom moving in front of a mirror .
