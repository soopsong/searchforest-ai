the development of microwave photon detectors is paving the way for a wide range of quantum technologies and fundamental discoveries involving single photons . here , we investigate the photon emission from a microwave cavity and find that distribution of photon waiting times contains information about few - photon processes , which can not easily be extracted from standard correlation measurements . the factorial cumulants of the photon counting statistics are positive at all times , which may be intimately linked with the bosonic quantum nature of the photons . we obtain a simple expression for the rare fluctuations of the photon current , which is helpful in understanding earlier results on heat transport statistics and measurements of work distributions . under non - equilibrium conditions , where a small temperature gradient drives a heat current through the cavity , we formulate a fluctuation - dissipation relation for the heat noise spectra . our work suggests a number of experiments for the near future , and it offers theoretical questions for further investigation .
