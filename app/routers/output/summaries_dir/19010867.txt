a unitary design is a collection of unitary matrices that approximate the entire unitary group , much like a spherical design approximates the entire unit sphere . in this paper , we use irreducible representations of the unitary group to find a general lower bound on the size of a unitary t - design in u(d ) , for any d and t. we also introduce the notion of a unitary code - a subset of u(d ) in which the trace inner product of any pair of matrices is restricted to only a small number of distinct values - and give an upper bound for the size of a code of degree s in u(d ) for any d and s. these bounds can be strengthened when the particular inner product values that occur in the code or design are known . finally , we describe some constructions of designs : we give an upper bound on the size of the smallest weighted unitary t - design in u(d ) , and we catalogue some t - designs that arise from finite groups .
