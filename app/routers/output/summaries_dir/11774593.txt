we describe a novel high aspect ratio radiofrequency linear ion trap geometry that is amenable to modern microfabrication techniques . the ion trap electrode structure consists of a pair of stacked conducting cantilevers resulting in confining fields that take the form of fringe fields from parallel plate capacitors . the confining potentials are modeled both analytically and numerically . this ion trap geometry may form the basis for large scale quantum computers or parallel quadrupole mass spectrometers . pacs : 39.25.+k , 03.67.lx , 07.75.+h , 07.10+cm
