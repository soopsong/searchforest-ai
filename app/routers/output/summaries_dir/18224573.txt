we study an optimal control problem aimed at achieving a desired tradeoff between the network coherence and communication requirements in the distributed controller . our objective is to add a certain number of edges to an undirected network , with a known graph laplacian , in order to optimally enhance closed - loop performance . to promote controller sparsity , we introduce $ \ell_1$-regularization into the optimal $ { \cal h}_2 $ formulation and cast the design problem as a semidefinite program . we derive a lagrange dual , provide interpretation of dual variables , and exploit structure of the optimality conditions for undirected networks to develop customized proximal gradient and newton algorithms that are well - suited for large problems . we illustrate that our algorithms can solve the problems with more than million edges in the controller graph in a few minutes , on a pc . we also exploit structure of connected resistive networks to demonstrate how additional edges can be systematically added in order to minimize the $ { \cal h}_2 $ norm of the closed - loop system .
