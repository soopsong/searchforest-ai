future quantum networks in which superconducting quantum processors are connected via optical links , will require microwave - to - optical photon converters that preserve entanglement . a doubly - resonant electro - optic modulator ( eom ) is a promising platform to realize this conversion . here , we present our progress towards building such a modulator by demonstrating the optically - resonant half of the device . we demonstrate high quality factor ring , disk and photonic crystal resonators using a hybrid silicon - on - lithium - niobate material system . optical quality factors up to 730,000 are achieved , corresponding to propagation loss of 0.8 db / cm . we also use the electro - optic effect to modulate the resonance frequency of a photonic crystal cavity , achieving a electro - optic modulation coefficient between 1 and 2 pm / v . in addition to quantum technology , we expect that our results will be useful both in traditional silicon photonics applications and in high - sensitivity acousto - optic devices .
