for some crystalline materials , a regime can be found where continuous ductile cutting is feasible . using precision diamond turning , such materials can be cut into complex optical components with high surface quality and form accuracy . in this work we use diamond - turning to machine a monolithic , square - shaped , doubly - resonant $ linbo_3 $ cavity with two flat and two convex facets . when additional mild polishing is implemented , the q - factor of the resonator is found to be limited only by the material absorption loss . we show how our monolithic square resonator may be operated as an optical parametric oscillator that is evanescently coupled to free - space beams via birefringent prisms . the prism arrangement allows for independent and large tuning of the fundamental and second harmonic coupling rates . we measure $ 2.6\pm0.5 $ db of vacuum squeezing at 1064 nm using our system . potential improvements to obtain higher degrees of squeezing are discussed .
