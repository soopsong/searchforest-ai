we present a simple architecture for deterministic quantum circuits operating on single photon qubits . few resources are necessary to implement two elementary gates and can be recycled for computing with large numbers of qubits . the deterministic realization of some key multi - qubit gates , such as the fredkin and toffoli gate , is greatly simplified in this approach .
