projective simulation was introduced as a novel approach to artificial intelligence . it involves a deliberation procedure that consists of a random walk on a graph of clips and allows for the learning agent to project itself into the future before committing to an action . here we study and analyze a quantum mechanical version in which the random walk is performed by two kinds of hamiltonians . the first kind is implemented by naively embedding the classical model in a quantum model by turning the clips into qubits . the other allows for storing clips in superpositions of qubits allowing for a potentially purely quantum mechanical learning procedure in which the perception of the environment is purely quantum mechanical but the action is classical . we lastly introduce the concept of interacting projective agents for both the classical and quantum mechanical case .
