we study the entanglement entropy of harmonic oscillators in noncommutative phase space . we propose a new definition of quantum r\'enyi entropy based on wigner functions in noncommutative phase space . using the r\'enyi entropy , we calculate the entanglement entropy of the ground state of the 2d isotropic harmonic oscillators . we find that for some values of the noncommutative parameters , the harmonic oscillators can be entangled in noncommutative phase space . this is a new entanglement - like effect caused by the noncommutativity of the phase space .
