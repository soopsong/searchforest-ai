we highlight that the robustness and tunability of a bursting model critically relies on currents that provide slow positive feedback to the membrane potential . such currents have the ability of making the total conductance of the circuit negative in a time scale that is termed slow because intermediate between the fast time scale of the spike upstroke and the ultraslow time scale of even slower adaptation currents . we discuss how such currents can be assessed either in voltage - clamp experiments or in computational models . we show that , while frequent in the literature , mathematical and computational models of bursting that lack the slow negative conductance are fragile and rigid . our results suggest that modeling the slow negative conductance of cellular models is important when studying the neuromodulation of rhythmic circuits at any broader scale .
