we propose an efficient strategy to find optimal control functions for state - to - state quantum control problems . our procedure first chooses an input state trajectory , that can realize the desired transformation by adiabatic variation of the system hamiltonian . the shortcut - to - adiabaticity ( sta ) formalism then provides a control hamiltonian that realizes the reference trajectory exactly but on a finite time scale . as the final state is achieved with certainty , we define a cost functional that incorporates the resource requirements and a perturbative expression for robustness . we optimize this functional by systematically varying the reference trajectory . we demonstrate the method by application to population transfer in a laser driven three - level { \lambda}-system , where we find solutions that are fast and robust against perturbations while maintaining a low peak laser power .
