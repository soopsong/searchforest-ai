we propose a method to generate entangled states of the vibrational modes of n membranes which are coupled to a cavity mode via the radiation pressure . using sideband excitations , we show that arbitrary entangled states of vibrational modes of different membranes can be produced in principle by sequentially applying a series of classical pulses with desired frequencies , phases and durations . as examples , we show how to synthesize several typical entangled states , for example , bell states , noon states , ghz states and w states . the environmental effect , information leakage , and experimental feasibility are briefly discussed . our proposal can also be applied to other experimental setups of optomechanical systems , in which many mechanical resonators are coupled to a common sing - mode cavity field via the radiation pressure .
