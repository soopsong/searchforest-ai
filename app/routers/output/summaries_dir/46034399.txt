we show that spin squeezing implies pairwise entanglement for arbitrary symmetric multiqubit states . if the squeezing parameter is less than or equal to 1 , we demonstrate a quantitative relation between the squeezing parameter and the concurrence for the even and odd states . we prove that the even states generated from the initial state with all qubits being spin down , via the one - axis twisting hamiltonian , are spin squeezed if and only if they are pairwise entangled . for the states generated via the one - axis twisting hamiltonian with an external transverse field for any number of qubits greater than 1 or via the two - axis counter - twisting hamiltonian for any even number of qubits , the numerical results suggest that such states are spin squeezed if and only if they are pairwise entangled .
