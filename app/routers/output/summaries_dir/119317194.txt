for disordered harmonic oscillator systems over the $ d$-dimensional lattice , we consider the problem of finding the bipartite entanglement of the uniform ensemble of the energy eigenstates associated with a particular number of modes . such ensemble define a class of mixed , non - gaussian entangled states that are labeled , by the energy of the system , in an increasing order . we develop a novel approach to find the exact logarithmic negativity of this class of states . we also prove entanglement bounds and demonstrate that the low energy states follow an area law .
