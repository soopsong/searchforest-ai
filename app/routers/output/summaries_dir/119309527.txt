we study the real time dynamics of $ n_f$ flavors of fermions coupled to a $ u(1)$ gauge field in $ 2 + 1 $ dimensions to leading order in a $ 1 / n_f$ expansion . for large enough $ n_{f}$ , this is an interacting conformal field theory and describes the low energy properties of the dirac spin liquid . we focus on thermalization and the onset of many - body quantum chaos which can be diagnosed from the growth of initally anti - commuting fermion field operators . we compute such anti - commutators in this gauge theory to leading order in $ 1 / n_f$. we find that the anti - commutator grows exponentially in time and compute the quantum lyapunov exponent . we briefly comment on chaos , locality , and gauge invariance .
