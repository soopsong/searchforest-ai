topological insulators are materials that conduct on the surface and insulate in their interior due to non - trivial topological order . the edge states on the interface between topological ( non - trivial ) and conventional ( trivial ) insulators are topologically protected from scattering due to structural defects and disorders . recently , it was shown that photonic crystals can serve as a platform for realizing a scatter - free propagation of light waves . in conventional photonic crystals , imperfections , structural disorders , and surface roughness lead to significant losses . the breakthrough in overcoming these problems is likely to come from the synergy of the topological photonic crystals and silicon - based photonics technology that enables high integration density , lossless propagation , and immunity to fabrication imperfections . for many applications , reconfigurability and capability to control the propagation of these non - trivial photonic edge states is essential . one way to facilitate such dynamic control is to use liquid crystals , which allow to modify the refractive index with external electric field . here , we demonstrate dynamic control of topological edge states by modifying the refractive index of a liquid crystal background medium . background index is changed depending on the orientation of a liquid crystal , while preserving the topological order of the system . this results in a change of the spectral position of the photonic bandgap and the topologically protected edge states . the proposed concept might be implemented using conventional semiconductor technology , and can be used for robust energy transport in integrated photonic devices , all - optical circuity , and optical communication systems .
