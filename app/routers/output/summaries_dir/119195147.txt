we present two efficient methods for implementing the fredkin gate with atoms separately trapped in an array of three high-$q$ coupled cavities . the first proposal is based on the resonant dynamics , which leads to a fast resonant interaction in a certain subspace while leaving others unchanged , and the second one utilizes a dispersive interaction such that the effective long - distance dipole - dipole interaction between two distributed target qubits is achieved by virtually excited process . both schemes can achieve the standard form of the fredkin gate in a single step without any subsequent single - qubit operation . the effects of decoherence on the performance of the gate are also analyzed in virtue of master equation , and the strictly numerical simulation reveals that the average fidelity of the quantum gate is high .
