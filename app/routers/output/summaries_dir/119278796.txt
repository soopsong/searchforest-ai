algorithmic cooling ( ac ) of spins is potentially the first near - future application of quantum computing devices . straightforward quantum algorithms combined with novel entropy manipulations can result in a method to improve the identification of molecules . we introduce here several new exhaustive cooling algorithms , such as the tribonacci and k - bonacci algorithms . in particular , we present the ` ` all - bonacci ' ' algorithm , which appears to reach the maximal degree of cooling obtainable by the optimal ac approach .
