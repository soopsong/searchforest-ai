a pivotal task in quantum metrology , and quantum parameter estimation in general , is to de- sign schemes that achieve the highest precision with given resources . standard models of quantum metrology usually assume the dynamics is fixed , the highest precision is achieved by preparing the optimal probe states and performing optimal measurements . however , in many practical experimental settings , additional controls are usually available to alter the dynamics . here we propose to use optimal control methods for further improvement on the precision limit of quantum parameter estimation . we show that by exploring the additional degree of freedom offered by the controls higher precision limit can be achieved . in particular we show that the precision limit under the controlled schemes can go beyond the constraints put by the coherent time , which is in contrast to the standard scheme where the precision limit is always bounded by the coherent time .
