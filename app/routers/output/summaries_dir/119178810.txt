we extend the wigner - weyl - moyal phase - space formulation of quantum mechanics to general curved configuration spaces . the underlying phase space is based on the chosen coordinates of the manifold and their canonically conjugate momenta . the resulting wigner function displays the axioms of a quasiprobability distribution , and any weyl - ordered operator gets associated with the corresponding phase - space function , even in the absence of continuous symmetries . the corresponding quantum liouville equation reduces to the classical curved space liouville equation in the semiclassical limit . we demonstrate the formalism for a point particle moving on two - dimensional manifolds , such as a paraboloid or the surface of a sphere . the latter clarifies the treatment of compact coordinate spaces as well as the relation of the presented phase - space representation to symmetry groups of the configuration space .
