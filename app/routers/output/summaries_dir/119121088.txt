a holographic duality is proposed between black hole evaporation in the bulk and hadronization ( confinement ) in dual field theory . information paradox is discussed in this duality . we also propose that the recently introduced semi black brane solution is holographically dual to a mixed plasma of quarks , gluons and hadrons in global equilibrium .
