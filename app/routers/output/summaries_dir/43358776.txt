the direction of the steady - state heat currents across a generic quantum system connected to multiple baths may be engineered so as to realize virtually any thermodynamic cycle . in spite of their versatility such continuous energy - conversion systems are generally unable to operate at maximum efficiency due to non - negligible sources of irreversible entropy production . in this paper we introduce a minimal model of irreversible absorption chiller . we identify and characterize the different mechanisms responsible for its irreversibility , namely heat leaks and internal dissipation , and gauge their relative impact in the overall cooling performance . we also propose reservoir engineering techniques to minimize these detrimental effects . finally , by looking into a known three - qubit embodiment of the absorption cooling cycle , we illustrate how our simple model may help to pinpoint the different sources of irreversibility naturally arising in more complex practical heat devices .
