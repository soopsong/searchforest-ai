we establish a rigorous connection between fundamental resource theories at the quantum scale . correlations and entanglement constitute indispensable resources for numerous quantum information tasks . however , their establishment comes at the cost of energy , the resource of thermodynamics , and is limited by the initial entropy . here , the optimal conversion of energy into correlations is investigated . assuming the presence of a thermal bath , we establish general bounds for arbitrary systems and construct a protocol saturating them . the amount of correlations , quantified by the mutual information , can increase at most linearly with the available energy , and we determine where the linear regime breaks down . we further consider the generation of genuine quantum correlations , focusing on the fundamental constituents of our universe : fermions and bosons . for fermionic modes , we find the optimal entangling protocol . for bosonic modes , we show that while gaussian operations can be outperformed in creating entanglement , their performance is optimal for high energies .
