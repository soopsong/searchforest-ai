we present the analysis of a nonlinear effect of parametric oscillatory instability in power recycled ligo interferometer with fabry - perot cavities in the arms . the basis for this effect is the excitation of the additional stokes optical mode and the mirror elastic mode when the optical energy stored in the main fabry - perot cavity mode exceeds the certain threshold . we demonstrate that in the resonance case the parametric oscillatory instability will take place at the energy stored in the cavity of about five orders smaller than one planned for ligo - ii interferometer . the presence of anti - stokes modes can depress parametric oscillatory instability . however , it is very likely that the anti - stokes modes will not compensate the parametric instability completely because of the existence of the mode combinations which interact with each other quite strongly .
