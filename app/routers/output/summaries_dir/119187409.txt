i propose an archtitecture for the realization of dissipative quantum many - body spin models . the dissipative processes are mediated by interactions with auxiliary particles and lead to a widely tunable class of correlated quantum jump operators . these findings enable the investigation of purely dissipative spin models , where coherent dynamics is entirely absent . i provide a detailed review of a recently introduced variational method to analyze such dissipative quantum many - body systems , and i discuss a specific example in terms of a purely dissipative heisenberg model , for which i find an additional disordered phase that is not present in the corresponding ground state phase diagram .
