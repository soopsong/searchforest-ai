we propose a protocol to perform quantum reinforcement learning with quantum technologies . at variance with recent results on quantum reinforcement learning with superconducting circuits , in our current protocol coherent feedback during the learning process is not required , enabling its implementation in a wide variety of quantum systems . we consider diverse possible scenarios for an agent , an environment , and a register that connects them , involving multiqubit and multilevel systems , as well as open - system dynamics . we finally propose possible implementations of this protocol in trapped ions and superconducting circuits . the field of quantum reinforcement learning with quantum technologies will enable enhanced quantum control , as well as more efficient machine learning calculations .
