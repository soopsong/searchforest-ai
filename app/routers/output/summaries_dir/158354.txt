berry 's approach on"transitionless quantum driving"shows how to set a hamiltonian which drives the dynamics of a system along instantaneous eigenstates of a reference hamiltonian to reproduce the same final result of an adiabatic process in a shorter time . in this paper , motivated by transitionless quantum driving , we construct shortcuts to adiabatic passage in a three - atom system to create the greenberger - horne - zeilinger states with the help of quantum zeno dynamics and of non - resonant lasers . the influence of various decoherence processes is discussed by numerical simulation and the result proves that the scheme is fast and robust against decoherence and operational imperfection .
