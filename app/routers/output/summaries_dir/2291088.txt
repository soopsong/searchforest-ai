using a fermi - bose mixture of ultra - cold atoms in an optical lattice , we construct a quantum simulator for a u(1 ) gauge theory coupled to fermionic matter . the construction is based on quantum links which realize continuous gauge symmetry with discrete quantum variables . at low energies , quantum link models with staggered fermions emerge from a hubbard - type model which can be quantum simulated . this allows us to investigate string breaking as well as the real - time evolution after a quench in gauge theories , which are inaccessible to classical simulation methods .
