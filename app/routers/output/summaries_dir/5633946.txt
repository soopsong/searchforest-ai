some of the most interesting quantities associated with a factor graph are its marginals and its partition sum . for factor graphs \emph{without cycles } and moderate message update complexities , the sum - product algorithm ( spa ) can be used to efficiently compute these quantities exactly . moreover , for various classes of factor graphs \emph{with cycles } , the spa has been successfully applied to efficiently compute good approximations to these quantities . note that in the case of factor graphs with cycles , the local functions are usually non - negative real - valued functions . in this paper we introduce a class of factor graphs , called double - edge factor graphs ( de - fgs ) , which allow local functions to be complex - valued and only require them , in some suitable sense , to be positive semi - definite . we discuss various properties of the spa when running it on de - fgs and we show promising numerical results for various example de - fgs , some of which have connections to quantum information processing .
