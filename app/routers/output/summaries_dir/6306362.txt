in this brief paper , we go through the theoretical steps of the spectral clustering on quantum computers by employing the phase estimation and the amplitude amplification algorithms . we discuss circuit designs for each step and show how to obtain the clustering solution from the output state . in addition , we introduce a biased version of the phase estimation algorithm which significantly speeds up the amplitude amplification process . the complexity of the whole process is analyzed : it is shown that when the circuit representation of a data matrix of order $ n$ is produced through an ancilla based circuit in which the matrix is written as a sum of $ l$ number of householder matrices ; the computational complexity is bounded by $ o(2^mln)$ number of quantum gates . here , $ m$ represents the number of qubits ( e.g. , 6 ) involved in the phase register of the phase estimation algorithm .
