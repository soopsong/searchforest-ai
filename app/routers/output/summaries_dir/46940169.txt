globally - constrained classical fields provide a unexplored framework for modeling quantum phenomena , including apparent particle - like behavior . by allowing controllable constraints on unknown past fields , these models are retrocausal but not retro - signaling , respecting the conventional block universe viewpoint of classical spacetime . several example models are developed that resolve the most essential problems with using classical electromagnetic fields to explain single - photon phenomena . these models share some similarities with stochastic electrodynamics , but without the infinite background energy problem , and with a clear path to explaining entanglement phenomena . intriguingly , the average intermediate field intensities share a surprising connection with quantum"weak values " , even in the single - photon limit . this new class of models is hoped to guide further research into spacetime - based accounts of weak values , entanglement , and other quantum phenomena .
