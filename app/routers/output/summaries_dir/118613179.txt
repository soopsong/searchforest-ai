the dynamical behavior of a coupled cavity array is investigated when each cavity contains a three - level atom . for the uniform and staggered intercavity hopping , the whole system hamiltonian can be analytically diagonalized in the subspace of single - atom excitation . the quantum state transfer along the cavities is analyzed in detail for distinct regimes of parameters , and some interesting phenomena including binary transmission , selective localization of the excitation population are revealed . we demonstrate that the uniform coupling is more suitable for the quantum state transfer . it is shown that the initial state of polariton located in the first cavity is crucial to the transmission fidelity , and the local entanglement depresses the state transfer probability . exploiting the metastable state , the distance of the quantum state transfer can be much longer than that of jaynes - cummings - hubbard model . a higher transmission probability and longer distance can be achieved by employing a class of initial encodings and final decodings .
