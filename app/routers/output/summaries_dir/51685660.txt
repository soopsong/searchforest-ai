we propose a quantum generalisation of a classical neural network . the classical neurons are firstly rendered reversible by adding ancillary bits . then they are generalised to being quantum reversible , i.e.\ unitary . ( the classical networks we generalise are called feedforward , and have step - function activation functions . ) the quantum network can be trained efficiently using gradient descent on a cost function to perform quantum generalisations of classical tasks . we demonstrate numerically that it can : ( i ) compress quantum states onto a minimal number of qubits , creating a quantum autoencoder , and ( ii ) discover quantum communication protocols such as teleportation . our general recipe is theoretical and implementation - independent . the quantum neuron module can naturally be implemented photonically .
