the recently developed technique combining the weak coupling limit with the floquet formalism is applied to a model of two - level atom driven by a strong laser field and weakly coupled to heat baths . firstly , the case of a single electromagnetic bath at zero temperature is discussed and the formula for resonance fluorescence is derived . the expression describes the well - known mollow triplet , but its details differ from the standard ones based on additional simplifying assumptions . the second example describes the case of two thermal reservoirs : an electromagnetic one at finite temperature and the second dephasing one , which can be realized as a phononic or buffer gas reservoir . it is shown using the developed thermodynamical approach that the latter system can work in two regimes depending on the detuning sign : a heat pump transporting heat from the dephasing reservoir to an electromagnetic bath or can heat both , always at the expense of work supplied by the laser field .
