we discuss the generation of entangled states of two two - level atoms inside an optical resonator . when the cavity decay is continuously monitored , the absence of photon - counts is associated with the presence of an atomic entangled state . in addition to being conceptually simple , this scheme could be demonstrated with presently available technology . we describe how such a state is generated through conditional dynamics , using quantum jump methods , including both cavity damping and spontaneous emission decay , and evaluate the fidelity and relative entropy of entanglement of the generated state compared with the target entangled state .
