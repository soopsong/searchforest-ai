we geometrically characterize one - qubit dissipators of a lindblad type . an efficient parametrization in terms of 6 linear parameters opens the way to various optimizations with local dissipation . as an example , we study maximal steady - state singlet fraction that can be achieved with an arbitrary local dissipation and two qubit hamiltonian . we show that this singlet fraction has a discontinuity as one moves from unital to non - unital dissipators and demonstrate that the largest possible singlet fraction is approximately 0.654 . this means that for systems with a sufficiently entangled ground state there is a fundamental quantum limit to the lowest attainable energy . with local dissipation one is unable to cool the system below some limiting non - zero temperature .
