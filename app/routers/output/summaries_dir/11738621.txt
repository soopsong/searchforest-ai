for years , the quantum / reversible circuit community has been convinced that : a ) the addition of auxiliary qubits is instrumental in constructing a smaller quantum circuit ; and , b ) the introduction of quantum gates inside reversible circuits may result in more efficient designs . this paper presents a systematic approach to optimizing reversible ( and quantum ) circuits via the introduction of auxiliary qubits and quantum gates inside circuit designs . this advances our understanding of what may be achieved with a ) and b ) .
