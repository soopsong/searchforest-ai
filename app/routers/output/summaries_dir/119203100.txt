quantum algorithms for searching one or more marked items on a d - dimensional lattice provide an extension of grover 's search algorithm including a spatial component . we demonstrate that these lattice search algorithms can be viewed in terms of the level dynamics near an avoided crossing of a one - parameter family of quantum random walks . we give approximations for both the level - splitting at the avoided crossing and the effectively two - dimensional subspace of the full hilbert space spanning the level crossing . this makes it possible to give the leading order behaviour for the search time and the localisation probability in the limit of large lattice size including the leading order coefficients . for d=2 and d=3 , these coefficients are calculated explicitly . closed form expressions are given for higher dimensions .
