encoding qubits in multiple degrees of freedom ( dofs ) of a quantum system allows less - decoherence quantum information processing with much less quantum resources . we present a compact and scalable quantum circuit to determinately implement a hyper - parallel controlled - controlled - phase - flip ( hyper-$\rm{c^2pf}$ ) gate on a three - photon system in both the polarization and spatial dofs . in contrast with the one with many qubits encoding in one dof only , our hyper-$\rm{c^2pf}$ gate operating two independent $ \rm{c^2pf}$ gates on a three - photon system with less decoherence , and reduces the quantum resources required in quantum information processing by a half . additional photons , necessary for many approaches , are not required in the present scheme . our calculation shows that this hyper-$\rm{c^2pf}$ gate is feasible in experiment .
