we propose a novel hybrid platform where solid - state spin qubits are coupled to the acoustic modes of a two - dimensional array of optomechanical nano cavities . previous studies of coupled optomechanical cavities have shown that in the presence of strong optical driving fields , the interplay between the photon - phonon interaction and their respective inter - cavity hopping allows the generation of topological phases of sound and light . in particular , the mechanical modes can enter a chern insulator phase where the time - reversal symmetry is broken . in this context , we exploit the robust acoustic edge states as a chiral phononic waveguide and describe a state transfer protocol between spin qubits located in distant cavities . we analyze the performance of this protocol as a function of the relevant system parameters and show that a high - fidelity and purely unidirectional quantum state transfer can be implemented under experimentally realistic conditions . as a specific example , we discuss the implementation of such topological quantum networks in diamond based optomechanical crystals where point defects such as silicon - vacancy centers couple to the chiral acoustic channel via strain .
