it has recently been shown that optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) ising machines , consisting of coupled optical pulses circulating in a cavity with parametric gain , can be used to probabilistically find low - energy states of ising spin systems . in this work , we study optical ising machines that operate under simplified gaussian dynamics . we show that these dynamics are sufficient for reaching probabilities of success comparable to previous work . based on this result , we propose modified optical ising machines with simpler designs that do not use parametric gain yet achieve similar performance , thus suggesting a route to building much larger systems .
