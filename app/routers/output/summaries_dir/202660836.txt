the identification of light sources represents a task of utmost importance for the development of multiple photonic technologies . over the last decades , the identification of light sources as diverse as sunlight , laser radiation and molecule fluorescence has relied on the collection of photon statistics . in general , this task requires an extensive number of measurements to unveil the characteristic statistical fluctuations and correlation properties of light , particularly in the low - photon flux regime . in this letter , we exploit the self - learning features of artificial neural networks and naive bayes classifier to dramatically reduce the number of measurements required to discriminate thermal light from coherent light at the single - photon level . we demonstrate robust light identification with tens of measurements at mean photon numbers below one . our protocols demonstrate an improvement in terms of the number of measurements of several orders of magnitude with respect to conventional schemes for characterization of light sources . our work has important implications for multiple photonic technologies such as lidar and microscopy .
