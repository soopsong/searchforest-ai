reservoir engineering enables the robust preparation of pure quantum states in noisy environments . we show how a new family of quantum states of a mechanical oscillator can be stabilized in a cavity that is parametrically coupled to both the mechanical displacement and the displacement squared . the cavity is driven with three tones , on the red sideband , on the cavity resonance and on the second blue sideband . the states so stabilized are ( squeezed and displaced ) superpositions of a finite number of phonons . they show the unique feature of encompassing two prototypes of nonclassicality for bosonic systems : by adjusting the strength of the drives , one can in fact move from a single - phonon- to a schrodinger - cat - like state . the scheme is deterministic , supersedes the need for measurement - and - feedback loops and does not require initialization of the oscillator to the ground state . as such , it enables the unconditional preparation of nonclassical states of a macroscopic object .
