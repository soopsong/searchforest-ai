we propose a scheme for performing an entanglement - swapping operation within a quantum communications hub ( a bell like measurement ) using an nv centre 's $ |\pm 1\rangle \leftrightarrow | a_2 \rangle$ optical transition . this is based on the heralded absorption of a photon resonant with that transition . the quantum efficiency of a single photon absorption is low but can be improved by placing the nv center inside a micro cavity to boost the interaction time and further by recycling the leaked photon back into the cavity after flipping its phase and/or polarisation . throughout this process , the nv is repeatedly monitored via a qnd measurement that heralds whether or not the photon absorption has succeeded . upon success we know a destructive bell measurement has occurred between that photon and nv center . given low losses and a high per - pass absorption probability , this scheme allows the total success probability to approach unity . with long electron spin coherence times possible at low temperatures , this component could be useful within a memory - based quantum repeater or relay .
