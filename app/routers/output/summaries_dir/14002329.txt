quantum hamiltonian identification is important for characterizing the dynamics of quantum systems , calibrating quantum devices and achieving precise quantum control . in this paper , an effective two - step optimization ( tso ) quantum hamiltonian identification algorithm is developed within the framework of quantum process tomography . in the identification method , different probe states are inputted into quantum systems and the output states are estimated using the quantum state tomography protocol via linear regression estimation . the time - independent system hamiltonian is reconstructed based on the experimental data for the output states . the hamiltonian identification method has computational complexity o(d^6 ) where d is the dimension of the system hamiltonian . an error upper bound o(d^3 / n^(1/2))$ is also established , where n is the resource number for the tomography of each output state , and several numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tso hamiltonian identification method .
