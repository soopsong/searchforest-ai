we present an elementary derivation and generalisation of a recently reported method of simulating feedback in open quantum systems . we use our generalised method to simulate systems with multiple delays , as well as cascaded systems with delayed backscatter . in addition , we derive a generalisation of the quantum regression formula that applies to systems with delayed feedback , and show how to use the formula to compute two - time correlation functions of the system as well as output field properties . finally , we show that delayed coherent feedback can be simulated as a quantum teleportation protocol that requires only markovian resources , pre - shared entanglement , and time travel . the requirement for time travel can be avoided by using a probabilistic protocol .
