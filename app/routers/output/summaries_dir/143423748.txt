we explore excitation transport within a one - dimensional chain of atoms where the atomic transition dipoles are coupled to the free radiation field . when the atoms are separated by distances smaller or comparable to the wavelength of the transition , the exchange of virtual photons leads to the transport of the excitation through the lattice . even though this is a strongly dissipative system , we find that the transport is subradiant , that is , the excitation lifetime is orders of magnitude longer than the one of an individual atom . in particular , we show that a subspace of the spectrum is formed by subradiant states with a linear dispersion relation , which allows for the dispersionless transport of wave packets over long distances with virtually zero decay rate . moreover , the group velocity and direction of the transport can be controlled via an external uniform magnetic field while preserving its subradiant character . the simplicity and versatility of this system , together with the robustness of subradiance against disorder , makes it relevant for a range of applications such as lossless energy transport and long - time light storage .
