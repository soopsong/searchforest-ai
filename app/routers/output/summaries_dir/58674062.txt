we provide model reduction formulas for open quantum systems consisting of a target component which weakly interacts with a strongly dissipative environment . the time - scale separation between the uncoupled dynamics and the interaction allows to employ tools from center manifold theory and geometric singular perturbation theory to eliminate the variables associated to the environment ( adiabatic elimination ) with high - order accuracy . an important specificity is to preserve the quantum structure : reduced dynamics in ( positive ) lindblad form and coordinate mappings in kraus form . we provide formulas of the reduced dynamics . the main contributions of this paper are ( i ) to show how the decomposition of the environment into $ k$ components enables its efficient treatment , avoiding the quantum curse of dimension ; and ( ii ) to extend the results to the case where the target component is subject to hamiltonian evolution at the fast time - scale . we apply our theory to a microwave superconducting quantum resonator subject to material losses , and we show that our reduced - order model can explain the transmission spectrum observed in a recent pump probe experiment .
