in this work we consider a current carrying two level quantum dot(qd ) that is coupled to a single mode phonon bath . using self - consistent hartree - fock approximation , we obtain the i - v curve of qd . by considering the linear response of our system to an incoming classical light , we see that depending on the parametric regime , the system could have weak or strong light absorption or may even show lasing . this lasing occurs at high enough bias voltages and is explained by a population inversion considering side bands , while the total electron population in the higher level is less than the lower one . the frequency at which we have the most significant lasing depends on the level spacing and phonon frequency and not on the electron - phonon coupling strength .
