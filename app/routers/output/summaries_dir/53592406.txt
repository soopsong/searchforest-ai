we study the optical transmission characteristics of pump - probe driven spinning optomechanical ring resonators coupled in a series configuration . after performing the steady - state analysis valid for an arbitrary number of resonators , as an example , we discuss the two - resonator problem in detail . therein , we focus on how changing the optical sagnac effect due to same or opposite spinning directions of resonators can lead to enhanced , non - reciprocal and delayed probe light transmission . this work can help in devising spin degree of freedom based novel devices of manipulating light propagation in quantum networks and quantum communication technologies .
