true tripartite entanglement of the state of a system of three qubits can be classified on the basis of stochastic local operations and classical communications ( slocc ) . such states can be classified in two categories : ghz states and w - states . it is known that ghz states can be used for teleportation and superdense coding , but the prototype w - state can not be . however , we show that there is a class of w - states that can be used for perfect teleportation and superdense coding .
