no - cloning theorem , a profound fundamental principle of quantum mechanics , also provides a crucial practical basis for secure quantum communication . the security of communication can be ultimately guaranteed if the output fidelity via communication channel is above the no - cloning bound ( ncb ) . in quantum communications using continuous - variable ( cv ) systems , gaussian states , more specifically , coherent states have been widely studied as inputs , but less is known for non - gaussian states . we aim at exploring quantum communication covering cv states comprehensively with distinct sets of unknown states properly defined . our main results here are ( i ) to establish the ncb for a broad class of quantum non - gaussian states including fock states , their superpositions and schrodinger - cat states and ( ii ) to examine the relation between ncb and quantum non - gaussianity ( qng ) . we find that ncb typically decreases with qng . remarkably , this does not mean that quantum non - gaussian states are less demanding for secure communication . by extending our study to mixed - state inputs , we demonstrate that qng specifically in terms of wigner negativity requires more resources to achieve output fidelity above ncb in cv teleportation . the more non - gaussian , the harder to achieve secure communication , which can have crucial implications for cv quantum communications .
