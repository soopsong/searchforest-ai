in this paper , we introduce a multidimensional generalization of kitagawa 's split - step discrete - time quantum walk , study the spectrum of its evolution operator for the case of one defect coins , and prove localization of the walk . using a spectral mapping theorem , we can reduce the spectral analysis of the evolution operator to that of a discrete schr\"{o}dinger operator with variable coefficients , which is analyzed using the feshbach map .
