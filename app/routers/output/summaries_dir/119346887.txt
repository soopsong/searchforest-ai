the interaction of a light field with a quantum - mechanical system can be studied in an optically controlled semiconductor quantum dot . when driven by a continuous light field switched on instantaneously , the quantum dot occupation performs rabi oscillations . unlike an atomic system , the quantum dot is coupled to phonons , which leads to a damping of the rabi oscillations . here we model the time - resolved probe spectra to monitor these dynamics and study the influence of phonons on the spectra . the spectra consist of up to three peaks , similar to the mollow - triplet known from quantum optics . we develop analytical equations within a rate equation model and show that they agree excellently with a numerical solution using a well established correlation expansion approach .
