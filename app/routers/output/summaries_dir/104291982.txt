embedded in an ohmic environment , the josephson current peak can transfer part of its weight to finite voltage and the junction becomes resistive . the dissipative environment can even suppress the superconducting effect of the junction via a quantum phase transition occuring when the ohmic resistance $ r_s$ exceeds the quantum resistance $ r_{q}=h/(2e)^2$. for a topological junction hosting majorana bound states with a $ 4 \pi$ periodicity of the superconducting phase , the phase transition is shifted to $ 4 r_{q}$. we consider a josephson junction mixing the $ 2 \pi$ and $ 4 \pi$ periodicities shunted by a resistor , with a resistance between $ r_q$ and $ 4 r_q$. starting with a quantum circuit model , we derive the non - monotonic temperature dependence of its differential resistance resulting from the competition between the two periodicities ; the $ 4 \pi$ periodicity dominating at the lowest temperatures . the non - monotonic behaviour is first revealed by straightforward perturbation theory and then substantiated by a fermionization to exactly solvable models when $ r_s=2r_{q}$ : the model is mapped onto a helical wire coupled to a topological superconductor when the josephson energy is small and to the emery - kivelson line of the two - channel kondo model in the opposite case .
