alignment is a geometric relation between pairs of weyl - heisenberg sics , one in dimension $ d$ and another in dimension $ d(d-2)$ , manifesting a well - founded conjecture about a number - theoretical connection between the sics . in this paper , we prove that if $ d$ is even , the sic in dimension $ d(d-2)$ of an aligned pair can be partitioned into $ ( d-2)^2 $ tight $ d^2$-frames of rank $ d(d-1)/2 $ and , alternatively , into $ d^2 $ tight $ ( d-2)^2$-frames of rank $ ( d-1)(d-2)/2$. the corresponding result for odd $ d$ is already known , but the proof for odd $ d$ relies on results which are not available for even $ d$. we develop methods that allow us to overcome this issue . in addition , we provide a relatively detailed study of parity operators in the clifford group , emphasizing differences in the theory of parity operators in even and odd dimensions and discussing consequences due to such differences . in a final section , we study implications of alignment for the symmetry of the sic .
