we report on the realization of a stable solid state room temperature source for single photons . it is based on the fluorescence of a single nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) color center in a diamond nanocrystal . antibunching has been observed in the fluorescence light under both continuous and pulsed excitation . our source delivers 2 * 10 ^ 4 single - photon pulses per second at an excitation repetition rate of 10 mhz . the number of two - photon pulses is reduced by a factor of five compared to strongly attenuated coherent sources .
