in this paper , we would like to systematically explore the implications of non - perturbative effects on entanglement in a many body system . instead of pursuing the usual path - integral method in a singular space , we attempt to study the wavefunctions in detail . we begin with a toy model of multiple particles whose interaction potential admits multiple minima . we study the entanglement of the true ground state after taking the tunnelling effects into account and find some simple patterns . notably , in the case of multiple particle interactions , entanglement entropy generically decreases with increasing number of minima . the knowledge of the subsystem actually increases with the number of minima . the reduced density matrix can also be seen to have close connections with graph spectra . in a more careful study of the two - well tunnelling system , we also extract the exponentially suppressed tail contribution , the analogues of instantons . to understand the effects of multiple minima in a field theory , it inspires us to inspect wavefunctions in a toy model of bosonic field describing quasi - particles of two different condensates related by bogoliubov transformations . we find that the area law is naturally preserved . this is probably a useful set of perspectives that promise wider applications .
