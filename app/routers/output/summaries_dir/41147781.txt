local and inter - area oscillations in bulk power systems are typically identified using spatial profiles of poorly damped modes , and they are mitigated via carefully tuned decentralized controllers . in this paper , we employ non - modal tools to analyze and control inter - area oscillations . our input - output analysis examines power spectral density and variance amplification of stochastically forced systems and offers new insights relative to modal approaches . to improve upon the limitations of conventional wide - area control strategies , we also study the problem of signal selection and optimal design of sparse and block - sparse wide - area controllers . in our design , we preserve rotational symmetry of the power system by allowing only relative angle measurements in the distributed controllers . for the ieee 39 new england model , we examine performance tradeoffs and robustness of different control architectures and show that optimal retuning of fully - decentralized control strategies can effectively guard against local and inter - area oscillations .
