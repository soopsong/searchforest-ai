in an effort to overcome the limitations of random spin - glass benchmarks for quantum annealers , focus has shifted to carefully - crafted gadget - based problems whose logical structure has typically a planar topology . recent experiments on these gadget problems using a commercially - available quantum annealer have demonstrated an impressive performance over a selection of commonly - used classical optimization heuristics . here we show that efficient classical optimization techniques , such as minimum - weight perfect matching , can solve these gadget problems exactly and in polynomial time . we present approaches on how to mitigate this shortcoming of commonly - used benchmark problems based on planar logical topologies .
