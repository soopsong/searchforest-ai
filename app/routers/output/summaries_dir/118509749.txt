we present a complete polarization characterization of any quantum state of two orthogonal polarization modes , and give a systematic measurement procedure to collect the necessary data . full characterization requires measurements of the photon number in both modes and linear optics . in the situation where only the photon - number difference can be determined , a limited but useful characterization is obtained . the characteristic stokes moment profiles are given for several common quantum states .
