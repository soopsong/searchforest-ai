at the core of every frustrated system , one can identify the existence of frustrated rings that are usually interpreted in terms of single -- particle physics . we check this point of view through a careful analysis of the entanglement entropy of both models that admit an exact single -- particle decomposition of their hilbert space due to integrability and those for which the latter is supposed to hold only as a low energy approximation . in particular , we study generic spin chains made by an odd number of sites with short - range antiferromagnetic interactions and periodic boundary conditions , thus characterized by a weak , i.e. nonextensive , frustration . while for distances of the order of the correlation length the phenomenology of these chains is similar to that of the non - frustrated cases , we find that correlation functions involving a number of sites scaling like the system size follow different rules . we quantify the long - range correlations through the von neumann entanglement entropy , finding that indeed it violates the area law , while not diverging with the system size . this behavior is well fitted by a universal law that we derive from the conjectured single -- particle picture .
