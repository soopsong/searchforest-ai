in this paper we discuss an efficient technique that can implement any given boolean function as a quantum circuit . the method converts a truth table of a boolean function to the corresponding quantum circuit using a minimal number of auxiliary qubits . we give examples of some circuits synthesized with this technique . a direct result that follows from the technique is a new way to convert any classical digital circuit to its classical reversible form .
