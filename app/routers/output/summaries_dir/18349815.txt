the safety of a quantum key distribution system relies on the fact that any eavesdropping attempt on the quantum channel creates errors in the transmission . for a given error rate , the amount of information that may have leaked to the eavesdropper depends on both the particular system and the eavesdropping strategy . in this work , we discuss quantum cryptographic protocols based on the transmission of weak coherent states and present a new system , based on a symbiosis of two existing ones , and for which the information available to the eavesdropper is significantly reduced . this system is therefore safer than the two previous ones . we also suggest a possible experimental implementation .
