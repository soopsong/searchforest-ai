we introduce a multi - mode squeezing coefficient to characterize entanglement in $ n$-partite continuous - variable systems . the coefficient relates to the squeezing of collective observables in the $ 2n$-dimensional phase space and can be readily extracted from the covariance matrix . simple extensions further permit to reveal entanglement within specific partitions of a multipartite system . applications with nonlinear observables allow for the detection of non - gaussian entanglement .
