we propose two schemes for concentration of $ ( n+1)$-qubit entangled states that can be written in the form of $ ( \alpha|\varphi_{0}\rangle|0\rangle+\beta|\varphi_{1}\rangle|1\rangle)_{n+1}$ where $ |\varphi_{0}\rangle$ and $ |\varphi_{1}\rangle$ are mutually orthogonal $ n$-qubit states . the importance of this general form is that the entangled states like bell , cat , ghz , ghz - like , $ |\omega\rangle$ , $ |q_{5}\rangle$ , 4-qubit cluster states and specific states from the 9 slocc - nonequivalent families of 4-qubit entangled states can be expressed in this form . the proposed entanglement concentration protocol is based on the local operations and classical communications ( locc ) . it is shown that the maximum success probability for ecp using quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) technique is $ 2\beta^{2}$ for $ ( n+1)$-qubit states of the prescribed form . it is shown that the proposed schemes can be implemented optically . further it is also noted that the proposed schemes can be implemented using quantum dot and microcavity systems .
