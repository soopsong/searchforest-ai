the need for secrecy and security is essential in communication . secret sharing is a conventional protocol to distribute a secret message to a group of parties , who can not access it individually but need to cooperate in order to decode it . while several variants of this protocol have been investigated , including realizations using quantum systems , the security of quantum secret sharing schemes still remains unproven almost two decades after their original conception . here we establish an unconditional security proof for continuous variable entanglement - based quantum secret sharing schemes , in the limit of asymptotic keys and for an arbitrary number of players . we tackle the problem by resorting to the recently developed one - sided device - independent approach to quantum key distribution . we demonstrate theoretically the feasibility of our scheme , which can be implemented by gaussian states and homodyne measurements , with no need for ideal single - photon sources or quantum memories . our results contribute to validating quantum secret sharing as a viable primitive for quantum technologies .
