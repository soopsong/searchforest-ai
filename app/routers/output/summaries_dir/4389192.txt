self - organizing logic is a recently - suggested framework that allows the solution of boolean truth tables"in reverse,"i.e . , it is able to satisfy the logical proposition of gates regardless to which terminal(s ) the truth value is assigned ( " terminal - agnostic logic " ) . it can be realized if time non - locality ( memory ) is present . a practical realization of self - organizing logic gates ( solgs ) can be done by combining circuit elements with and without memory . by employing one such realization , we show , numerically , that solgs exploit elementary instantons to reach equilibrium points . instantons are classical trajectories of the non - linear equations of motion describing solgs , and connect topologically distinct critical points in the phase space . by linear analysis at those points , we show that these instantons connect the initial critical point of the dynamics , with at least one unstable direction , directly to the final fixed point . we also show that the memory content of these gates only affects the relaxation time to reach the logically consistent solution . finally , we demonstrate , by solving the corresponding stochastic differential equations , that since instantons connect critical points , noise and perturbations may change the instanton trajectory in the phase space , but not the initial and final critical points . therefore , even for extremely large noise levels , the gates self - organize to the correct solution . our work provides a physical understanding of , and can serve as an inspiration for , new models of bi - directional logic gates that are emerging as important tools in physics - inspired , unconventional computing .
