the theory of quantum feedback networks has recently been developed with the aim of showing how quantum input - output components may be connected together so as to control , stabilize or enhance the performance of one of the subcomponents . in this paper we show how the degree to which an idealized component ( a degenerate parametric amplifier in the strong - coupling regime ) can squeeze input fields may be enhanced by placing the component in - loop in a simple feedback mechanism involving a beam splitter . we study the spectral properties of output fields , placing particular emphasis on the elastic and inelastic components of the power density .
