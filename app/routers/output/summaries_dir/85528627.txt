we propose a method to generate nonclassical states of light in multimode microwave cavities . our approach considers two - photon processes that take place in a system composed of two extended cavities and an ultrastrongly coupled light - matter system . under specific resonance conditions , our method generates , in a deterministic manner , product states of uncorrelated photon pairs , bell states , and w states . we demonstrate improved generation times when increasing the number of multimode cavities , and prove the generation of genuine multipartite entangled states when coupling an ancillary system to each cavity . finally , we discuss the feasibility of our proposal in circuit quantum electrodynamics .
