this is a sequel to the papers ( quant - ph/9910063 ) and ( quant - ph/0004102 ) . the aim of this paper is to give mathematical foundations to holonomic quantum computation ( computer ) proposed by zanardi and rasetti ( quant - ph/9904011 ) and pachos and chountasis ( quant - ph/9912093 ) . in 2-qubit case we give an explicit form to non - abelian berry connection of quantum computational bundle which is associated with holonomic quantum computation , on some parameter space . we also suggest a possibility that not only usual holonomy but also higher - dimensional holonomies must be used to prove a universality of our holonomic quantum computation .
