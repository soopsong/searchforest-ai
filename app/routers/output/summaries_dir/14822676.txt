we consider a network topology design problem in which an initial undirected graph underlying the network is given and the objective is to select a set of edges to add to the graph to optimize the coherence of the resulting network . we show that network coherence is a submodular function of the network topology . as a consequence , a simple greedy algorithm is guaranteed to produce near optimal edge set selections . we also show that fast rank one updates of the laplacian pseudoinverse using generalizations of the sherman - morrison formula and an accelerated variant of the greedy algorithm can speed up the algorithm by several orders of magnitude in practice . these allow our algorithms to scale to network sizes far beyond those that can be handled by convex relaxation heuristics .
