we theoretically investigate the spectral property of a biphoton state from multiplexed thermal atomic ensembles . this biphoton state originates from the cascade emissions , which can be generated by two weak pump fields under four - wave mixing condition . under this condition , a signal photon from the upper transition , chosen in a telecommunication bandwidth , can be generated along with a correlated idler photon from the lower infrared transition . we can spectrally shape the biphoton state by multiplexing the atomic ensembles with frequency - shifted emissions , where the entropy of entanglement can be analyzed via schmidt decompositions . we find that this spectral entanglement increases when more vapor cells are multiplexed with correlated or anti - correlated signal and idler fields . the eigenvalues in schmidt bases approach degenerate under this multiplexing scheme , and corresponding schmidt numbers can be larger than the number of the multiplexed vapor cells , showing the enlarged entropy of entanglement and excess correlated modes in continuous frequency spaces . we also investigate the lowest entropy of entanglement allowed in the multiplexing scheme , which is preferential for generating a pure single photon source . this shows the potentiality to spectrally shape the biphoton source , where high - capacity spectral modes can be applied in long - distance quantum communication and multimode quantum information processing .
