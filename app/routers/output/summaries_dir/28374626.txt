continuous - time open quantum walks ( ctoqw ) are introduced as the formulation of quantum dynamical semigroups of trace - preserving and completely positive linear maps ( or quantum markov semigroups ) on graphs . we show that a ctoqw always converges to a steady state regardless of the initial state when a graph is connected . when the graph is both connected and regular , it is shown that the steady state is the maximally mixed state . as shown by the examples in this article , the steady states of ctoqw can be very unusual and complicated even though the underlying graphs are simple . the examples demonstrate that the structure of a graph can affect quantum coherence in ctoqw through a long time run . precisely , the quantum coherence persists throughout the evolution of the ctoqw when the underlying topology is certain irregular graphs ( such as a path or a star as shown in the examples ) . in contrast , the quantum coherence will eventually vanish from the open quantum system when the underlying topology is a regular graph ( such as a cycle ) .
