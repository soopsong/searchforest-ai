we investigate a one - dimensional atomic lattice laser - driven to a rydberg state , in which engineered dissipation channels lead to entanglement in the many - body system . in particular , we demonstrate the efficient generation of ground states of a frustration - free hamiltonian , as well as $ w$ states . we discuss the realization of the required coherent and dissipative terms , and we perform extensive numerical simulations characterizing the fidelity of the state preparation procedure . we identify the optimum parameters for high fidelity entanglement preparation and investigate the scaling with the size of the system .
