we demonstrate a quantum regime of dissipative nonlinear oscillator where creation of fock states as well as superpositions of fock states are realized for time - intervals exceeding the characteristic decoherence time . preparation of quantum states is conditioned by strong kerr nonlinearity as well as by excitation of resolved lower oscillatory energy levels with specific train of gaussian pulses . this provides practical signatures to look for in experiments with cooled nonlinear oscillators .
