we consider a composite open quantum system consisting of a fast subsystem coupled to a slow one . using the time - scale separation , we develop an adiabatic elimination technique to derive at any order the reduced model describing the slow subsystem . the method , based on an asymptotic expansion and geometric singular perturbation theory , ensures the physical interpretation of the reduced second - order model by giving the reduced dynamics in a lindblad form and the state reduction in kraus map form . we give explicit second - order formulas for hamiltonian or cascade coupling between the two subsystems . these formulas can be used to engineer , via a careful choice of the fast subsystem , the hamiltonian and lindbald operators governing the dissipative dynamics of the slow subsystem .
