we consider the security of continuous - variable quantum key distribution using thermal ( or noisy ) gaussian resource states . specifically , we analyze this against collective gaussian attacks using direct and reverse reconciliation where both protocols use either homodyne or heterodyne detection . we show that in the case of direct reconciliation with heterodyne detection , an improved robustness to channel noise is achieved when large amounts of preparation noise is added , as compared to the case when no preparation noise is added . we also consider the theoretical limit of infinite preparation noise and show a secure key can still be achieved in this limit provided the channel noise is less than the preparation noise . finally , we consider the security of quantum key distribution at various electromagnetic wavelengths and derive an upper bound related to an entanglement - breaking eavesdropping attack and discuss the feasibility of microwave quantum key distribution .
