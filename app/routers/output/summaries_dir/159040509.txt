we demonstrate a technique for optimizing quantum circuits that is analogous to classical windowing . specifically , we show that small table lookups can allow control qubits to be iterated in groups instead of individually . we present various windowed quantum arithmetic circuits , including a windowed modular exponentiation with nested windowed modular multiplications , which have lower toffoli counts than previous work at register sizes ranging from tens of qubits to thousands of qubits .
