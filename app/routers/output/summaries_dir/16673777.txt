the lists of bits processed in quantum key distribution are necessarily of finite length . the need for finite - key unconditional security bounds has been recognized long ago , but the theoretical tools have become available only very recently . we provide finite - key unconditional security bounds for two practical implementations of the bennett - brassard 1984 coding : prepare - and - measure implementations without decoy states , and entanglement - based implementations . a finite - key bound for prepare - and - measure implementations with decoy states is also derived under a simplified treatment of the statistical fluctuations . the presentation is tailored to allow direct application of the bounds in experiments . finally , the bounds are also evaluated on a priori reasonable expected values of the observed parameters .
