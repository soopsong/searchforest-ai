the practical prospect of quantum communication and information processing relies on sophisticated single photon pairs which feature controllable waveform , narrow spectrum , excellent purity , fiber compatibility and miniaturized design . for practical realizations , stable , miniaturized , low - cost devices are required . sources with one or some of above performances have been demonstrated already , but it is quite challenging to have a source with all of the described characteristics simultaneously . here we report on an integrated single - longitudinal - mode non - degenerate narrowband photon pair source , which exhibits all requirements needed for quantum applications . the device is composed of a periodically poled ti - indiffused lithium niobate waveguide with high reflective dielectric mirror coatings deposited on the waveguide end - faces . photon pairs with wavelengths around 890 nm and 1320 nm are generated via type ii phase - matched parametric down - conversion . clustering in this dispersive cavity restricts the whole conversion spectrum to one single - longitudinal - mode in a single cluster yielding a narrow bandwidth of only 60 mhz . the high conversion efficiency in the waveguide , together with the spectral clustering in the doubly resonant waveguide , leads to a high brightness of $ 3\times10 ^ 4~$pairs/(s$\cdot$mw$\cdot$mhz ) . this source exhibits prominent single - longitudinal - mode purity and remarkable temporal shaping capability . especially , due to temporal broadening , we can observe that the coherence time of the two - photon component of pdc state is actually longer than the one of the single photon states . the miniaturized monolithic design makes this source have various fiber communication applications .
