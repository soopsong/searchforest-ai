we study the effect of anisotropy on holographic entanglement entropy ( hee ) and holographic mutual information ( mi ) in the q - lattice model , by exploring the hee and mi for infinite strips along arbitrary directions . we find that the lattice always enhances the hee . the mi , however , is enhanced by lattice for large sub - regions ; while for small sub - regions , the mi is suppressed by the lattice . we also discuss how these phenomena result from the deformation of geometry caused by q - lattices .
