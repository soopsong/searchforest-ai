a number of many - body problems can be formulated using hamiltonians that are quadratic in the creation and annihilation operators . here , we show how such quadratic hamiltonians can be efficiently estimated indirectly , employing very few resources . we find that almost all properties of the hamiltonian are determined by its surface , and that these properties can be measured even if the system can only be initialised to a mixed state . therefore our method can be applied to various physical models , with important examples including coupled nano - mechanical oscillators , hopping fermions in optical lattices , and transverse ising chains .
