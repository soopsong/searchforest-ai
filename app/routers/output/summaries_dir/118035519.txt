a method is proposed to design the time dependence of the trap frequency and achieve in a short time an adiabatic - like ( frictionless ) evolution of bose - einstein condensates governed by the gross - pitaevskii equation . different cases depending on the effective dimension of the trap and the interaction regimes are considered . 2d traps are particularly suitable as the method can be applied without the need to impose any additional time - dependent change in the strength of the interatomic interaction or a thomas - fermi regime as it occurs for 1d and 3d traps .
