the firewall paradox for black holes is often viewed as indicating a conflict between unitarity and the equivalence principle . we elucidate how the paradox manifests as a limitation of semiclassical theory , rather than presents a conflict between fundamental principles . two principal features of the fundamental and semiclassical theories address two versions of the paradox : the entanglement and typicality arguments . first , the physical hilbert space describing excitations on a fixed black hole background in the semiclassical theory is exponentially smaller than the number of physical states in the fundamental theory of quantum gravity . second , in addition to the hilbert space for physical excitations , the semiclassical theory possesses an unphysically large fock space built by creation and annihilation operators on the fixed black hole background . understanding these features not only eliminates the necessity of firewalls but also leads to a new picture of hawking emission contrasting pair creation at the horizon .
