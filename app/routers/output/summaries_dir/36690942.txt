we show how it is possible to suppress decoherence using tailored external forcing acting as pulses . in the limit of infinitely frequent pulses decoherence and dissipation are completely frozen ; however , a significant decoherence suppression is already obtained when the frequency of the pulses is of the order of the reservoir typical frequency scale . this method could be useful in particular to suppress the decoherence of the center - of - mass motion in ion traps .
