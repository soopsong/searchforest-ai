a new algorithm for minimization of quantum cost of quantum circuits has been designed . the quantum cost of different quantum circuits of particular interest ( eg . circuits for epr , quantum teleportation , shor code and different quantum arithmetic operations ) are computed by using the proposed algorithm . the quantum costs obtained using the proposed algorithm is compared with the existing results and it is found that the algorithm has produced minimum quantum cost in all cases .
