we study a single - mode cavity weakly coupled to a voltage - biased quantum point contact . in a perturbative analysis , the lowest order predicts a thermal state for the cavity photons , driven by the emission noise of the conductor . the cavity is thus emptied as all transmission probabilities of the quantum point contact approach one or zero . two - photon processes are identified at higher coupling , and pair absorption dominates over pair emission for all bias voltages . as a result , the number of cavity photons , the cavity damping rate and the second order coherence $ g^{(2)}$ are all reduced and exhibit less bunching than the thermal state . these results are obtained with a keldysh path integral formulation and reproduced with rate equations . they can be seen as a backaction of the cavity measuring the electronic noise . extending the standard $ p(e)$ theory to a steady - state situation , we compute the modified noise properties of the conductor and find quantitative agreement with the perturbative calculation .
