one - way quantum computing is experimentally appealing because it requires only local measurements on an entangled resource called a cluster state . record - size , but non - universal , continuous - variable cluster states were recently demonstrated separately in the time and frequency domains . we propose to combine these approaches into a scalable architecture in which a single optical parametric oscillator and simple interferometer entangle up to ( $ 3\times 10 ^ 3 $ frequencies ) $ \times$ ( unlimited number of temporal modes ) into a new and computationally universal continuous - variable cluster state . we introduce a generalized measurement protocol to enable improved computational performance on this new entanglement resource .
