single ions held in linear paul traps are promising candidates for a future quantum computer . here , we discuss a two - layer microstructured segmented linear ion trap . the radial and axial potentials are obtained from numeric field simulations and the geometry of the trap is optimized . as the trap electrodes are segmented in the axial direction , the trap allows the transport of ions between different spatial regions . starting with realistic numerically obtained axial potentials , we optimize the transport of an ion such that the motional degrees of freedom are not excited , even though the transport speed far exceeds the adiabatic regime . in our optimization we achieve a transport within roughly two oscillation periods in the axial trap potential compared to typical adiabatic transports that take of the order 100 oscillations . furthermore heating due to quantum mechanical effects is estimated and suppression strategies are proposed .
