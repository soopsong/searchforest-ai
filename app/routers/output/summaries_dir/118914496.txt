we show that the state of the hawking radiation emitted from a large schwarzschild black hole ( bh ) deviates significantly from a classical state , in spite of its apparent thermal nature . for this state , the occupation numbers of single modes of massless asymptotic fields , such as photons , gravitons and possibly neutrinos , are small and , as a result , their relative fluctuations are large . the occupation numbers of massive fields are much smaller and suppressed beyond even the expected boltzmann suppression . it follows that this type of thermal state can not be viewed as classical or even semiclassical . we substantiate this claim by showing that , in a state with low occupation numbers , physical observables have large quantum fluctuations and , as such , can not be faithfully described by a mean - field or by a wkb - like semiclassical state . since the evolution of the bh is unitary , our results imply that the state of the bh interior must also be non - classical when described in terms of the asymptotic fields . we show that such a non - classical interior can not be described in terms of a semiclassical geometry , even though the average curvature is sub - planckian .
