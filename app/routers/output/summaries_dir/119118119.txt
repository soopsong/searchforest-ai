we investigate the collective excitation effect in a scheme where three identical rydberg atoms are arranged in an equilateral triangular lattice . by using a static electric field polarizing the atomic dipoles , the dipole - dipole interactions between two rydberg atoms are essentially anisotropic and can even disappear in the several special resonance cases . for that fact , we observe collectively enhanced excitation probability of single rydberg atom in resonant areas in the case of strong blockade , and that of double or triple rydberg atoms in the case of partial blockade . to give more evidences for this collective excitation enhancement , we study the two - body quantum correlation between three rydberg atoms , as well as the dependence of the blockade radius on the length of triangle sides , which present a good agreement with the excitation properties .
