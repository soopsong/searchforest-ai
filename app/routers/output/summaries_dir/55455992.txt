boson sampling is a specific quantum computation , which is likely hard to implement efficiently on a classical computer . the task is to sample the output photon number distribution of a linear optical interferometric network , which is fed with single - photon fock state inputs . a question that has been asked is if the sampling problems associated with any other input quantum states of light ( other than the fock states ) to a linear optical network and suitable output detection strategies are also of similar computational complexity as boson sampling . we consider the states that differ from the fock states by a displacement operation , namely the displaced fock states and the photon - added coherent states . it is easy to show that the sampling problem associated with displaced single - photon fock states and a displaced photon number detection scheme is in the same complexity class as boson sampling for all values of displacement . on the other hand , we show that the sampling problem associated with single - photon - added coherent states and the same displaced photon number detection scheme demonstrates a computational complexity transition . it transitions from being just as hard as boson sampling when the input coherent amplitudes are sufficiently small , to a classically simulatable problem in the limit of large coherent amplitudes .
