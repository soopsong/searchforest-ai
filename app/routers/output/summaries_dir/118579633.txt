measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution ( mdi - qkd ) , leaving the detection procedure to the third partner and thus being immune to all detector side - channel attacks , is very promising for the construction of high - security quantum information networks . we propose a scheme to implement mdi - qkd , but with continuous variables instead of discrete ones , i.e. , with the source of gaussian - modulated coherent states , based on the principle of continuous - variable entanglement swapping . this protocol not only can be implemented with current telecom components but also has high key rates compared to its discrete counterpart ; thus it will be highly compatible with quantum networks .
