we study the quantum speed limit for open quantum systems described by the lindblad master equation . the obtained inequality shows a trade - off relation between the operation time and the physical quantities such as the energy fluctuation and the entropy production . we further identify a quantity characterizing the speed of the state transformation , which appears only when we consider the open system dynamics in the quantum regime . when the thermal relaxation is dominant compared to the unitary dynamics of the system , we show that this quantity is approximated by the energy fluctuation of the counter - diabatic hamiltonian which is used as a control field in the shortcuts to adiabaticity protocol . we discuss the physical meaning of the obtained quantum speed limit and try to give better intuition about the speed in open quantum systems .
