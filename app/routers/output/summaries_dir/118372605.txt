being able to quantify the level of coherent control in a proposed device implementing a quantum information processor ( qip ) is an important task for both comparing different devices and assessing a device 's prospects with regards to achieving fault - tolerant quantum control . we implement in a liquid - state nuclear magnetic resonance qip the randomized benchmarking protocol presented by knill et al ( pra 77 : 012307 ( 2008 ) ) . we report an error per randomized $ \frac{\pi}{2}$ pulse of $ 1.3 \pm 0.1 \times 10^{-4}$ with a single qubit qip and show an experimentally relevant error model where the randomized benchmarking gives a signature fidelity decay which is not possible to interpret as a single error per gate . we explore and experimentally investigate multi - qubit extensions of this protocol and report an average error rate for one and two qubit gates of $ 4.7 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{-3}$ for a three qubit qip . we estimate that these error rates are still not decoherence limited and thus can be improved with modifications to the control hardware and software .
