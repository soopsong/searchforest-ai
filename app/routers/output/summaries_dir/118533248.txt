we demonstrate the possibility of a self - consistent characterization of the photon - number statistics of a light field by using photoemissive detectors with internal gain simply endowed with linear input / output responses . the method can be applied to both microscopic and mesoscopic photon - number regimes . the detectors must operate in the linear range without need of photon - counting capabilities .
