quantum image processing ( qip)is an exciting new field showing a lot of promise as a powerful addition to the arsenal of image processing techniques . representing image pixel by pixel using classical information requires an enormous amount of computational resources . hence , exploring methods to represent images in a different paradigm of information is important . in this work , we study the representation of images in quantum information . the main motivation for this pursuit is the ability of storing n bits of classical information in only log(2n ) quantum bits ( qubits ) . the promising first step was the exponentially efficient implementation of the fourier transform in quantum computers as compared to fast fourier transform in classical computers . in addition , images encoded in quantum information could obey unique quantum properties like superposition or entanglement .
