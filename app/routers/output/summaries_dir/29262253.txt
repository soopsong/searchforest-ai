a major challenge of today 's quantum communication systems lies in the transmission of quantum information with high rates over long distances in the presence of unavoidable losses . thereby the achievable quantum communication rate is fundamentally limited by the amount of energy that can be transmitted per use of the channel . it is hence vital to develop quantum communication protocols that encode quantum information as energy efficiently as possible . to this aim we investigate continuous - variable quantum teleportation as a method of distributing quantum information . we explore the possibility to encode information on multiple optical modes and derive upper and lower bounds on the achievable quantum channel capacities . this analysis enables us to benchmark single - mode versus multi - mode entanglement resources . our research reveals that multiplexing does not only feature an enhanced energy efficiency , leading to an exponential increase in the achievable quantum communication rates in comparison to single - mode coding , but also yields an improved loss resilience . however , as reliable quantum information transfer is only achieved for entanglement values above a certain threshold , a careful optimization of the number of coding modes is needed to obtain the optimal quantum channel capacity .
