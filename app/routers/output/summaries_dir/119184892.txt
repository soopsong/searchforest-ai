randomized benchmarking provides a tool for obtaining precise quantitative estimates of the average error rate of a physical quantum channel . here we define real randomized benchmarking , which enables a separate determination of the average error rate in the real and complex parts of the channel . this provides more fine - grained information about average error rates with approximately the same cost as the standard protocol . the protocol requires only averaging over the real clifford group , a subgroup of the full complex clifford group , and makes use of the fact that it forms an orthogonal 2-design . it therefore allows benchmarking of fault - tolerant gates for an encoding which does not contain the full clifford group transversally . furthermore , our results are especially useful when considering quantum computations on rebits ( or real encodings of complex computations ) , in which case the real clifford group now plays the role of the complex clifford group when studying stabilizer circuits .
