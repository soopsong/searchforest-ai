we study the interaction of a light beams carrying angular momentum with a single , trapped and well localized ion . we provide a detailed calculation of selection rules and excitation probabilities for quadrupole transitions . the results show the dependencies on the angular momentum and polarization of the laser beam as well as the direction of the quantization magnetic field . in order to observe optimally the specific effects , focusing the angular momentum beam close to the diffraction limit is required . we discuss a protocol for examining experimentally the effects on the s$_{1/2}$ to d$_{5/2}$ transition using a $ ^{40}$ca$^+$ ion . various applications and advantages are expected when using light carrying angular momentum : in quantum information processing , where qubit states of ion crystals are controlled , parasitic light shifts could be avoided as the ion is excited in the dark zone of the beam at zero electric field amplitude . such interactions also open the door to high dimensional entanglement between light and matter . in spectroscopy one might access transitions which have escaped excitation so far due to vanishing transition dipole moments .
