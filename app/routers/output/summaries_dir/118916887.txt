in [ gallego and aolita , physical review x 5 , 041008 ( 2015 ) ] , the authors proposed a definition for the relative entropy of steering and showed that the resulting quantity is a convex steering monotone . here we advocate for a different definition for relative entropy of steering , based on well grounded concerns coming from quantum shannon theory . we prove that this modified relative entropy of steering is a convex steering monotone . furthermore , we establish that it is uniformly continuous and faithful , in both cases giving quantitative bounds that should be useful in applications . we also consider a restricted relative entropy of steering which is relevant for the case in which the free operations in the resource theory of steering have a more restricted form ( the restricted operations could be more relevant in practical scenarios ) . the restricted relative entropy of steering is convex , monotone with respect to these restricted operations , uniformly continuous , and faithful .
