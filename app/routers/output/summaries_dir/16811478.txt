in this paper , we investigate the generalised monogamy inequalities of convex - roof extended negativity ( cren ) in multi - level systems . the generalised monogamy inequalities provide the upper and lower bounds of bipartite entanglement , which are obtained by using cren and the cren of assistance ( crenoa ) . furthermore , we show that the cren of multi - qubit pure states satisfies some monogamy relations . additionally , we test the generalised monogamy inequalities for qudits by considering the partially coherent superposition of a generalised w - class state in a vacuum and show that the generalised monogamy inequalities are satisfied in this case as well .
