many applications of magnetic resonance are limited by rapid loss of spin coherence caused by large transverse relaxation rates . in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) of large proteins , increased relaxation losses lead to poor sensitivity of experiments and increased measurement time . in this paper we develop broadband relaxation optimized pulse sequences ( bb - crop ) which approach fundamental limits of coherence transfer efficiency in the presence of very general relaxation mechanisms that include cross - correlated relaxation . these broadband transfer schemes use new techniques of chemical shift refocusing ( star echoes ) that are tailored to specific trajectories of coupled spin evolution . we present simulations and experimental data indicating significant enhancement in the sensitivity of multi - dimensional nmr experiments of large molecules by use of these methods .
