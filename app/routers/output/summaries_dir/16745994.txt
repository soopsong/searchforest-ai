synchronization of oscillations is a phenomenon prevalent in natural , social , and engineering systems . controlling synchronization of oscillating systems is motivated by a wide range of applications from neurological treatment of parkinson 's disease to the design of neurocomputers . in this article , we study the control of an ensemble of uncoupled neuron oscillators described by phase models . we examine controllability of such a neuron ensemble for various phase models and , furthermore , study the related optimal control problems . in particular , by employing pontryagin 's maximum principle , we analytically derive optimal controls for spiking single- and two - neuron systems , and analyze the applicability of the latter to an ensemble system . finally , we present a robust computational method for optimal control of spiking neurons based on pseudospectral approximations . the methodology developed here is universal to the control of general nonlinear phase oscillators .
