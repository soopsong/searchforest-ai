we generalize the differential representation of the operators of the galilean algebras to include fractional derivatives . as a result a whole new class of scale invariant galilean algebras are obtained . the first member of this class has dynamical index $ z=2 $ similar to the schr\"odinger algebra . the second member of the class has dynamical index $ z=3/2 $ , which happens to be the dynamical index kardar - parisi - zhang equation .
