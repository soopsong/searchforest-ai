spectrally unentangled biphotons with high single - spatiotemporal - mode purity are highly desirable for many quantum information processing tasks . we generate biphotons with an inferred heralded - state spectral purity of 99 % , the highest to date without any spectral filtering , by pulsed spontaneous parametric downconversion in a custom - fabricated periodically - poled ktiopo$_4 $ crystal under extended gaussian phase - matching conditions . to efficiently characterize the joint spectral intensity of the generated biphotons at high spectral resolution , we employ a commercially available dispersion compensation module ( dcm ) with a dispersion equivalent to 100 km of standard optical fiber and with an insertion loss of only 2.8 db . compared with the typical method of using two temperature - stabilized equal - length fibers that incurs an insertion loss of 20 db per fiber , the dcm approach achieves high spectral resolution in a much shorter measurement time . because the dispersion amount and center wavelengths of dcms can be easily customized , spectral characterization in a wide range of quantum photonic applications should benefit significantly from this technique .
