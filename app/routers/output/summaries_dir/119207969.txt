we investigate the transport properties and entanglement between spin and position of one - dimensional quantum walks starting from a qubit over position states following a delta - like ( local state ) and gaussian ( delocalized state ) distributions . we find out that if the initial state is delocalized enough and a not gate reflects this state backwards , then the interference pattern extinguishes the position dispersion without preventing the propagation of the state . this effect allows the creation of a trojan wave packet , a non - spreading and non - stationary double - peak quantum state .
