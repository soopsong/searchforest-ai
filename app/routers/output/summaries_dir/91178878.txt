we describe the coupling of moving atoms to a one dimensional photonic waveguide in the regime where the atomic velocities are comparable to the effective speed of light . such conditions could be achieved , for example , in photonic crystals or coupled resonator arrays , where the maximal photonic group velocity is significantly reduced compared to free space . in this case the interplay between a velocity - induced directionality and the emergence of new divergencies in the photonic density of states gives rise to a range of novel phenomena and non - perturbative effects in the emission of photons and the resulting photon - mediated interactions between moving atoms . we show that apart from potential implementations with optical waveguides , rydberg atoms flying above a coupled array of superconducting microwave resonators provide a versatile platform for exploring this new regime of atom - light interactions under experimentally accessible conditions .
