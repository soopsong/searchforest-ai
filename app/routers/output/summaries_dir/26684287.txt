quantum interference and quantum correlation , as two main features of quantum optics , play an essential role in quantum information applications , such as multi - particle quantum walk and boson sampling . while many experimental demonstrations have been done in one - dimensional waveguide arrays , it remains unexplored in higher dimensions due to tight requirement of manipulating and detecting photons in large - scale . here , we experimentally observe non - classical correlation of two identical photons in a fully coupled two - dimensional structure , i.e. photonic lattice manufactured by three - dimensional femtosecond laser writing . photon interference consists of 36 hong - ou - mandel interference and 9 bunching . the overlap between measured and simulated distribution is up to $ 0.890\pm0.001$. clear photon correlation is observed in the two - dimensional photonic lattice . combining with controllably engineered disorder , our results open new perspectives towards large - scale implementation of quantum simulation on integrated photonic chips .
