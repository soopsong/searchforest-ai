instantaneous nonlocal quantum computation refers to a process in which spacelike separated parties simulate a nonlocal quantum operation on their joint systems through the consumption of pre - shared entanglement . to prevent a violation of causality , this simulation succeeds up to local errors that can only be corrected after the parties communicate classically with one another . however , this communication is non - interactive , and it involves just the broadcasting of local measurement outcomes . we refer to this operational paradigm as local operations and broadcast communication ( lobc ) to distinguish it from the standard local operations and ( interactive ) classical communication ( locc ) . in this paper , we show that an arbitrary two - quibt gate can be implemented by lobc with $ \epsilon$-error using $ o(\log(1/\epsilon))$ entangled bits ( ebits ) . this offers an exponential improvement over the best known two - qubit protocols , whose ebit costs behave as $ o(1/\epsilon)$. we also consider the family of binary controlled gates on dimensions $ d_a\otimes d_b$. we find that any hermitian gate of this form can be implemented by lobc using a single shared ebit . in sharp contrast , a lower bound of $ \log d_b$ ebits is shown in the case of generic ( i.e. non - hermitian ) gates from this family , even when $ d_a=2$. this demonstrates an unbounded entanglement cost between locc and lobc gate implementation . furthermore , whereas previous lower bounds on the entanglement cost for instantaneous nonlocal computation restrict the minimum dimension of the needed entanglement , we bound its entanglement entropy . to our knowledge this is the first such lower bound of its kind .
