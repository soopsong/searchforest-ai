we attempt to analyze a one - dimensional space - inhomogeneous quantum walk ( qw ) with one defect at the origin , which has two different quantum coins in positive and negative parts . we call the qw"the two - phase qw " , which we treated concerning localization theorems [ 10 ] . the two - phase qw has been expected to be a mathematical model of the topological insulator [ 16 ] which is an intense issue both theoretically and experimentally [ 3,5,11 ] . in this paper , we derive the weak limit theorem describing the ballistic spreading , and as a result , we obtain the mathematical expression of the whole picture of the asymptotic behavior . our approach is based mainly on the generating function of the weight of the passages . we emphasize that the time - averaged limit measure is symmetric for the origin [ 10 ] , however , the weak limit measure is asymmetric , which implies that the weak limit theorem represents the asymmetry of the probability distribution .
