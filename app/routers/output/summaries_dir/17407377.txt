taking advantage of the two - parameter central extension of the planar galilei group , we construct a non relativistic particle model in the plane . owing to the extra structure , the coordinates do not commute . our model can be viewed as the non - relativistic counterpart of the relativistic anyon considered before by jackiw and nair . for a particle moving in a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane , the two parameters combine with the magnetic field to provide an effective mass . for vanishing effective mass the phase space admits a two - dimensional reduction , which represents the condensation to collective ` ` hall ' ' motions and justifies the rule called ` ` peierls substitution ' ' . quantization yields the wave functions proposed by laughlin to describe the fractional quantum hall effect .
