we show that a quantum - limited phase - preserving amplifier can act as a which - path information eraser when followed by heterodyne detection . this ' beam splitter with gain ' implements a continuous joint measurement on the signal sources . as an application , we propose heralded concurrent remote entanglement generation between two qubits coupled dispersively to separate cavities . dissimilar qubit - cavity pairs can be made indistinguishable by simple engineering of the cavity driving fields providing further experimental flexibility and the prospect for scalability . additionally , we find an analytic solution for the stochastic master equation , a quantum filter , yielding a thorough physical understanding of the nonlinear measurement process leading to an entangled state of the qubits . we determine the concurrence of the entangled states and analyze its dependence on losses and measurement inefficiencies .
