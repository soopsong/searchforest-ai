we analyse the smooth and sharp creation of a pointlike source for a quantised massless scalar field in $ ( 3 + 1)$-dimensional minkowski spacetime , as a model for the breakdown of correlations that has been proposed to occur at the horizon of an evaporating black hole . the creation is implemented by a time - dependent self - adjointness parameter at the excised spatial origin . in a smooth creation , the renormalised energy density $ \langle t_{00 } \rangle$ is well defined away from the source , but it is unbounded both above and below : the outgoing pulse contains an infinite negative energy , while a cloud of infinite positive energy lingers near the fully - formed source . in the sharp creation limit , $ \langle t_{00 } \rangle$ diverges everywhere in the timelike future of the creation event , and so does the response of an unruh - dewitt detector that operates in the timelike future of the creation event . the source creation is significantly more singular than the corresponding process in $ 1 + 1 $ dimensions , analysed previously , and it may be sufficiently singular to break quantum correlations as proposed in a black hole spacetime .
