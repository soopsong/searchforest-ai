we study the photon statistics of a cavity linearly coupled to an optomechanical system via second order correlation functions . our calculations show that the cavity can exhibit strong photon antibunching even when optomechanical interaction in the optomechanical system is weak . the cooperation between the weak optomechanical interaction and the destructive interference between different paths for two - photon excitation leads to the efficient antibunching effect . compared with the standard optomechanical system , the coupling between a cavity and an optomechanical system provides a method to relax the constraints to obtain single photon by optomechanical interaction .
