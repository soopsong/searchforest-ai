a rotation - based synthesis framework for reversible logic is proposed . we develop a canonical representation based on binary decision diagrams and introduce operators to manipulate the developed representation model . furthermore , a recursive functional bi - decomposition approach is proposed to automatically synthesize a given function . while boolean reversible logic is particularly addressed , our framework constructs intermediate quantum states that may be in superposition , hence we combine techniques from reversible boolean logic and quantum computation . the proposed approach results in quadratic gate count for multiple - control toffoli gates without ancillae , linear depth for quantum carry - ripple adder , and quasilinear size for quantum multiplexer .
