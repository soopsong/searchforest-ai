generative modeling is a flavor of machine learning with applications ranging from computer vision to chemical design . it is expected to be one of the techniques most suited to take advantage of the additional resources provided by near - term quantum computers . we implement a data - driven quantum circuit training algorithm on the canonical bars - and - stripes data set using a quantum - classical hybrid machine . the training proceeds by running parameterized circuits on a trapped ion quantum computer , and feeding the results to a classical optimizer . we apply two separate strategies , particle swarm and bayesian optimization to this task . we show that the convergence of the quantum circuit to the target distribution depends critically on both the quantum hardware and classical optimization strategy . our study represents the first successful training of a high - dimensional universal quantum circuit , and highlights the promise and challenges associated with hybrid learning schemes .
