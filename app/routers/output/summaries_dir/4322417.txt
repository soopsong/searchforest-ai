a phase transition describes the sudden change of state in a physical system , such as the transition between a fluid and a solid . quantum gases provide the opportunity to establish a direct link between experiment and generic models which capture the underlying physics . a fundamental concept to describe the collective matter - light interaction is the dicke model which has been predicted to show an intriguing quantum phase transition . here we realize the dicke quantum phase transition in an open system formed by a bose - einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity , and observe the emergence of a self - organized supersolid phase . the phase transition is driven by infinitely long - ranged interactions between the condensed atoms . these are induced by two - photon processes involving the cavity mode and a pump field . we show that the phase transition is described by the dicke hamiltonian , including counter - rotating coupling terms , and that the supersolid phase is associated with a spontaneously broken spatial symmetry . the boundary of the phase transition is mapped out in quantitative agreement with the dicke model . the work opens the field of quantum gases with long - ranged interactions , and provides access to novel quantum phases .
