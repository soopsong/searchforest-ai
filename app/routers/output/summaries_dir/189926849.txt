one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum circuit design is the concept of families of circuits parametrized by an instance size . as in classical programming , metaprogramming allows the programmer to write entire families of circuits simultaneously , an ability which is of particular importance in the context of quantum computing as algorithms frequently use arithmetic over non - standard word lengths . in this work , we introduce metaqasm , a typed extension of the openqasm language supporting the metaprogramming of circuit families . our language and type system , built around a lightweight implementation of sized types , supports subtyping over register sizes and is moreover type - safe . in particular , we prove that our system is strongly normalizing , and as such any well - typed metaqasm program can be statically unrolled into a finite circuit .
