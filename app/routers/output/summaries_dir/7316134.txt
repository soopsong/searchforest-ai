mechanical resonators based on low - dimensional materials are promising for force and mass sensing experiments . the force sensitivity in these ultra - light resonators is often limited by the imprecision in the measurement of the vibrations , the fluctuations of the mechanical resonant frequency , and the heating induced by the measurement . here , we strongly couple multilayer graphene resonators to superconducting cavities in order to achieve a displacement sensitivity of $ 1.3 $ fm hz$^{-1/2}$. this coupling also allows us to damp the resonator to an average phonon occupation of $ 7.2$. our best force sensitivity , $ 390 $ zn hz$^{-1/2}$ with a bandwidth of $ 200 $ hz , is achieved by balancing measurement imprecision , optomechanical damping , and heating . our results hold promise for studying the quantum capacitance of graphene , its magnetization , and the electron and nuclear spins of molecules adsorbed on its surface .
