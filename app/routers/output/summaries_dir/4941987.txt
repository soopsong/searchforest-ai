high - quality sources of single photons are of paramount importance for quantum communication , sensing and metrology . to these ends , resonantly excited two - level systems based on self - assembled quantum dots have recently generated widespread interest . nevertheless , we have recently shown that for resonantly excited two - level systems , emission of a photon during the presence of the excitation laser pulse and subsequent re - excitation results in a degradation of the obtainable single - photon purity . here , we demonstrate that generating single photons from self - assembled quantum dots with a scheme based on two - photon excitation of the biexciton strongly suppresses the re - excitation . specifically , the pulse - length dependence of the multi - photon error rate reveals a quadratic dependence in contrast to the linear dependence of resonantly excited two - level systems , improving the obtainable multi - photon error rate by several orders of magnitude for short pulses . we support our experiments with a new theoretical framework and simulation methodology to understand few - photon sources .
