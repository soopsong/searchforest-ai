we report a simple scheme for direct generation of frequency - bin entangled photon pairs via spontaneous parametric downconversion . our fabricated nonlinear optical crystal with two different poling periods can simultaneously satisfy two different , spectrally symmetric nondegenerate quasi - phase - matching conditions , enabling the direct generation of entanglement in two discrete frequency - bin modes . our produced photon pairs exhibited hong - ou - mandel interference with high - visibility beating oscillations , a signature of two - mode frequency - bin entanglement . moreover , we demonstrate deterministic entanglement - mode conversion from frequency - bin to polarization modes , with which our source can be more versatile for various quantum applications . our scheme can be extended to direct generation of high - dimensional frequency - bin entanglement , and thus will be a key technology for frequency - multiplexed optical quantum information processing .
