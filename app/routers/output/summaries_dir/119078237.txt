supervised learning algorithms take as input a set of labelled examples and return as output a predictive model . such models are used to estimate labels for future , previously unseen examples drawn from the same generating distribution . in this paper we investigate the possibility of using supervised learning to estimate the dimension of a non - markovian quantum environment . our approach uses an ensemble learning method , the random forest regressor , applied to classically simulated data sets . our results indicate this is a promising line of research .
