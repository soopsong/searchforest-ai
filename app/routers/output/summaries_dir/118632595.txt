entanglement in fermion many - body systems is studied using a generalized definition of separability based on partitions of the set of observables , rather than on particle tensor products . in this way , the characterizing properties of non - separable fermion states can be explicitly analyzed , allowing a precise description of the geometric structure of the corresponding state space . these results have direct applications in fermion quantum metrology : sub - shot noise accuracy in parameter estimation can be obtained without the need of a preliminary state entangling operation .
