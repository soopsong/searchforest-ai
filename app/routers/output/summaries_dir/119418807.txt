we present a time dependent quantum calculation of the scattering of a few - photon pulse on a single atom . the photon wave packet is assumed to propagate in a transversely strongly confined geometry , which ensures strong atom - light coupling and allows a quasi 1d treatment . the amplitude and phase of the transmitted , reflected and transversely scattered part of the wave packet strongly depend on the pulse length ( bandwidth ) and energy . for a transverse mode size of the order of $ \lambda^2 $ , we find nonlinear behavior for a few photons already , or even for a single photon . in a second step we study the collision of two such wave packets at the atomic site and find striking differences between fock state and coherent state wave packets of the same photon number .
