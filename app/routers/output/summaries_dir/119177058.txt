given an quantum dynamical semigroup expressed as an exponential superoperator acting on a space of n - dimensional density operators , eigenvalue methods are presented by which canonical kraus and lindblad operator sum representations can be computed . these methods provide a mathematical basis on which to develop novel algorithms for quantum process tomography , the statistical estimation of superoperators and their generators , from a wide variety of experimental data . theoretical arguments and numerical simulations are presented which imply that these algorithms will be quite robust in the presence of random errors in the data .
