the central challenge in trying to resolve the firewall paradox is to identify excitations in the near - horizon zone of a black hole that can carry information without injuring a freely falling observer . by analyzing the problem from the point of view of a freely falling observer , i arrive at a simple proposal for the degrees of freedom that carry information out of the black hole . an infalling observer experiences the information - carrying modes as ingoing , negative energy excitations of the quantum fields . in these states , freely falling observers who fall in from infinity do not encounter a firewall , but freely falling observers who begin their free fall from a location close to the horizon are"frozen"by a flux of negative energy . when the black hole is"mined,"the number of information - carrying modes increases , increasing the negative energy flux in the infalling frame without violating the equivalence principle . finally , i point out a loophole in recent arguments that an infalling observer must detect a violation of unitarity , effective field theory , or free infall .
