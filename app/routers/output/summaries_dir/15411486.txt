all quantum gates with one and two qubits may be described by elements of $ spin$ groups due to isomorphisms $ spin(3 ) \simeq su(2)$ and $ spin(6 ) \simeq su(4)$. however , the group of $ n$-qubit gates $ su(2^n)$ for $ n>2 $ has bigger dimension than $ spin(3n)$. a quantum circuit with one- and two - qubit gates may be used for construction of arbitrary unitary transformation $ su(2^n)$. analogously , the ` $ spin(3n)$ circuits ' are introduced in this work as products of elements associated with one- and two - qubit gates with respect to the above - mentioned isomorphisms . the matrix tensor product implementation of the $ spin(3n)$ group together with relevant models by usual quantum circuits with $ 2n$ qubits are investigated in such a framework . a certain resemblance with well - known sets of non - universal quantum gates e.g. , matchgates , noninteracting - fermion quantum circuits ) related with $ spin(2n)$ may be found in presented approach . finally , a possibility of the classical simulation of such circuits in polynomial time is discussed .
