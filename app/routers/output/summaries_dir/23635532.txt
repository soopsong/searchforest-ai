a joint measurement of two observables is a { \it simultaneous } measurement of both quantities upon the { \it same } quantum system . when two quantum - mechanical observables do not commute , then a joint measurement of these observables can not be accomplished by projective measurements alone . in this paper we shall discuss the use of quantum cloning to perform a joint measurement of two components of spin associated with a qubit system . we introduce a cloning scheme which is optimal with respect to this task . this cloning scheme may be thought to work by cloning two components of spin onto its outputs . we compare the proposed cloning machine to existing cloners .
