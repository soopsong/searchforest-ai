we experimentally study the phase stabilization of a semiconductor double quantum dot ( dqd ) single atom maser by injection locking . a voltage - biased dqd serves as an electrically tunable microwave frequency gain medium . the statistics of the maser output field demonstrate that the maser can be phase locked to an external cavity drive , with a resulting phase noise of -99 dbc / hz at a frequency offset of 1.3 mhz . the injection locking range , and the phase of the maser output relative to the injection locking input tone are in good agreement with adler 's theory . furthermore , the electrically tunable dqd energy level structure allows us to rapidly switch the gain medium on and off , resulting in an emission spectrum that resembles a frequency comb . the free running frequency comb linewidth is ~8 khz and can be improved to less than 1 hz by operating the comb in the injection locked regime .
