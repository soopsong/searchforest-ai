numerous inequalities involving moments of integrated intensities and revealing nonclassicality and entanglement in bipartite optical fields are derived using the majorization theory , non - negative polynomials , the matrix approach , as well as the cauchy - schwarz inequality . different approaches for deriving these inequalities are compared . using the experimental photocount histogram generated by a weak noisy twin beam monitored by a photon - number - resolving iccd camera the performance of the derived inequalities is compared . a basic set of ten inequalities suitable for monitoring the entanglement of a twin beam is suggested . inequalities involving moments of photocounts ( photon numbers ) as well as those containing directly the elements of photocount ( photon - number ) distributions are also discussed as a tool for revealing nonclassicality .
