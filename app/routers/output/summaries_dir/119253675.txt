to consider the entanglement between the spatial region $ a$ and its complement in a qft , we need to assign a hilbert space $ \mathcal{h}_a$ to the region , by making a certain choice on the boundary $ \partial a$. we argue that a small physical boundary is implicitly inserted at the entangling surface . we investigate these issues in the context of 2d cfts , and show that we can indeed read off the cardy states of the $ c=1/2 $ minimal model from the entanglement entropy of the critical ising chain .
