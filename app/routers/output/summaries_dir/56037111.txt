we propose quantum versions of the bell - ziv - zakai lower bounds on the error in multiparameter estimation . as an application we consider measurement of a time - varying optical phase signal with stationary gaussian prior statistics and a power law spectrum $ \sim 1/|\omega|^p$ , with $ p>1$. with no other assumptions , we show that the mean - square error has a lower bound scaling as $ 1/{\cal n}^{2(p-1)/(p+1)}$ , where $ { \cal n}$ is the time - averaged mean photon flux . moreover , we show that this accuracy is achievable by sampling and interpolation , for any $ p>1$. this bound is thus a rigorous generalization of the heisenberg limit , for measurement of a single unknown optical phase , to a stochastically varying optical phase .
