we present a new approach to engineering broadband sources of entangled photon pairs for quantum interferometry . the source is based on quasi - phase - matched spontaneous parametric down conversion in a titanium diffused periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide with a strongly - chirped poling period . the proposed non - standard asymmetric poling mitigates phase distortions associated with the process of chirping . asymmetric poling significantly broadens the entangled source bandwidth while preserving high visibility quantum interferometric sensing .
