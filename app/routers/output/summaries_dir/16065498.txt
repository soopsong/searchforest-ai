we investigate the influence of exciton - phonon coupling on the dynamics of a strongly coupled quantum dot - photonic crystal cavity system and explore the effects of this interaction on different schemes for non - classical light generation . by performing time - resolved measurements , we map out the detuning - dependent polariton lifetime and extract the spectrum of the polariton - to - phonon coupling with unprecedented precision . photon - blockade experiments for different pulse - length and detuning conditions ( supported by quantum optical simulations ) reveal that achieving high - fidelity photon blockade requires an intricate understanding of the phonons ' influence on the system dynamics . finally , we achieve direct coherent control of the polariton states of a strongly coupled system and demonstrate that their efficient coupling to phonons can be exploited for novel concepts in high - fidelity single photon generation .
