we consider ensembles of trajectories associated with large deviations of time - integrated quantities in stochastic models . motivated by proposals that these ensembles are relevant for physical processes such as shearing and glassy relaxation , we show how they can be generated directly using auxiliary stochastic processes . we illustrate our results using the glauber - ising chain , for which biased ensembles of trajectories can exhibit ferromagnetic ordering . we discuss the relation between such biased ensembles and quantum phase transitions .
