in this paper we investigate open string pair production effects near hyperbolic black holes in ads$_5$. we study the classical dynamics of d3 probe branes in this background and their quantum tunneling rate across the horizon from the inside using a method similar to that of kraus , parikh and wilczek . the hyperbolic black holes can decay through these tunneling events and their lifetime is estimated . the radiated branes move towards the boundary and do not bounce back . their world - lines do not intersect directly and they do not hit the singularity either , providing a clean scenario for studying the non - adiabatic pair production effects of open strings stretched between them near horizon . we find that there is a well defined parameter regime where there can be significant pair production . this requires the radiated branes to be highly boosted . however , the radiation of such branes still has small back - reaction on the black hole background , though the open string pair production on them can potentially alter the background . we comment on the possible relation of our model and the amps paradox . some issues and future directions are discussed in the end .
