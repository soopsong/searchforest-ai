we numerically study two non - interacting fermion models , a quantum wire model and a cherninsulator model , governed by open system linblad dynamics . the physical setup consists of a unitarilyevolving"bulk"coupled via its boundaries to two dissipative"leads " . the open system dynamics ischosen to drive the leads to thermal equilibrium , and by choosing different temperatures and chemicalpotentials for the two leads we may drive the bulk into a non - equilibrium current carrying steady state.we report two main results in this context . first , we show that for an appropriate choice of dynamicsof the leads , the bulk state is also driven to thermal equilibrium even though the open system dynamicsdoes not act directly on it . second , we show that the steady state which emerges at late time , even in thepresence of currents , is lightly entangled in the sense of having small mutual information and conditionalmutual information for appropriate regions . we also report some results for the rate of approach to thesteady state . these results have bearing on recent attempts to formulate a numerically tractable methodto compute currents in strongly interacting models ; specifically , they are relevant for the problem ofdesigning simple leads that can drive a target system into thermal equilibrium at low temperature .
