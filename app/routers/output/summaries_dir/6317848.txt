we propose a non - convex training objective for robust binary classification of data sets in which label noise is present . the design is guided by the intention of solving the resulting problem by adiabatic quantum optimization . two requirements are imposed by the engineering constraints of existing quantum hardware : training problems are formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization ; and model parameters are represented as binary expansions of low bit - depth . in the present work we validate this approach by using a heuristic classical solver as a stand - in for quantum hardware . testing on several popular data sets and comparing with a number of existing losses we find substantial advantages in robustness as measured by test error under increasing label noise . robustness is enabled by the non - convexity of our hardware - compatible loss function , which we name q - loss .
