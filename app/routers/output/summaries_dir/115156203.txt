we introduce a class of generalized geometric measures of entanglement . for pure quantum states of $ n$ elementary subsystems , they are defined as the distances from the sets of $ k$-separable states ( $ k=2, ... ,n$ ) . the entire set of generalized geometric measures provides a quantification and hierarchical ordering of the different bipartite and multipartite components of the global geometric entanglement , and allows to discriminate among the different contributions . the extended measures are applied to the study of entanglement in different classes of $ n$-qubit pure states . these classes include $ w$ and $ ghz$ states , and their symmetric superpositions ; symmetric multi - magnon states ; cluster states ; and , finally , asymmetric generalized $ w$-like superposition states . we discuss in detail a general method for the explicit evaluation of the multipartite components of geometric entanglement , and we show that the entire set of geometric measures establishes an ordering among the different types of bipartite and multipartite entanglement . in particular , it determines a consistent hierarchy between $ ghz$ and $ w$ states , clarifying the original result of wei and goldbart that $ w$ states possess a larger global entanglement than $ ghz$ states . furthermore , we show that all multipartite components of geometric entanglement in symmetric states obey a property of self - similarity and scale invariance with the total number of qubits and the number of qubits per party .
