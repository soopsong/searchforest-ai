the purpose of these notes is to discuss the relation between the additivity questions regarding the quantities ( holevo ) capacity of a quantum channel t and entanglement of formation of a given bipartite state . in particular , using the stinespring dilation theorem , we give a formula for the channel capacity involving entanglement of formation . this can be used to show that additivity of the latter for some states can be inferred from the additivity of capacity for certain channels . we demonstrate this connection for a family of group -- covariant channels , allowing us to calculate the entanglement cost for many states , including some where a strictly smaller upper bound on the distillable entanglement is known . group symmetry is used for more sophisticated analysis , giving formulas valid for a class of channels . this is presented in a general framework , extending recent findings of vidal , dur and cirac ( e - print quant - ph/0112131 ) . we speculate on a general relation of superadditivity of the entanglement of formation , which would imply both the general additivity of this function under tensor products and of the holevo capacity ( with or without linear cost constraints ) .
