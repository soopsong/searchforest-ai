model checking has been successfully applied to verification of computer hardware and software , communication systems and even biological systems . in this paper , we further push the boundary of its applications and show that it can be adapted for applications in quantum physics . more explicitly , we show how quantum statistical and many - body systems can be modeled as quantum markov chains , and some of their properties that interest physicists can be specified in linear - time temporal logics . then we present an efficient algorithm to check these properties . a few case studies are given to demonstrate the use of our algorithm to actual quantum physical problems .
