there is generally no obvious evidence in any direct relation between photon blockade and atomic coherence . here instead of only illustrating the photon statistics , we show an interesting relation between the steady - state photon blockade and the atomic coherence by designing a weakly driven cavity qed system with a two - level atom trapped . it is shown for the first time that the maximal atomic coherence has a perfect correspondence with the optimal photon blockade . the negative effects of the strong dissipations on photon statistics , atomic coherence and their correspondence are also addressed . the numerical simulation is also given to support all of our results .
