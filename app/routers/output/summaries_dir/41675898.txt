we have designed , fabricated and measured high - q $ \lambda/2 $ coplanar waveguide microwave resonators whose resonance frequency is made tunable with magnetic field by inserting a dc - squid array ( including 1 or 7 squids ) inside . their tunability range is 30 % of the zero field frequency . their quality factor reaches up to 3$\times10 ^ 4$. we present a model based on thermal fluctuations that accounts for the dependance of the quality factor with magnetic field .
