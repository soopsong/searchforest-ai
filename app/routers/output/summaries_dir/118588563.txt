we consider simulating the bcs hamiltonian , a model of low temperature superconductivity , on a quantum computer . in particular we consider conducting the simulation on the qubus quantum computer , which uses a continuous variable ancilla to generate interactions between qubits . we demonstrate an o(n^3 ) improvement over previous work conducted on an nmr computer [ prl 89 057904 ( 2002)&prl 97 050504 ( 2006 ) ] for the nearest neighbour and completely general cases . we then go on to show methods to minimise the number of operations needed per time step using the qubus in three cases ; a completely general case , a case of exponentially decaying interactions and the case of fixed range interactions . we make these results controlled on an ancilla qubit so that we can apply the phase estimation algorithm , and hence show that when n \geq 5 , our qubus simulation requires significantly less operations that a similar simulation conducted on an nmr computer .
