the concatenated greenberger - horne - zeiglinger ( c - ghz ) state which is a new type of logic - qubit entanglement has attracted a lot of attentions recently . we present a feasible entanglement concentration protocol ( ecp ) for logic - qubit entanglement . this ecp is based on the linear optics , and it does not know the initial coefficients of the less - entangled c - ghz state . this protocol can be extended to arbitrary c - ghz state . this protocol may be useful in future quantum information processing tasks .
