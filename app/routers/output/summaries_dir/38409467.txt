spin is an important quantum degree of freedom in relativistic quantum information theory . this paper provides a first - principles derivation of the observable corresponding to a stern - gerlach measurement with relativistic particle velocity . the specific mathematical form of the stern - gerlach operator is established using the transformation properties of the electromagnetic field . to confirm that this is indeed the correct operator we provide a detailed analysis of the stern - gerlach measurement process . we do this by applying a wkb approximation to the minimally coupled dirac equation describing an interaction between a massive fermion and an electromagnetic field . making use of the superposition principle we show that the +1 and -1 spin eigenstates of the proposed spin operator are split into separate packets due to the inhomogeneity of the stern - gerlach magnetic field . the operator we obtain is dependent on the momentum between particle and stern - gerlach apparatus , and is mathematically distinct from two other commonly used operators . the consequences for quantum tomography are considered .
