the speed of quantum gates and measurements is a decisive factor for the overall fidelity of quantum protocols when performed on physical qubits with finite coherence time . reducing the time required to distinguish qubit states with high fidelity is therefore a critical goal in quantum information science . the state - of - the - art readout of superconducting qubits is based on the dispersive interaction with a readout resonator . here , we bring this technique to its current limit and demonstrate how the careful design of system parameters leads to fast and high - fidelity measurements without affecting qubit coherence . we achieve this result by increasing the dispersive interaction strength , by choosing an optimal linewidth of the readout resonator , by employing a purcell filter , and by utilizing phase - sensitive parametric amplification . in our experiment , we measure 98.25 % readout fidelity in only 48 ns , when minimizing read - out time , and 99.2 % in 88 ns , when maximizing the fidelity , limited predominantly by the qubit lifetime of 7.6 us . the presented scheme is also expected to be suitable for integration into a multiplexed readout architecture .
