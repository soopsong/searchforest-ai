we consider in this paper a two - pulse photon echo sequence as a potential quantum light storage protocol . it is widely believed that a two - pulse scheme should lead to very low efficiency and is then not relevant for this specific application . we show experimentally by using a tm${}^{3+}$:yag crystal that such a protocol is on contrary very efficient and even too efficient to be considered as a good quantum storage protocol . our experimental work allows us to point out on one side the real limitations of this scheme and on the other side its benefits which can be a source of inspiration to conceive more promising procedures with rare - earth ion doped crystals .
