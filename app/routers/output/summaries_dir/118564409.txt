in this paper , based on the nonbinary graph state , we present a systematic way of constructing good non - binary quantum codes , both additive and nonadditive , for systems with integer dimensions . with the help of computer search , which results in many interesting codes including some nonadditive codes meeting the singleton bounds , we are able to construct explicitly four families of optimal codes , namely , $ [ [ 6,2,3]]_p$ , $ [ [ 7,3,3]]_p$ , $ [ [ 8,2,4]]_p$ and $ [ [ 8,4,3]]_p$ for any odd dimension $ p$ and a family of nonadditive code $ ( ( 5,p,3))_p$ for arbitrary $ p>3$. in the case of composite numbers as dimensions , we also construct a family of stabilizer codes $ ( ( 6,2\cdot p^2,3))_{2p}$ for odd $ p$ , whose coding subspace is { \em not } of a dimension that is a power of the dimension of the physical subsystem .
