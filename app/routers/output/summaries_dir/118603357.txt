the growing successes in performing quantum control experiments motivated the development of control landscape analysis as a basis to explain these findings.when a quantum system is controlled by an electromagnetic field , the observable as a functional of the control field forms a landscape . theoretical analyses have revealed many properties of control landscapes , especially regarding their slopes , curvatures , and topologies . a full experimental assessment of the landscape predictions is important for future consideration of controlling quantum phenomena . nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) is exploited here as an ideal laboratory setting for quantitative testing of the landscape principles . the experiments are performed on a simple two - level proton system in a h$_2$o - d$_2$o sample . we report a variety of nmr experiments roving over the control landscape based on estimation of the gradient and hessian , including ascent or descent of the landscape , level set exploration , and an assessment of the theoretical predictions on the structure of the hessian . the experimental results are fully consistent with the theoretical predictions . the procedures employed in this study provide the basis for future multispin control landscape exploration where additional features are predicted to exist .
