the existence of maximally incompatible quantum observables in the sense of a minimal joint measurability region is investigated . employing the universal quantum cloning device it is argued that only infinite dimensional quantum systems can accommodate maximal incompatibility . it is then shown that two of the most common pairs of complementary observables ( position and momentum ; number and phase ) are maximally incompatible .
