we present a waveguide - coupled photonic crystal h1 cavity structure in which the orthogonal dipole modes couple to spatially separated photonic crystal waveguides . coupling of each cavity mode to its respective waveguide with equal efficiency is achieved by adjusting the position and orientation of the waveguides . the behavior of the optimized device is experimentally verified for where the cavity mode splitting is larger and smaller than the cavity mode linewidth . in both cases , coupled q - factors up to 1600 and contrast ratios up to 10 are achieved . this design may allow for spin state readout of a self - assembled quantum dot positioned at the cavity center or function as an ultra - fast optical switch operating at the single photon level .
