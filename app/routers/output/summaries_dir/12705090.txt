memristors have been suggested as a novel route to neuromorphic computing based on the similarity between neurons ( synapses and ion pumps ) and memristors . the d.c . action of the memristor is a current spike , which we think will be fruitful for building memristor computers . in this paper , we introduce 4 different logical assignations to implement sequential logic in the memristor and introduce the physical rules , summation , ` bounce - back ' , directionality and ` diminishing returns ' , elucidated from our investigations . we then demonstrate how memristor sequential logic works by instantiating a not gate , an and gate and a full adder with a single memristor . the full adder makes use of the memristor 's memory to add three binary values together and outputs the value , the carry digit and even the order they were input in .
