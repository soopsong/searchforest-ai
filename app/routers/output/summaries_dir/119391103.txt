a natural measure in the space of density matrices describing n - dimensional quantum systems is proposed . we study the probability p that a quantum state chosen randomly with respect to the natural measure is not entangled ( is separable ) . we find analytical lower and upper bounds for this quantity . numerical calculations give p = 0.632 for n=4 and p=0.384 for n=6 , and indicate that p decreases exponentially with n. analysis of a conditional measure of separability under the condition of fixed purity shows a clear dualism between purity and separability : entanglement is typical for pure states , while separability is connected with quantum mixtures . in particular , states of sufficiently low purity are necessarily separable .
