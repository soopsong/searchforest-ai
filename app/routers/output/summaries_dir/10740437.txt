the possibility of in - memory computing with volatile memristive devices , namely , memristors requiring a power source to sustain their memory , is demonstrated . we have adopted a hysteretic graphene - based field emission structure as a prototype of volatile memristor , which is characterized by a non - pinched hysteresis loop . memristive model of the structure is developed and used to simulate a polymorphic circuit implementing in - memory computing gates such as the material implication . specific regions of parameter space realizing useful logic functions are identified . our results are applicable to other realizations of volatile memory devices .
