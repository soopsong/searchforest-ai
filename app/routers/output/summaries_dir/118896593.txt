we introduce a general class of toy models to study the quantum information - theoretic properties of black hole radiation . the models are governed by a set of isometries that specify how microstates of the black hole at a given energy evolve to entangled states of a tensor product black - hole / radiation hilbert space . the final state of the black hole radiation is conveniently summarized by a tensor network built from these isometries . we introduce a set of quantities generalizing the renyi entropies that provide a complete set of bipartite / multipartite entanglement measures , and give a general formula for the average of these over initial black hole states in terms of the isometries defining the model . for models where the dimension of the final tensor product radiation hilbert space is the same as that of the space of initial black hole microstates , the entanglement structure is universal , independent of the choice of isometries . in the more general case , we find that models which best capture the"information - free"property of black hole horizons are those whose isometries are tensors corresponding to states of tripartite systems with maximally mixed subsystems .
