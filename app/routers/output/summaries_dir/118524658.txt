i describe a method of inferring the past of quantum observables given the initial state and the subsequent measurement results using wigner quasi - probability representations . the method is proved to be compatible with logic for large subclasses of quantum systems , including those that involve incompatible observables and can still exhibit some quantum features , such as the uncertainty relation , measurement backaction , and entanglement .
