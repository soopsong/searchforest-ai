we study quantum teleportation between two different types of optical qubits using hybrid entanglement as a quantum channel under decoherence effects . one type of qubit employs the vacuum and single photon states for the basis , called a single - rail single - photon qubit , and the other utilizes coherent states of opposite phases . we find that teleportation from a single - rail single - photon qubit to a coherent state qubit is better than the opposite direction in terms of fidelity and success probability . we compare our results with those using a different type of hybrid entanglement between a polarized single - photon qubit and a coherent state .
