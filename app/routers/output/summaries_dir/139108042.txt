the morris - lecar model is arguably the simplest dynamical model that retains both the slow - fast geometry of excitable phase portraits and the physiological interpretation of a conductance - based model . we augment this model with one slow inward current to capture the additional property of bistability between a resting state and a spiking limit cycle . the resulting dynamical system is a core structure for many dynamical phenomena such as slow spiking and bursting . we show how the proposed model combines physiological interpretation and mathematical tractability and we discuss the benefits of the proposed approach with respect to alternative models in the literature .
