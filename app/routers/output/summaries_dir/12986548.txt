this is an exposition of some of the aspects of quantum computation and quantum information that have connections with operator theory . after a brief introduction , we discuss quantum algorithms . we outline basic properties of quantum channels , or equivalently , completely positive trace preserving maps . the main theorems for quantum error detection and correction are presented and we conclude with a description of a particular passive method of quantum error correction .
