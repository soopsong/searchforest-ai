it is commonly believed that the fidelity of quantum teleportation in the gravitational field would be degraded due to the heat up by the hawking radiation . in this paper , we point out that the hawking effect could be eliminated by the combined action of pre- and post - weak measurements , and thus the teleportation fidelity is almost completely protected . it is intriguing to notice that the enhancement of fidelity could not be attributed to the improvement of entanglement , but rather to the probabilistic nature of weak measurements . our work extends the ability of weak measurements as a quantum technique to battle against gravitational decoherence in relativistic quantum information .
