quantum computations are expressed in general as quantum circuits , which are specified by ordered lists of quantum gates . the resulting specifications are used during the optimisation and execution of the expressed computations . however , the specification format makes it difficult to verify that optimised or executed computations still conform to the initial gate list specifications : showing the computational equivalence between two quantum circuits expressed by different lists of quantum gates is exponentially complex in the worst case . in order to solve this issue , this work presents a derivation of the specification format tailored specifically for fault - tolerant quantum circuits . the circuits are considered a form consisting entirely of single qubit initialisations , cnot gates and single qubit measurements ( icm form ) . this format allows , under certain assumptions , to efficiently verify optimised ( or implemented ) computations . two verification methods based on checking stabiliser circuit structures are presented .
