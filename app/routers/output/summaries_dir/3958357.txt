we introduce a simple sub - universal quantum computing model , which we call the hadamard - classical circuit with one - qubit ( hc1q ) model . it consists of a classical reversible circuit sandwiched by two layers of hadamard gates , and therefore it is in the second level of the fourier hierarchy . we show that output probability distributions of the hc1q model can not be classically efficiently sampled within a multiplicative error unless the polynomial - time hierarchy collapses to the second level . the proof technique is different from those used for previous sub - universal models , such as iqp , boson sampling , and dqc1 , and therefore the technique itself might be useful for finding other sub - universal models that are hard to classically simulate . we also study the classical verification of quantum computing in the second level of the fourier hierarchy . to this end , we define a promise problem , which we call the probability distribution distinguishability with maximum norm ( pdd - max ) . it is a promise problem to decide whether output probability distributions of two quantum circuits are far apart or close . we show that pdd - max is bqp - complete , but if the two circuits are restricted to some types in the second level of the fourier hierarchy , such as the hc1q model or the iqp model , pdd - max has a merlin - arthur system with quantum polynomial - time merlin and classical probabilistic polynomial - time arthur .
