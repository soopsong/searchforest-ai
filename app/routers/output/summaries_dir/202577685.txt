the purpose of this paper is to study the interaction between a two - level system ( qubit ) and two continuous - mode photons . two scenarios are investigated : case 1 , how a two - level system changes the pulse shapes of two input photons propagating in a single input channel ; and case 2 , how a two - level system responds to two counter - propagating photons , one in each input channel . by means of a transfer function approach , the steady - state output field states for both cases are derived analytically in both the time and frequency domains . numerical simulations demonstrate rich and interesting two - photon scattering phenomena induced by a two - level system .
