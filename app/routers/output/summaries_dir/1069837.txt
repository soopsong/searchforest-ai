shor 's algorithm , which given appropriate hardware can factorise an integer $ n$ in a time polynomial in its binary length $ l$ , has arguable spurred the race to build a practical quantum computer . several different quantum circuits implementing shor 's algorithm have been designed , but each tacitly assumes that arbitrary pairs of qubits within the computer can be interacted . while some quantum computer architectures possess this property , many promising proposals are best suited to realising a single line of qubits with nearest neighbour interactions only . in light of this , we present a circuit implementing shor 's factorisation algorithm designed for such a linear nearest neighbour architecture . despite the interaction restrictions , the circuit requires just $ 2l+4 $ qubits and to first order requires $ 8l^{4}$ gates arranged in a circuit of depth $ 32l^{3}$ -- identical to first order to that possible using an architecture that can interact arbitrary pairs of qubits .
