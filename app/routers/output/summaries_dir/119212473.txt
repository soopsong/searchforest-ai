we propose a holographic entanglement negativity conjecture involving the bulk geometry , for mixed states of adjacent intervals in $ ( 1 + 1)$-dimensional dual conformal field theories through the $ ads / cft$ correspondence . the holographic entanglement negativity is obtained from a specific algebraic sum of the geodesics anchored on respective intervals on the boundary which reduces to the holographic mutual information between them . utilizing our conjecture we obtain the entanglement negativity of adjacent intervals in zero and finite temperature ( $ 1 + 1$)-dimensional holographic conformal field theories dual to the bulk $ ads_3 $ vacuum and the euclidean btz black hole respectively . our holographic conjecture exactly reproduces the conformal field theory results obtained through the replica technique , in the large central charge limit . we briefly elucidate the corresponding issue for the $ ads_{d+1}/cft_d$ scenario .
