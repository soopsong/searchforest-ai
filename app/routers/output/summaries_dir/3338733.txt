near - term quantum computers will soon reach sizes that are challenging to directly simulate , even when employing the most powerful supercomputers . yet , the ability to simulate these early devices using classical computers is crucial for calibration , validation , and benchmarking . in order to make use of the full potential of systems featuring multi- and many - core processors , we use automatic code generation and optimization of compute kernels , which also enables performance portability . we apply a scheduling algorithm to quantum supremacy circuits in order to reduce the required communication and simulate a 45-qubit circuit on the cori ii supercomputer using 8,192 nodes and 0.5 petabytes of memory . to our knowledge , this constitutes the largest quantum circuit simulation to this date . our highly - tuned kernels in combination with the reduced communication requirements allow an improvement in time - to - solution over state - of - the - art simulations by more than an order of magnitude at every scale .
