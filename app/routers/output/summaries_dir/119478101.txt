typically linear optical quantum computing ( loqc ) models assume that all input photons are completely indistinguishable . in practice there will inevitably be non - idealities associated with the photons and the experimental setup which will introduce a degree of distinguishability between photons . we consider a non - deterministic optical controlled - not gate , a fundamental loqc gate , and examine the effect of temporal and spectral distinguishability on its operation . we also consider the effect of utilizing non - ideal photon counters , which have finite bandwidth and time response .
