in this paper , we demonstrate that optimal control algorithms can be used to speed up the implementation of modules of quantum algorithms or quantum simulations in networks of coupled qubits . the gain is most prominent in realistic cases , where the qubits are not all mutually coupled . thus the shortest times obtained depend on the coupling topology as well as on the characteristicratio of the time scales for local controls { \em vs } non - local ( { \em i.e. } coupling ) evolutions in the specific experimental setting . relating these minimal times to the number of qubits gives the tightest known upper bounds to the actual time complexity of the quantum modules . as will be shown , time complexity is a more realistic measure of the experimental cost than the usual gate complexity . in the limit of fast local controls ( as { \em e.g. } in nmr ) , time - optimised realisations are shown for the quantum fourier transform ( qft ) and the multiply controlled { \sc not}-gate ( { \sc c$^{n-1}$not } ) in various coupling topologies of $ n$ qubits . the speed - ups are substantial : in a chain of six qubits the quantum fourier transform so far obtained by optimal control is more than eight times faster than the standard decomposition into controlled phase , hadamard and { \sc swap } gates , while the { \sc c$^{n-1}$not}-gate for completely coupled network of six qubits is nearly seven times faster .
