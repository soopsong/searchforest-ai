the interference of two independent single - photon pulses impinging on a beam splitter is analysed in a generalised time - resolved manner . different aspects of the phenomenon are elaborated using different representations of the single - photon wave packets , like the decomposition into single - frequency field modes or spatio - temporal modes matching the photonic wave packets . both representations lead to equivalent results , and a photon - by - photon analysis reveals that the quantum - mechanical two - photon interference can be interpreted as a classical one - photon interference once a first photon is detected . a novel time - dependent quantum - beat effect is predicted if the interfering photons have different frequencies . the calculation also reveals that full two - photon fringe visibility can be achieved under almost any circumstances by applying a temporal filter to the signal .
