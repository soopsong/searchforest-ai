we study the critical behavior of the nonequilibrium dynamics and of the steady states emerging from the competition between coherent and dissipative dynamics close to quantum phase transitions . the latter is induced by the coupling of the system with a markovian bath , such that the evolution of the system 's density matrix can be effectively described by a lindblad master equation . we devise general scaling behaviors for the out - of - equilibrium evolution and the stationary states emerging in the large - time limit for generic initial conditions , in terms of the parameters of the hamiltonian providing the coherent driving and those associated with the dissipative interactions with the environment . our framework is supported by numerical results for the dynamics of a one - dimensional lattice fermion gas undergoing a quantum ising transition , in the presence of dissipative mechanisms which include local pumping and decay of particles .
