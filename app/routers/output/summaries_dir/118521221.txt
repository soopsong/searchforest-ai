in quantum metrology quantum properties such as squeezing and entanglement are exploited in the design of a new generation of clocks , sensors and other measurement devices that can outperform their classical counterparts . applications of great technological relevance lie in the precise measurement of parameters which play a central role in relativity , such as proper accelerations , relative distances , time and gravitational field strengths . in this paper we generalise recently introduced techniques to estimate physical quantities within quantum field theory in flat and curved space - time . we consider a bosonic quantum field that undergoes a generic transformation , which encodes the parameter to be estimated . we present analytical formulas for optimal precision bounds on the estimation of small parameters in terms of bogoliubov coefficients for single mode and two - mode gaussian channels .
