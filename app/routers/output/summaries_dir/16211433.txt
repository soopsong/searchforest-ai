we present exact analytical solutions to study the coherent interaction between a single photon and the mechanical motion of a membrane in quadratic optomechanics . we consider single - photon emission and scattering when the photon is initially inside the cavity and in the fields outside the cavity , respectively . using our solutions , we calculate the single - photon emission and scattering spectra , and find relations between the spectral features and the system 's inherent parameters , such as : the optomechanical coupling strength , the mechanical frequency , and the cavity - field decay rate . in particular , we clarify the conditions for the phonon sidebands to be visible . we also study the photon - phonon entanglement for the long - time emission and scattering states . the linear entropy is employed to characterize this entanglement by treating it as a bipartite one between a single mode of phonons and a single photon .
