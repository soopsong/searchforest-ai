we propose a scheme able to generate stationary continuous variable entanglement between an optical and a microwave cavity mode by means of their common interaction with a micro - mechanical resonator . we show that when both cavities are intensely driven one can generate bipartite entanglement between any pair of the tripartite system , and that , due to entanglement sharing , optical - microwave entanglement is efficiently generated at the expense of microwave - mechanical and opto - mechanical entanglement .
