quantum repeaters rely on an interfacing of flying qubits with quantum memories . the most common implementations include a narrowband single photon matched in bandwidth and central frequency to an atomic system . previously , we demonstrated the compatibility of our versatile source of heralded single photons , which is based on parametric down - conversion in a triply - resonant whispering - gallery mode resonator , with alkaline transitions [ schunk et al . , optica 2 , 773 ( 2015 ) ] . in this paper , we analyze our source in terms of phase matching , available wavelength - tuning mechanisms , and applications to narrow - band atomic systems . we resonantly address the d1 transitions of cesium and rubidium with this optical parametric oscillator pumped above its oscillation threshold . below threshold , the efficient coupling of single photons to atomic transitions heralded by single telecom - band photons is demonstrated . finally , we present an accurate analytical description of our observations . providing the demonstrated flexibility in connecting various atomic transitions with telecom wavelengths , we show a promising approach to realize an essential building block for quantum repeaters .
