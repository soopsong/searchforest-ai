we evaluate the quantum discord dynamics of two qubits in independent and common non - markovian environments . we compare the dynamics of entanglement with that of quantum discord . for independent reservoirs the quantum discord vanishes only at discrete instants whereas the entanglement can disappear during a finite time interval . for a common reservoir , quantum discord and entanglement can behave very differently with sudden birth of the former but not of the latter . furthermore , in this case the quantum discord dynamics presents sudden changes in the derivative of its time evolution which is evidenced by the presence of kinks in its behavior at discrete instants of time .
