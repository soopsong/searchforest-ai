the recently reported violation of a bell inequality using entangled electronic spins in diamonds ( hensen et al . , nature 526 , 682 - 686 ) provided the first loophole - free evidence against local - realist theories of nature . here we report on data from a second bell experiment using the same experimental setup with minor modifications . we find a violation of the chsh - bell inequality of $ 2.35 \pm 0.18 $ , in agreement with the first run , yielding an overall value of $ s = 2.38 \pm 0.14$. we calculate the resulting $ p$-values of the second experiment and of the combined bell tests . we provide an additional analysis of the distribution of settings choices recorded during the two tests , finding that the observed distributions are consistent with uniform settings for both tests . finally , we analytically study the effect of particular models of random number generator ( rng ) imperfection on our hypothesis test . we find that the winning probability per trial in the chsh game can be bounded knowing only the mean of the rng bias , implying that our experimental result is robust for any model underlying the estimated average rng bias .
