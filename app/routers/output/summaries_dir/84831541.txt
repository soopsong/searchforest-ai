in this article we present an effective hamiltonian approach for discrete time quantum random walk . a form of the hamiltonian for one dimensional quantum walk has been prescribed , utilizing the fact that hamiltonians are the generators of time translations . then an attempt has been made to generalize the techniques to higher dimensions . we find that the hamiltonian can be written as the sum of a weyl hamiltonian and a dirac comb potential . the time evolution operator obtained from this prescribed hamiltonian is in complete agreement with that of the standard approach . but in higher dimension we find that the time evolution operator is additive , instead of being multiplicative \cite{chandrasekhar:2013srep08229 } . we showed that in case of two - step walk , effectively the time evolution operator can have multiplicative form . in case of a square lattice , quantum walk has been studied computationally for different coins and the results for both the additive and the multiplicative approaches have been compared . using the graphene hamiltonian the walk has been studied on a graphene lattice and we conclude the preference of additive approach over the multiplicative one .
