we present a construction of new quantum information measures that generalize the notion of logarithmic negativity . our approach is based on formal group theory . we shall prove that the family of generalized negativity functions we present are suitable for studying entanglement in many - body systems due their interesting algebraic properties . indeed , under mild hypotheses , the new measures are computable entanglement monotones , non - increasing under locc . also , they are composable : their evaluation over tensor products can be computed in terms of the evaluations over each factor , by means of a certain group law . in principle , being multi - parametric witnesses of entanglement , they could be useful to study separability and ( in perspective ) criticality of mixed states , playing a role similar to that of r\'enyi 's entanglement entropy in the discrimination of criticality and conformal sectors for pure states .
