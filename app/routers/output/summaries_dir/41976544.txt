a model of discrete dynamics of entanglement of bipartite quantum state is considered . it involves a global unitary dynamics of the system and periodic actions of local bistochastic or decaying channel . for initially pure states the decay of entanglement is accompanied with an increase of von neumann entropy of the system . we observe and discuss revivals of entanglement due to unitary interaction of both subsystems . for some mixed states having different marginal entropies of both subsystems ( one of them larger than the global entropy and the other one one smaller ) we find an asymmetry in speed of entanglement decay . the entanglement of these states decreases faster , if the depolarizing channel acts on the"classical"subsystem , characterized by smaller marginal entropy .
