we realise a quantum three - level system with photons distributed among three different spatial and polarization modes . ambiguous measurement of the state of the qutrit are realised by blocking one out for the three modes at any one time . using these measurements we construct a test of a leggett - garg inequality as well as tests of no - signalling - in - time for the measurements . we observe violations of the leggett - garg inequality that can not be accounted for in terms of signalling . moreover , we tailor the qutrit dynamics such that both ambiguous and unambiguous measurements are simultaneously non - signalling , which is an essential step for the justification of the use of ambiguous measurements in leggett - garg tests .
