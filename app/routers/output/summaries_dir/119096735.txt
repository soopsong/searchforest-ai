we perform an analysis of the optomechanical entanglement between the experimentally detectable output field of an optical cavity and a vibrating cavity end - mirror . we show that by a proper choice of the readout ( mainly by a proper choice of detection bandwidth ) one can not only detect the already predicted intracavity entanglement but also optimize and increase it . this entanglement is explained as being generated by a scattering process owing to which strong quantum correlations between the mirror and the optical stokes sideband are created . all - optical entanglement between scattered sidebands is also predicted and it is shown that the mechanical resonator and the two sideband modes form a fully tripartite - entangled system capable of providing practicable and robust solutions for continuous variable quantum communication protocols .
