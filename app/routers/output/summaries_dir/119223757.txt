we propose a new relativistic lorentz - invariant spin - noncommutative algebra . using the weyl ordering of noncommutative position operators , we build an analogue of the moyal - groenewald product for the proposed algebra . the lagrange function of an electromagnetic field in the space with spin noncommutativity is constructed . in such a space electromagnetic field becomes non - abelian . a gauge transformation law of this field is also obtained . exact nonlinear field equations of noncommutative electromagnetic field are derived from the least action principle . within the perturbative approach we consider field of a point charge in a constant magnetic field and interaction of two plane waves . an exact solution of a plane wave propagation in a constant magnetic and electric fields is found .
