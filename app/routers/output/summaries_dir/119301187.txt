a multi - user quantum key distribution protocol is proposed with single particles and the collective eavesdropping detection strategy on a star network . by utilizing this protocol , any two users of the network can accomplish quantum key distribution with the help of a serving center . due to the utilization of collective eavesdropping detection strategy , the users of the protocol just need have the ability of performing certain unitary operations . furthermore , we present three fault - tolerant versions of the proposed protocol , which can combat with the errors over different collective - noise channels . the security of all the proposed protocols is guaranteed by the theorems on quantum operation discrimination .
