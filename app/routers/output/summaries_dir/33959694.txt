perturbed hamming weight problems serve as examples of optimization instances for which the adiabatic algorithm provably out performs classical simulated annealing . in this work we study the efficiency of the adiabatic algorithm for solving the"the hamming weight with a spike"problem by using several methods to compute the scaling of the spectral gap at the critical point , which apply for various ranges of the height and width of the barrier . our main result is a rigorous polynomial lower bound on the minimum spectral gap for the adiabatic evolution when the bit - symmetric cost function has a thin but polynomially high barrier . this is accomplished by the use of a variational argument with an improved ansatz for the ground state , along with a comparison to the spectrum of the system when no spike term is present . we also give a more detailed treatment of the spin coherent path - integral instanton method which was used by farhi , goldstone , and gutmann in arxiv : quant - ph/0201031 , and consider its applicability for estimating the gap for different scalings of barrier height and width . we adapt the discrete wkb method for an abruptly changing potential , and apply it to the construction of approximate wave functions which can be used to estimate the gap . finally , the improved ansatz for the ground state leads to a method for predicting the location of avoided crossings in the excited states of the energy spectrum of the thin spike hamiltonian , and we use a recursion relation to determine the ordering of some of these avoided crossings , which may be a useful step towards understanding the diabatic cascade phenomenon which occurs in spike hamiltonians .
