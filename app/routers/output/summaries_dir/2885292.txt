we consider bosonic transport through one - dimensional spin systems . transport is induced by coupling the spin systems to bosonic reservoirs kept at different temperatures . in the limit of weak - coupling between spins and bosons we apply the quantum - optical master equation to calculate the energy transmitted from source to drain reservoirs . at large thermal bias , we find that the current for longitudinal transport becomes independent of the chain length and is also not drastically affected by the presence of disorder . in contrast , at small temperatures , the current scales inversely with the chain length and is further suppressed in presence of disorder . we also find that the critical behaviour of the ground state is mapped to critical behaviour of the current -- even in configurations with infinite thermal bias .
