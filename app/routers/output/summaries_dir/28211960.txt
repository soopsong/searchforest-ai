for two qubits independently coupled to their respective structured reservoirs ( lorentzian spectrum ) , quantum beats for entanglement and discord are found which are the result of quantum interference between correlation oscillations induced by local non - markovian environments . we also discuss the preservation of quantum correlations by the effective suppression of the spontaneous emission .
