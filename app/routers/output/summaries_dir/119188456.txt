we study the role of electron - phonon scattering for a pulse - triggered quantum dot single - photon source which utilizes a modified version of stimulated raman adiabatic passage and cavity - coupling . this on - demand source is coherently pumped with an optical pulse in the presence of a continuous wave laser drive , allowing for efficient generation of indistinguishable single photons with polarizations orthogonal to the applied fields . in contrast to previous studies , we explore the role of electron - phonon scattering on this semiconductor system by using a polaron master equation approach to model the biexciton - exciton cascade and cavity mode coupling . in addition to background zero - phonon - line decoherence processes , electron - acoustic - phonon coupling , which usually degrades the indistinguishability and efficiency of semiconductor photon sources , is rigorously taken into account . we study how cavity and laser detunings affect the device performance , and explore the effects of finite temperature on pure dephasing and intrinsic phonon - coupling . we describe how this biexciton - exciton cascade scheme allows for true single photons to be generated with over 90 % quantum indistinguishability and efficiency simultaneously using realistic experimental parameters . we also show how the double - field dressing can be probed through the cavity - emitted spectrum .
