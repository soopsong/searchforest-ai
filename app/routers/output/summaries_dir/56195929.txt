the development of a large scale quantum computer is a highly sought after goal of fundamental research and consequently a highly non - trivial problem . scalability in quantum information processing is not just a problem of qubit manufacturing and control but it crucially depends on the ability to adapt advanced techniques in quantum information theory , such as error correction , to the experimental restrictions of assembling qubit arrays into the millions . in this paper we introduce a feasible architectural design for large scale quantum computation in optical systems . we combine the recent developments in topological cluster state computation with the photonic module , a simple chip based device which can be used as a fundamental building block for a large scale computer . the integration of the topological cluster model with this comparatively simple operational element addresses many significant issues in scalable computing and leads to a promising modular architecture with complete integration of active error correction exhibiting high fault - tolerant thresholds .
