it is well known that the edge vector space of an oriented graph can be decomposed in terms of cycles and cocycles ( alias cuts , or bonds ) , and that a basis for the cycle and the cocycle spaces can be generated by adding and removing edges to an arbitrarily chosen spanning tree . in this paper we show that the edge vector space can also be decomposed in terms of cycles and the generating edges of cocycles ( called cochords ) , or of cocycles and the generating edges of cycles ( called chords ) . from this observation follows a construction in terms of oblique complementary projection operators . we employ this algebraic construction to prove several properties of unweighted kirchhoff - symanzik matrices , encoding the mutual superposition between cycles and cocycles . in particular , we prove that dual matrices of planar graphs have the same spectrum ( up to multiplicities ) . we briefly comment on how this construction provides a refined formalization of kirchhoff 's mesh analysis of electrical circuits , which has lately been applied to generic thermodynamic networks .
