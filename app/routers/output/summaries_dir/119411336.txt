noise and decoherence are two major obstacles to the implementation of large - scale quantum computing . because of the no - cloning theorem , which says we can not make an exact copy of an arbitrary quantum state , simple redundancy will not work in a quantum context , and unwanted interactions with the environment can destroy coherence and thus the quantum nature of the computation . because of the parallel and distributed nature of classical neural networks , they have long been successfully used to deal with incomplete or damaged data . in this work , we show that our model of a quantum neural network ( qnn ) is similarly robust to noise , and that , in addition , it is robust to decoherence . moreover , robustness to noise and decoherence is not only maintained but improved as the size of the system is increased . noise and decoherence may even be of advantage in training , as it helps correct for overfitting . we demonstrate the robustness using entanglement as a means for pattern storage in a qubit array . our results provide evidence that machine learning approaches can obviate otherwise recalcitrant problems in quantum computing .
