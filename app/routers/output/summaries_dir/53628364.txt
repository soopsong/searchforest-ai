efficient operation sequences to couple and interchange quantum information between quantum dot spin qubits of different kinds are derived using exchange interactions . in the qubit encoding of a single - spin qubit , a singlet - triplet qubit , and an exchange - only ( triple - dot ) qubit , some of the single - qubit interactions remain on during the entangling operation ; this greatly simplifies the operation sequences that construct entangling operations . in the ideal setup , the gate operations use the intra - qubit exchange interactions only once . the limitations of the entangling sequences are discussed , and it is shown how quantum information can be converted between different kinds of quantum dot spin qubits .
