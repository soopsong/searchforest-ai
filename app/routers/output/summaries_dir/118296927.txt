the generation of pseudo - random discrete probability distributions is of paramount importance for a wide range of stochastic simulations spanning from monte carlo methods to the random sampling of quantum states for investigations in quantum information science . in spite of its significance , a thorough exposition of such a procedure is lacking in the literature . in this article we present relevant details concerning the numerical implementation and applicability of what we call the iid , normalization , and trigonometric methods for generating an unbiased probability vector $ \mathbf{p}=(p_{1},\cdots , p_{d})$. an immediate application of these results regarding the generation of pseudo - random pure quantum states is also described .
