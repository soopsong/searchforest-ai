counter - intuitively , quantum mechanics enables quantum particles to propagate simultaneously among multiple space - time trajectories . hence , a quantum information carrier can travel through different communication channels in a quantum superposition of different orders , so that the relative time - order of the communication channels becomes indefinite . this is realized by utilizing a quantum device known as quantum switch . in this paper , we investigate , from a communication - engineering perspective , the use of the quantum switch within the quantum teleportation process , one of the key functionalities of the quantum internet . specifically , a theoretical analysis is conducted to quantify the performance gain that can be achieved by employing a quantum switch for the entanglement distribution process within the quantum teleportation with respect to the case of absence of quantum switch . this analysis reveals that , by utilizing the quantum switch , the quantum teleportation is heralded as a noiseless communication process with a probability that , remarkably and counter - intuitively , increases with the noise levels affecting the communication channels considered in the indefinite - order time combination .
