the laws of physics play a crucial role in the security of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) . this fact has often been misunderstood as if the security of qkd would be based only on the laws of physics . as the experts know well , things are more subtle . we review the progresses in practical qkd focusing on ( i ) the elements of trust that are common to classical and quantum implementations of key distribution ; and ( ii ) some threats to security that have been highlighted recently , none of which is unredeemable ( i.e. , in principle qkd can be made secure ) . this leads us to guess that the field , similar to non - quantum modern cryptography , is going to split in two directions : those who pursue practical devices may have to moderate their security claims ; those who pursue ultimate security may have to suspend their claims of usefulness .
