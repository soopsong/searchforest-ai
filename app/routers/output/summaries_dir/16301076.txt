this paper strengthens the interpretation and understanding of the classical capacity of the pure - loss bosonic channel , first established in [ giovannetti et al . , physical review letters 92 , 027902 ( 2004 ) , arxiv : quant - ph/0308012 ] . in particular , we first prove that there exists a trade - off between communication rate and error probability if one imposes only a mean - photon number constraint on the channel inputs . that is , if we demand that the mean number of photons at the channel input can not be any larger than some positive number n_s , then it is possible to respect this constraint with a code that operates at a rate g(\eta n_s / ( 1-p ) ) where p is the code 's error probability , \eta\ is the channel transmissivity , and g(x ) is the entropy of a bosonic thermal state with mean photon number x. we then prove that a strong converse theorem holds for the classical capacity of this channel ( that such a rate - error trade - off can not occur ) if one instead demands for a maximum photon number constraint , in such a way that mostly all of the"shadow"of the average density operator for a given code is required to be on a subspace with photon number no larger than n n_s , so that the shadow outside this subspace vanishes as the number n of channel uses becomes large . finally , we prove that a small modification of the well - known coherent - state coding scheme meets this more demanding constraint .
