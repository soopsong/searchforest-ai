with this work we elaborate on the physics of quantum noise in thermal equilibrium and in stationary non - equilibrium . starting out from the celebrated quantum fluctuation - dissipation theorem we discuss some important consequences that must hold for open , dissipative quantum systems in thermal equilibrium . the issue of quantum dissipation is exemplified with the fundamental problem of a damped harmonic quantum oscillator . the role of quantum fluctuations is discussed in the context of both , the nonlinear generalized quantum langevin equation and the path integral approach . we discuss the consequences of the time - reversal symmetry for an open dissipative quantum dynamics and , furthermore , point to a series of subtleties and possible pitfalls . the path integral methodology is applied to the decay of metastable states assisted by quantum brownian noise .
