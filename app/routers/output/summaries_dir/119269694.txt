we give a direct alternative proof of an area law for the entanglement entropy of the ground state of disordered oscillator systems --- a result due to nachtergaele , sims and stolz . instead of studying the logarithmic negativity , we invoke the explicit formula for the entanglement entropy of gaussian states to derive the upper bound . we also contrast this area law in the disordered case with divergent lower bounds on the entanglement entropy of the ground state of one - dimensional ordered oscillator chains .
