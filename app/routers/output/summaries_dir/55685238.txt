a key ingredient for quantum photonic technologies is an on - demand source of indistinguishable single photons . state - of - the - art indistinguishable single - photon sources typically employ resonant excitation pulses with fixed repetition rates , creating a string of single photons with predetermined arrival times . however , in future applications , an independent electronic signal from a larger quantum circuit or network will trigger the generation of an indistinguishable photon . further , operating the photon source up to the limit imposed by its lifetime is desirable . here , we report on the application of a true on - demand approach in which we can electronically trigger the precise arrival time of a single photon as well as control the excitation pulse duration based on resonance fluorescence from a single inas / gaas quantum dot . we investigate in detail the effect of the finite duration of an excitation $ \pi$ pulse on the degree of photon antibunching . finally , we demonstrate that highly indistinguishable single photons can be generated using this on - demand approach , enabling maximum flexibility for future applications .
