reflectance and transmittance of graphene in the optical region are analyzed as a function of frequency , temperature , and carrier density . we show that the optical graphene properties are determined by the direct interband electron transitions . the real part of the dynamic conductivity in doped graphene at low temperatures takes the universal constant value , whereas the imaginary part is logarithmically divergent at the threshold of interband transitions .
