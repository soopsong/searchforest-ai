the evolution of two , non - interacting two - level atoms immersed in a weakly coupled bath can be described by a refined , time coarse grained markovian evolution , still preserving complete positivity . we find that this improved reduced dynamics is able to entangle the two atoms even when their internal frequencies are unequal , an effect which appears impossible in the standard weak coupling limit approach . we study in detail this phenomenon for an environment made of quantum fields .
