jaeger , vertigan , and welsh [ 15 ] proved a dichotomy for the complexity of evaluating the tutte polynomial at fixed points : the evaluation is # p - hard almost everywhere , and the remaining points admit polynomial - time algorithms . dell , husfeldt , and wahl\'en [ 9 ] and husfeldt and taslaman [ 12 ] , in combination with curticapean [ 7 ] , extended the # p - hardness results to tight lower bounds under the counting exponential time hypothesis # eth , with the exception of the line $ y=1 $ , which was left open . we complete the dichotomy theorem for the tutte polynomial under # eth by proving that the number of all acyclic subgraphs of a given $ n$-vertex graph can not be determined in time $ exp(o(n))$ unless # eth fails . another dichotomy theorem we strengthen is the one of creignou and hermann [ 6 ] for counting the number of satisfying assignments to a constraint satisfaction problem instance over the boolean domain . we prove that all # p - hard cases are also hard under # eth . the main ingredient is to prove that the number of independent sets in bipartite graphs with $ n$ vertices can not be computed in time $ exp(o(n))$ unless # eth fails . in order to prove our results , we use the block interpolation idea by curticapean [ 7 ] and transfer it to systems of linear equations that might not directly correspond to interpolation .
