necessary and sufficient conditions for the nonclassicality of bosonic quantum states are formulated by introducing nonclassicality filters and nonclassicality quasiprobability distributions . regular quasiprobabilities are constructed from characteristic functions which can be directly sampled by balanced homodyne detection . their negativities uncover the nonclassical effects of general quantum states . the method is illustrated by visualizing the nonclassical nature of a squeezed state .
