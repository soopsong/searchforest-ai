we consider the electromagnetic vacuum field inside a perfect plane cavity with moving mirrors , in the nonrelativistic approximation . we show that low frequency photons are generated in pairs that satisfy simple properties associated to the plane geometry . we calculate the photon generation rates for each polarization as functions of the mechanical frequency by two independent methods : on one hand from the analysis of the boundary conditions for moving mirrors and with the aid of green functions ; and on the other hand by an effective hamiltonian approach . the angular and frequency spectra are discrete , and emission rates for each allowed angular direction are obtained . we discuss the dependence of the generation rates on the cavity length and show that the effect is enhanced for short cavity lengths . we also compute the dissipative force on the moving mirrors and show that it is related to the total radiated energy as predicted by energy conservation .
