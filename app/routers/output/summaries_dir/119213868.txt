we propose a general measure of non - classical correlations for bipartite systems based on generalized entropic functions and majorization properties . defined as the minimum information loss due to a local measurement , in the case of pure states it reduces to the generalized entanglement entropy , i.e. , the generalized entropy of the reduced state . however , in the case of mixed states it can be non - zero in separable states , vanishing just for states diagonal in a general product basis , like the quantum discord . simple quadratic measures of quantum correlations arise as a particular case of the present formalism . the minimum information loss due to a joint local measurement is also discussed . the evaluation of these measures in a few simple relevant cases is as well provided , together with comparison with the corresponding entanglement monotones .
