we consider the problem of quantum phase estimation with access to arbitrary measurements in a single suboptimal basis . the achievable sensitivity limit in this case is determined by the classical cram\'{e}r - rao bound with respect to the fixed basis . here we show that the sensitivity can be enhanced beyond this limit if knowledge about the energy expectation value is available . the combined information is shown to be equivalent to a direct measurement of an optimal linear combination of the basis projectors and the phase - imprinting hamiltonian . application to an atomic clock with oversqueezed spin states yields a sensitivity gain that scales linearly with the number of atoms . our analysis further reveals that small modifications of the observable can have a strong impact on the sensitivity .
