we study the statistical and dynamical aspects of a translation - invariant hamiltonian , without quench disorder , as an example of the manifestation of the phenomenon of many - body localization . this is characterized by the breakdown of thermalization and by information preservation of initial preparations at long times . to realize this , we use quasi - periodic long - range interactions , which are now achievable in high - finesse cavity experiments , to find evidence suggestive of a divergent time - scale in which charge inhomogeneities in the initial state survive asymptotically . this is reminiscent of a glassy behavior , which appears in the ground - state of this system , being also present at infinite temperatures .
