the long - standing problem of finding a closed formula for the relative entropy of entanglement ( ree ) for two qubits is addressed . a compact - form solution to the inverse problem , which characterizes an entangled state for a given closest separable state , is obtained . analysis of the formula for a large class of entangled states strongly suggests that a compact analytical solution of the original problem , which corresponds to finding the closest separable state for a given entangled state , can be given only in some special cases . a few applications of the compact - form formula are given to show additivity of the ree , to relate the ree with the rains upper bound for distillable entanglement , and to show that a bell state does not have a unique closest separable state .
