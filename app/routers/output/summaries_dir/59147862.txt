we apply the continuous variable approach to study entangled dynamics of coupled harmonic oscillators interacting with a thermal reservoir and to a deterministic creation of entanglement in an atomic ensemble located inside a high - q ring cavity . in the case of harmonic oscillators , we show that a suitable unitary transformation of the position and momentum operators transforms the system to a set of independent harmonic oscillators with only one of them coupled to the reservoir . working in the wigner representation of the density operator , we find that the covariance matrix has a block diagonal form of smaller size matrices . this simple property allows to treat the problem to some extend analytically . we analyze the time evolution of an initial entanglement and find that the entanglement can persists for long times due to presence of constants of motion for the covariance matrix elements . in the case of an atomic ensemble located inside the cavity , the attention is focused on creation of one and two - mode continuous variable entangled states from the vacuum by applying laser pulses of a suitably adjusted amplitudes and phases . the pulses together with the cavity dissipation prepare the collective modes of the atomic ensemble in a desired entangled state .
