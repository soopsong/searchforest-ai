maximally entangled mixed states are those states that , for a given mixedness , achieve the greatest possible entanglement . for two - qubit systems and for various combinations of entanglement and mixedness measures , the form of the corresponding maximally entangled mixed states is determined primarily analytically . as measures of entanglement , we consider entanglement of formation , relative entropy of entanglement , and negativity ; as measures of mixedness , we consider linear and von neumann entropies . we show that the forms of the maximally entangled mixed states can vary with the combination of ( entanglement and mixedness ) measures chosen . moreover , for certain combinations , the forms of the maximally entangled mixed states can change discontinuously at a specific value of the entropy .
