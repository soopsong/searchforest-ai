we have used diffraction gratings to simplify the fabrication , and dramatically increase the atomic collection efficiency , of magneto - optical traps using micro - fabricated optics . the atom number enhancement was mainly due to the increased beam capture volume , afforded by the large area ( 4cm^2 ) shallow etch ( 200 nm ) binary grating chips . here we provide a detailed theoretical and experimental investigation of the on - chip magneto - optical trap temperature and density in four different chip geometries using 87rb , whilst studying effects due to mot radiation pressure imbalance . with optimal initial mots on two of the chips we obtain both large atom number ( 2x10 ^ 7 ) _ and _ sub - doppler temperatures ( 50uk ) after optical molasses .
