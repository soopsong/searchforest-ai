we present three designs for planar superconducting microwave resonators for electron spin resonance ( esr ) experiments . we implement finite element simulations to calculate the resonance frequency and quality factors as well as the three - dimensional microwave magnetic field distribution of the resonators . one particular resonator design offers an increased homogeneity of the microwave magnetic field while the other two show a better confinement of the mode volume . we extend our model simulations to calculate the collective coupling rate between a spin ensemble and a microwave resonator in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic resonator field . continuous - wave esr experiments of phosphorus donors in $ ^\mathrm{nat}$si demonstrate the feasibility of our resonators for magnetic resonance experiments . we extract the collective coupling rate and find a good agreement with our simulation results , corroborating our model approach . finally , we discuss specific application cases for the different resonator designs .
