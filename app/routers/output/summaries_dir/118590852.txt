optical nanofibres are used to confine light to subwavelength regions and are very promising tools for the development of optical fibre - based quantum networks using cold , neutral atoms . to date , experimental studies on atoms near nanofibres have focussed on fundamental fibre mode interactions . in this work , we demonstrate the integration of a few - mode optical nanofibre into a magneto - optical trap for $ ^{87}$rb atoms . the nanofibre , with a waist diameter of $ \sim$700 nm , supports both the fundamental and first group of higher order modes and is used for atomic fluorescence and absorption studies . in general , light propagating in higher order fibre modes has a greater evanescent field extension around the waist in comparison with the fundamental mode . by exploiting this behaviour , we demonstrate that the detected signal of fluorescent photons emitted from a cloud of cold atoms centred at the nanofibre waist is larger ( $ \sim$6 times ) when higher order guided modes are considered as compared to the fundamental mode . absorption of on - resonance , higher order mode probe light by the laser - cooled atoms is also observed . these advances should facilitate the realisation of atom trapping schemes based on higher order mode interference .
