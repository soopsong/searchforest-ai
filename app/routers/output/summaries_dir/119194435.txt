many of the standard bell inequalities ( e.g. , chsh ) are not effective for detection of quantum correlations which allow for steering , because for a wide range of such correlations they are not violated . we present bell - like inequalities which have lower bounds for non - steering correlations than for local causal models . the inequalities involve all possible measurement settings at each side . we arrive at interesting and elegant conditions for steerability of arbitrary two - qubit states .
