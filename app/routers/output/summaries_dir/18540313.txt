we present the constructon and detailed analysis of highly - optimized self - refocusing pulse shapes for several rotation angles . we characterize the constructed pulses by the coefficients appearing in the magnus expansion up to second order . this allows a semi - analytical analysis of the performance of the constructed shapes in sequences and composite pulses by computing the corresponding leading - order error operators . higher orders can be analyzed with the numerical technique suggested by us previously . we illustrate the technique by analysing several composite pulses designed to protect against pulse amplitude errors , and on decoupling sequences for potentially long chains of qubits with on - site and nearest - neighbor couplings .
