the advent of microfabricated ion traps for the quantum information community has allowed research groups to build traps that incorporate an unprecedented number of trapping zones . however , as device complexity has grown , the number of digital - to - analog converter ( dac ) channels needed to control these devices has grown as well , with some of the largest trap assemblies now requiring nearly one hundred dac channels . providing electrical connections for these channels into a vacuum chamber can be bulky and difficult to scale beyond the current numbers of trap electrodes . this paper reports on the development and testing of an in - vacuum dac system that uses only 9 vacuum feedthrough connections to control a 78-electrode microfabricated ion trap . the system is characterized by trapping single and multiple $ ^{40}$ca$^+$ ions . the measured axial mode stability , ion heating rates , and transport fidelities for a trapped ion are comparable to systems with external(air - side ) commercial dacs .
