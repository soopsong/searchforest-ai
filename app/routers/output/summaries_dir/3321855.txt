the electron - positron annihilation into two photons is a standard technology in medicine to observe e.g. metabolic processes in human bodies . a new tomograph will provide the possibility to observe not only direct $ e^+ e^-$ annihilations but also the $ 3 $ photons from the decay of ortho - positronium atoms formed in the body . we show in this contribution that the three - photon state with respect to polarisation degrees of freedom depends on the angles between the photons and exhibits various specific entanglement features . in particular genuine multipartite entanglement , a type of entanglement involving all degrees of freedoms , is subsistent if the positronium was in a definite spin eigenstate . remarkably , when all spin eigenstates are mixed equally , entanglement --and even stronger genuine multipartite entanglement-- survives . due to a"\textit{symmetrization}"process , however , $ dicke$-type of entanglement remains whereas $ ghz$-type of entanglement vanishes . the survival of particular entanglement properties in the mixing scenario may make it possible to extract quantum information in form of distinct entanglement features , e.g. , from metabolic processes in human bodies .
