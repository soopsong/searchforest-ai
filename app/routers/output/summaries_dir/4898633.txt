the temperature of the semiconductor diode increases under strong light illumination whether thermoelectric cooler is installed or not , which changes the output wavelength of the laser ( lee m. s. et al . , 2017 ) . however , other characteristics also vary as temperature increases . these variations may help the eavesdropper in practical quantum key distribution systems . we study the effects of temperature increase on gain - switched semiconductor lasers by simulating temperature dependent rate equations . the results show that temperature increase may cause large intensity fluctuation , decrease the output intensity and lead the signal state and decoy state distinguishable . we also propose a modified photon number splitting attack by exploiting the effects of temperature increase . countermeasures are also proposed .
