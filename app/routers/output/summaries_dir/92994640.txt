we theoretically study hawking radiation processes from an analog acoustic black hole in a flowing superfluid of exciton - polaritons in a one - dimensional semiconductor microcavity . polaritons are coherently injected into the microcavity by a laser pump with a suitably tailored spot profile . an event horizon with a large analog surface gravity is created by inserting a defect in the polariton flow along the cavity plane . experimentally observable signatures of the analog hawking radiation are identified in the scattering of phonon wavepackets off the horizon , as well as in the spatial correlation pattern of quantum fluctuations of the polariton density . the potential of these table - top optical systems as analog models of gravitational physics is quantitatively confirmed by numerical calculations using realistic parameters for state - of - the - art devices .
