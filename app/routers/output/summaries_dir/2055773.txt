we theoretically and experimentally investigate the spectral tunability and purity of photon pairs generated from spontaneous parametric down conversion in periodically poled $ \mathrm{ktiopo_4}$ crystal with group - velocity matching condition . the numerical simulation predicts that the purity of joint spectral intensity ( $ p_{jsi}$ ) and the purity of joint spectral amplitude ( $ p_{jsa}$ ) can be kept higher than 0.98 and 0.81 , respectively , when the wavelength is tuned from 1460 nm to 1675 nm , which covers the s- , c- , l- , and u - band in telecommunication wavelengths . we also directly measured the joint spectral intensity at 1565 nm , 1584 nm and 1565 nm , yielding $ p_{jsi}$ of 0.989 , 0.983 and 0.958 , respectively . such a photon source is useful for quantum information and communication systems .
