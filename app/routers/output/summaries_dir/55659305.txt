a proof of bell 's theorem without inequalities valid for both inequivalent classes of three - qubit entangled states under local operations assisted by classical communication , namely greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) and w , is described . this proof leads to a bell inequality that allows more conclusive tests of bell 's theorem for three - qubit systems . another bell inequality involving both tri- and bipartite correlations is introduced which illustrates the different violations of local realism exhibited by the ghz and w states .
