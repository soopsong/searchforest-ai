this paper is concerned with linear stochastic control systems in state space . the integral of the squared norm of the system output over a bounded time interval is interpreted as energy . the cumulants of the output energy in the infinite - horizon limit are related to schatten norms of the system in the hardy space of transfer functions and the risk - sensitive performance index . we employ a novel performance criterion which seeks to minimize a combination of the average value and the variance of the output energy of the system per unit time . the resulting linear quadro - quartic gaussian control problem involves the h2 and h4-norms of the closed - loop system . we obtain equations for the optimal controller and outline a homotopy method which reduces the solution of the problem to the numerical integration of a differential equation initialized by the standard linear quadratic gaussian controller .
