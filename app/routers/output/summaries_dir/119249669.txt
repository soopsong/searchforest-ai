we present quantum fidelity benchmarks for continuous - variable ( cv ) quantum devices to outperform quantum channels which can transmit at most $ k$-dimensional coherences for positive integers $ k$. we determine an upper bound of an average fidelity over gaussian distributed coherent states for quantum channels whose schmidt class is $ k$. this settles fundamental fidelity steps where the known classical limit and quantum limit correspond to the two endpoints of $ k=1 $ and $ k= \infty $ , respectively . it turns out that the average fidelity is useful to verify to what extent an experimental cv gate can transmit a high dimensional coherence . the result is also extended to be applicable to general quantum operations . while the fidelity is directly associated with heterodyne measurements in quantum optics , we can also obtain similar criteria based on mean square quadrature deviations via homodyne measurements .
