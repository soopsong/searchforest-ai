we calculate analytically and numerically the axial orbital and spin torques of guided light on a two - level atom near an optical nanofiber . we show that the generation of these torques is governed by the angular momentum conservation law in the minkowski formulation . the orbital torque on the atom near the fiber has a contribution from the average recoil of spontaneously emitted photons . photon angular momentum and atomic spin angular momentum can be converted into atomic orbital angular momentum . the orbital and spin angular momenta of the guided field are not transferred separately to the orbital and spin angular momenta of the atom .
