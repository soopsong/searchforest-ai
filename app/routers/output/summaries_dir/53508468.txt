a model of memristor - based chuas oscillator is studied . the considered system has infinitely many equilibrium points , which build a line of equilibria . bifurcational mechanisms of oscillation excitation are explored for different forms of nonlinearity . hard and soft excitation scenarios have principally different nature . the hard excitation is determined by the memristor piecewise - smooth characteristic and is a result of a border - collision bifurcation . the soft excitation is caused by addition of a smooth nonlinear function and has distinctive features of the supercritical andronov - hopf bifurcation . mechanisms of instability and amplitude limitation are described for both two cases . numerical modelling and theoretical analysis are combined with experiments on an electronic analog model of the system under study . the issues concerning physical realization of the dynamics of systems with a line of equilibria are considered . the question on whether oscillations in such systems can be classified as the self - sustained oscillations is raised .
