a number of authors have suggested that nonlinear interactions can enhance resolution of phase shifts beyond the usual heisenberg scaling of 1 / n , where n is a measure of resources such as the number of subsystems of the probe state or the mean photon number of the probe state . these suggestions are based on calculations of ` local precision ' for particular nonlinear schemes . however , we show that there is no simple connection between the local precision and the average estimation error for these schemes , leading to a scaling puzzle . this puzzle is partially resolved by a careful analysis of iterative implementations of the suggested nonlinear schemes . however , it is shown that the suggested nonlinear schemes are still limited to an exponential scaling in \sqrt{n } . ( this scaling may be compared to the exponential scaling in n which is achievable if multiple passes are allowed , even for linear schemes . ) the question of whether nonlinear schemes may have a scaling advantage in the presence of loss is left open . our results are based on a new bound for average estimation error that depends on ( i ) an entropic measure of the degree to which the probe state can encode a reference phase value , called the g - asymmetry , and ( ii ) any prior information about the phase shift . this bound is asymptotically stronger than bounds based on the variance of the phase shift generator . the g - asymmetry is also shown to directly bound the average information gained per estimate . our results hold for any prior distribution of the shift parameter , and generalise to estimates of any shift generated by an operator with discrete eigenvalues .
