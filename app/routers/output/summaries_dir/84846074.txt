we investigate a general class of dissipative quantum circuit capable of computing arbitrary conjunctive normal form ( cnf ) boolean formulas . in particular , the clauses in a cnf formula define a local generator of markovian quantum dynamics which acts on a network of qubits . fixed points of this dynamical system encode the evaluation of the cnf formula . the structure of the corresponding quantum map partitions the hilbert space into sectors , according to decoherence - free subspaces ( dfss ) associated with the dissipative dynamics . these sectors then provide a natural and consistent way to classify quantum data ( i.e. quantum states ) . indeed , the attractive fixed points of the network allow one to learn the sector(s ) for which some particular quantum state is associated . we show how this structure can be used to dissipatively prepare quantum states ( e.g. entangled states ) , and outline how it may be used to generalize certain classical computational learning tasks .
