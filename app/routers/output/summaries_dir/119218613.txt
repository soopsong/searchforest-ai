we exploit and clarify the use of random matrix theory for the calculation of the entanglement entropy of free fermi gases . we apply this method to obtain analytic predictions for renyi entanglement entropies of a one - dimensional gas trapped by a harmonic potential in all the relevant scaling regimes . we confirm our findings with accurate numerical calculations obtained by means of an ingenious discretisation of the reduced correlation matrix .
