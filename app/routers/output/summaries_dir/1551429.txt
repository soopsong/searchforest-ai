a direct coupling coherent observer is constructed for a linear quantum plant which has oscillatory solutions . it is shown that a finite time moving average of the quantum observer output can provide an estimate of the quantum plant output without disturbing this plant signal . by choosing a sufficiently small averaging time and a sufficiently large observer gain , the observer tracking error can be made arbitrarily small .
