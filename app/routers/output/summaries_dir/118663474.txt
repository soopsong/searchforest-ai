we construct deformed photon added nonlinear coherent states ( dpancss ) by application of the deformed creation operator upon the nonlinear coherent states obtained as eigenstates of the deformed annihilation operator and by application of a deformed displacement operator upon the vacuum state . we evaluate some statistical properties like the mandel parameter , husimi and wigner functions for these states and analyze their differences , we give closed analytical expressions for them . we found a profound difference in the statistical properties of the dpancss obtained from the two above mentioned generalizations .
