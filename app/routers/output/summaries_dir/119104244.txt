using the"liouville space"(the space of operators ) of the massive dirac theory , we define mixed - state form factors of $ u(1)$ twist fields . we consider mixed states with density matrices diagonal in the asymptotic particle basis . this includes the thermal gibbs state as well as all generalized gibbs ensembles of the dirac theory . when the mixed state is specialized to a thermal gibbs state , using a riemann - hilbert problem and low - temperature expansion , we obtain finite - temperature form factors of $ u(1)$ twist fields . we then propose the expression for form factors of $ u(1)$ twist fields in general diagonal mixed states . we verify that these form factors satisfy a system of nonlinear functional differential equations , which is derived from the trace definition of mixed - state form factors . at last , under weak analytic conditions on the eigenvalues of the density matrix , we write down the large distance form factor expansions of two - point correlation functions of these twist fields . using the relation between the dirac and ising models , this provides the large - distance expansion of the r$\acute{\text{e}}$nyi entropy ( for integer r$\acute{\text{e}}$nyi parameter ) in the ising model in diagonal mixed states .
