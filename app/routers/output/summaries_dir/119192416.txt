we have realized a fiber - based fabry - perot cavity with co2 laser - machined mirrors . it combines very small size , high finesse f>=130000 , small waist and mode volume , and good mode matching between the fiber and cavity modes . this combination of features is a major advance for cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) , as shown in recent cqed experiments with bose - einstein condensates enabled by this cavity [ y. colombe et al . , nature 450 , 272 ( 2007 ) ] . it should also be suitable for a wide range of other applications , including coupling to solid - state emitters , gas detection at the single - particle level , fiber - coupled single - photon sources and high - resolution optical filters with large stopband .
