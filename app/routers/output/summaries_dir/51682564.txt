in this work , we present a multiple - scale perturbation technique suitable for the study of open quantum systems , which is easy to implement and in few iterative steps allows us to find excellent approximate solutions . for any time - local quantum master equation , whether markovian or non - markovian , in lindblad form or not , we give a general procedure to construct analytical approximations to the corresponding dynamical map and , consequently , to the temporal evolution of the density matrix . as a simple illustrative example of the implementation of the method , we study an atom - cavity system described by a dissipative jaynes - cummings model . performing a multiple - scale analysis we obtain approximate analytical expressions for the strong and weak coupling regimes that allow us to identify characteristic time scales in the state of the physical system .
