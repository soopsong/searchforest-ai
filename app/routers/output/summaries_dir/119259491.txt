an exact transition matrix was formulated for electromagnetic scattering by a vacuum - like sphere with magnetoelectric gyrotropy . both the total scattering and forward scattering efficiencies are lower when the magnetoelectric gyrotropy vector of the sphere is co / anti - parallel to the electric field or magnetic field of an incident plane wave than when the magnetoelectric gyrotropy vector is coparallel to the propagation vector of the incident plane wave . backscattering is absent when the propagation vector is co / anti - paralel to the magnetoelectric gyrotropy vector .
