entangled states are beneficial for quantum metrology , but difficult to prepare and maintain . to tackle this issue , we here propose a quantum metrology scheme in a cavity qed setup to achieve the heisenberg limit without preparing entangled states . in our scheme , a series of identical two - level atoms randomly pass through and interact with the cavity mode . we show that the initial atomic coherence will induce an effective driving to the cavity field , whose steady state is an incoherent superposition of orthogonal states , with the superposition probabilities being dependent on the atom - cavity coupling strength . by measuring the average photon number of the cavity in the steady state , we demonstrate that the root - mean - square of the fluctuation of the atom - cavity coupling strength is proportional to $ 1 / n_c^2 $ ( $ n_c$ is the effective atom number interacting with the photon in the cavity during its lifetime ) . it implies that we have achieved the heisenberg limit in our quantum metrology process . we also discuss the experimental feasibility of our theoretical proposal . our findings may find potential applications in quantum metrology technology .
