the exploration of quantum algorithms that possess quantum advantages is a central topic in quantum computation and quantum information processing . one potential candidate in this area is quantum generative adversarial learning ( qugal ) , which conceptually has exponential advantages over classical adversarial networks . however , the corresponding learning algorithm remains obscured . in this paper , we propose the first quantum generative adversarial learning algorithm-- the quantum multiplicative matrix weight algorithm ( qmmw)-- which enables the efficient processing of fundamental tasks . the computational complexity of qmmw is polynomially proportional to the number of training rounds and logarithmically proportional to the input size . the core concept of the proposed algorithm combines qugal with online learning . we exploit the implementation of qugal with parameterized quantum circuits , and numerical experiments for the task of entanglement test for pure state are provided to support our claims .
