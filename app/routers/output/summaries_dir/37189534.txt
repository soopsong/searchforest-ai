we study the possibility of using guided photons to generate , control , and measure the entanglement of two qubits that is mediated by a one - dimensional waveguide . we show how entanglement can be generated both with single photon and with two - photon wavepackets . the introduction of a second photon allows for a manipulation of the entanglement between the qubits , and phenomena such as sudden death and revival of entanglement appear . finally , we propose a procedure for entanglement detection via the scattering output of a single - photon over a qubit state .
