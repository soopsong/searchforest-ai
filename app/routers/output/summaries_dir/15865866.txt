it is discussed the decoherence problems in ensemble large - scale solid state nmr quantum computer based on the array of p donor atoms having nuclear spin i = 1/2 . it is considered here , as main mechanisms of decoherence for low temperature ( < 0.1 k ) , the adiabatic processes of random modulation of qubit resonance frequency determined by secular part of nuclear spin interaction with electron spin of the basic atoms , with impurity paramagnetic atoms and also with nuclear spins of impurity diamagnetic atoms . it was made estimations of allowed concentrations of magnetic impurities and of spin temperature whereby the required decoherence suppression is obtained . it is discussed the random phase error suppression in the ensemble quantum register basic states .
