the identification of phenomena able to pinpoint quantum interference is attracting large interest . indeed , a generalization of the hong - ou - mandel effect valid for any number of photons and optical modes would represent an important leap ahead both from a fundamental perspective and for practical applications , such as certification of photonic quantum devices , whose computational speedup is expected to depend critically on multiparticle interference . quantum distinctive features have been predicted for many particles injected into multimode interferometers implementing the fourier transformation in the fock space . in this work we develop a scalable approach for the implementation of quantum fast fourier transform using 3-d photonic integrated interferometers , fabricated via femtosecond laser writing technique . we observe the quantum suppression of a large number of output states with 4- and 8-mode optical circuits : the experimental results demonstrate genuine quantum interference between the injected photons , thus offering a powerful tool for diagnostic of photonic platforms .
