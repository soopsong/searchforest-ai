radiative two - photon cascades from biexcitons in semiconductor quantum dots under resonant two - photon excitation are promising candidates for the generation of photon pairs . in this work , we propose a scheme to obtain two - photon emission that allows to operate under very intense driving fields . this approach relies on the purcell enhancement of two - photon virtual transitions between states of the biexciton dressed by the laser . the richness provided by the biexcitonic level structure allows to reach a variety of regimes , from antibunched and bunched photon pairs with polarization orthogonal to the driving field , to polarization entangled two - photon emission . this evidences that the general paradigm of two - photon emission from a ladder of dressed states can find interesting , particular implementations in a variety of systems .
