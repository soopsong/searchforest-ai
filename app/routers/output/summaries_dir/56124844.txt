we investigate decoherence induced by a quantum channel in terms of minimal output entropy and of map entropy . the latter is the von neumann entropy of the jamiolkowski state of the channel . both quantities admit q - renyi versions . we prove additivity of the map entropy for all q. for the case q = 2 , we show that the depolarizing channel has the smallest map entropy among all channels with a given minimal output renyi entropy of order two . this allows us to characterize pairs of channels such that the output entropy of their tensor product acting on a maximally entangled input state is larger than the sum of the minimal output entropies of the individual channels . we conjecture that for any channel { \phi}1 acting on a finite dimensional system there exists a class of channels { \phi}2 sufficiently close to a unitary map such that additivity of minimal output entropy for { \psi}1 x { \psi}2 holds .
