in this paper we present a novel analysis of the feasibility of quantum key distribution between a leo satellite and a ground station . first of all , we study signal propagation through a turbulent atmosphere for uplinks and downlinks , discussing the contribution of beam spreading and beam wandering . then we introduce a model for the background noise of the channel during night - time and day - time , calculating the signal - to - noise ratio for different configurations . we also discuss the expected error - rate due to imperfect polarization - compensation in the channel . finally , we calculate the expected key generation rate of a secure key for different configurations ( uplink , downlink ) and for different protocols ( bb84 with and without decoy states , entanglement - based ekert91 protocol ) .
