we propose a three - mode optomechanical system to realize optical nonreciprocal transmission with unidirectional amplification , where the system consists of two coupled cavities and one mechanical resonator which interacts with only one of the cavities . additionally , the optical gain is introduced into the optomechanical cavity . it is found that for a strong optical input , the optical transmission coefficient can be greatly amplified in a particular direction and suppressed in the opposite direction . the expressions of the optimal transmission coefficient and the corresponding isolation ratio are given analytically . our results pave a way to design high - quality nonreciprocal devices based on optomechanical systems .
