entanglement can be considered as a special quantum correlation , but not the only kind . it is allowed to exist non - classical correlations even for a separable quantum system . here we propose two dissipative schemes for generating a maximally correlated state of two qubits in the absence of quantum entanglement , which was raised by [ f. galve , g. l. giorgi , and r. zambrini , { \color{blue}phys . rev . a { \bf 83 } , 012102 ( 2011 ) } ] . these protocols take full advantages of the interaction between four - level atoms and strongly lossy optical cavities . in the first scenario , we alternatively change the phases of rabi frequencies of two classical driving fields , while the second proposal introduces a strongly lossy coupled - cavity system . both schemes can realize all lindblad terms required by the dissipative dynamics , guaranteeing the maximally quantum dissonant state to be the unique steady state for a certain subspace of system . moreover , since the target state is a mixed state , the performance of our method is evaluated by the definition of super - fidelity $ g(\rho_{1},\rho_{2})$ , and the strictly numerical simulations indicate that fidelity outstripping $ 99\%$ of the quantum dissonant state is achievable with the current cavity quantum electrodynamics parameters .
