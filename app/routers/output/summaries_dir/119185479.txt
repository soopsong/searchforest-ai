entanglement entropy in even dimensional conformal field theories ( cfts ) contains well - known universal terms arising from the conformal anomaly . renyi entropies are natural generalizations of the entanglement entropy that are much less understood . above two spacetime dimensions , the universal terms in the renyi entropies are unknown for general entangling geometries . we conjecture a new structure in the dependence of the four - dimensional renyi entropies on the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the entangling surface . we provide evidence for this conjecture by direct numerical computations in the free scalar and fermion field theories . the computation involves relating the four - dimensional free massless renyi entropies across cylindrical entangling surfaces to corresponding three - dimensional massive renyi entropies across circular entangling surfaces . our numerical technique also allows us to directly probe other interesting aspects of three - dimensional renyi entropy , including the massless renormalized renyi entropy and calculable contributions to the perimeter law .
