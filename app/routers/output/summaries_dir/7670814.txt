the quantum erasure channel ( qec ) is considered . codes for the qec have to correct for erasures , i. e. , arbitrary errors at known positions . we show that four qubits are necessary and sufficient to encode one qubit and correct one erasure , in contrast to five qubits for unknown positions . moreover , a family of quantum codes for the qec , the quantum bch codes , that can be efficiently decoded is introduced .
