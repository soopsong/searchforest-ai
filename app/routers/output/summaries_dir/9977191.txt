here is discussed application of the weyl pair to construction of universal set of quantum gates for high - dimensional quantum system . an application of lie algebras ( hamiltonians ) for construction of universal gates is revisited first . it is shown next , how for quantum computation with qubits can be used two - dimensional analog of this cayley - weyl matrix algebras , i.e. clifford algebras , and discussed well known applications to product operator formalism in nmr , jordan - wigner construction in fermionic quantum computations . it is introduced universal set of quantum gates for higher dimensional system ( ` ` qudit ' ' ) , as some generalization of these models . finally it is briefly mentioned possible application of such algebraic methods to design of quantum processors ( programmable gates arrays ) and discussed generalization to quantum computation with continuous variables .
