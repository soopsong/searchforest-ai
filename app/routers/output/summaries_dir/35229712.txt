we introduce a protocol that maps finite - dimensional pure input states onto approximately gaussian states in an iterative procedure . this protocol can be used to distill highly entangled bi - partite gaussian states from a supply of weakly entangled pure gaussian states . the entire procedure requires only the use of passive optical elements and photon detectors that solely distinguish between the presence and absence of photons .
