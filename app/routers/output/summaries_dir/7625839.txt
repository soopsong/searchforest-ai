in 2008 , researchers at hp labs published a paper in { \it nature } reporting the realisation of a new basic circuit element that completes the missing link between charge and flux - linkage , which was postulated by leon chua in 1971 . the hp memristor is based on a nanometer scale tio$_2 $ thin - film , containing a doped region and an undoped region . further to proposed applications of memristors in artificial biological systems and nonvolatile ram ( nvram ) , they also enable reconfigurable nanoelectronics . moreover , memristors provide new paradigms in application specific integrated circuits ( asics ) and field programmable gate arrays ( fpgas ) . a significant reduction in area with an unprecedented memory capacity and device density are the potential advantages of memristors for integrated circuits ( ics ) . this work reviews the memristor and provides mathematical and spice models for memristors . insight into the memristor device is given via recalling the quasi - static expansion of maxwell 's equations . we also review chua 's arguments based on electromagnetic theory .
