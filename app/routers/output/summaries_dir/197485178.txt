manipulation of qudits in optical tables is a difficult and nonscalable task . the use of integrated optical circuits opens new possibilities for the generation , manipulation , and characterization of high dimensional states besides the ease of transmission of these states through an optical fiber . in this work we propose photonic circuits to perform minimum quantum state tomography of path qudits and show how to determine all the constituents parameters of these circuits ( beam splitters and phase shifters ) . our strategies were based on the symmetries of the involved povms ( positive operator - valued measures ) suggested for minimum tomography and allowed us to obtain interferometers smaller than those obtained by other already known methods . the calculations of the transmittances and reflectivities of the beam splitters were made using the definition of probability operators in extended hilbert spaces and the application of naimark 's theorem . the employment of equidistant states for the definition of the povm elements allowed us to develop a recipe applicable to the tomography of qudits of any dimension , generalizing our scheme .
