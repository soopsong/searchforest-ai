experimentalists seeking to improve the coherent lifetimes of quantum bits have generally focused on mitigating decoherence mechanisms through , for example , improvements to qubit designs and materials , and system isolation from environmental perturbations . in the case of the phase degree of freedom in a quantum superposition , however , the coherence that must be preserved is not solely internal to the qubit , but rather necessarily includes that of the qubit relative to the"master clock"(e.g . a local oscillator ) that governs its control system . in this manuscript we articulate the impact of instabilities in the master clock on qubit phase coherence , and provide tools to calculate the contributions to qubit error arising from these processes . we first connect standard oscillator phase - noise metrics to their corresponding qubit dephasing spectral densities . we then use representative lab - grade and performance - grade oscillator specifications to calculate operational fidelity bounds on trapped - ion and superconducting qubits with relatively slow and fast operation times . we discuss the relevance of these bounds for quantum error correction in contemporary experiments and future large - scale quantum information systems , and discuss potential means to improve master clock stability .
