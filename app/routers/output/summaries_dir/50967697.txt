the atmospheric turbulence is the main factor that influences quantum properties of propagating optical signals and may sufficiently degrade the performance of quantum communication protocols . the probability distribution of transmittance ( pdt ) for free - space channels is the main characteristics of the atmospheric links . applying the law of total probability , we derive the pdt by separating the contributions from turbulence - induced beam wandering and beam - spot distortions . as a result , the obtained pdt varies from log - negative weibull to truncated log - normal distributions depending on the channel characteristics . moreover , we show that the method allows one to consistently describe beam tracking , a procedure which is typically used in practical long - distance free - space quantum communication . we analyze the security of decoy - state quantum key exchange through the turbulent atmosphere and show that beam tracking does not always improves quantum communication .
