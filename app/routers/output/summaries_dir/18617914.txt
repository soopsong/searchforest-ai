entangled photon - pair sources based on spontaneous parametric processes are widely used in photonic quantum information experiments . in this paper , we clarify the relationship between average photon - pair number and the visibility of two - photon interference ( tpi ) using those entanglement sources . we consider sources that generate distinguishable and indistinguishable entangled photon pairs , assuming coincidence measurements that use threshold detectors . we present formulas for the tpi visibility of a polarization entanglement that take account of all the high - order multi - pair emission events . moreover , we show that the formulas can be approximated with simple functions of the average pair number when the photon collection efficiency is small . as a result , we reveal that an indistinguishable entangled pair provides better visibility than a distinguishable one .
