network coding is often explained by using a small network model called butterfly . in this network , there are two flow paths , s_1 to t_1 and s_2 to t_2 , which share a single bottleneck channel of capacity one . so , if we consider conventional flow ( of liquid , for instance ) , then the total amount of flow must be at most one in total , say 1/2 for each path . however , if we consider information flow , then we can send two bits ( one for each path ) at the same time by exploiting two side links , which are of no use for the liquid - type flow , and encoding / decoding operations at each node . this is known as network coding and has been quite popular since its introduction by ahlswede , cai , li and yeung in 2000 . in qip 2006 , hayashi et al showed that quantum network coding is possible for butterfly , namely we can send two qubits simultaneously with keeping their fidelity strictly greater than 1/2 . in this paper , we show that the result can be extended to a large class of general graphs by using a completely different approach . the underlying technique is a new cloning method called entanglement - free cloning which does not produce any entanglement at all . this seems interesting on its own and to show its possibility is an even more important purpose of this paper . combining this new cloning with approximation of general quantum states by a small number of fixed ones , we can design a quantum network coding protocol which ` ` simulates ' ' its classical counterpart for the same graph .
