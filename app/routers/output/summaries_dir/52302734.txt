this paper combines probabilistic and algebraic techniques for computing quantum expectations of operator exponentials ( and their products ) of quadratic forms of quantum variables in gaussian states . such quadratic - exponential functionals ( qefs ) resemble quantum statistical mechanical partition functions with quadratic hamiltonians and are also used as performance criteria in quantum risk - sensitive filtering and control problems for linear quantum stochastic systems . we employ a lie - algebraic correspondence between complex symplectic matrices and quadratic - exponential functions of system variables of a quantum harmonic oscillator . the complex symplectic factorizations are used together with a parametric randomization of the quasi - characteristic or moment - generating functions according to an auxiliary classical gaussian distribution . this reduces the qef to an exponential moment of a quadratic form of classical gaussian random variables with a complex symmetric matrix and is applicable to recursive computation of such moments .
