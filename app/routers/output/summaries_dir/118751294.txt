we study two - dimensional quantum gaussian packets with a fixed value of mean angular momentum . this value is the sum of two independent parts : the ` external ' momentum related to the motion of the packet center and the ` internal ' momentum due to quantum fluctuations . the packets minimizing the mean energy of an isotropic oscillator with the fixed mean angular momentum are found . they exist for ` co - rotating ' external and internal motions , and they have nonzero correlation coefficients between coordinates and momenta , together with some ( moderate ) amount of quadrature squeezing . variances of angular momentum and energy are calculated , too . differences in the behavior of ` co - rotating ' and ` anti - rotating ' packets are shown . the time evolution of rotating gaussian packets is analyzed , including the cases of a charge in a homogeneous magnetic field and a free particle . in the latter case , the effect of initial shrinking of packets with big enough coordinate - momentum correlation coefficients ( followed by the well known expansion ) is discovered . this happens due to a competition of ` focusing ' and ` de - focusing ' in the orthogonal directions .
