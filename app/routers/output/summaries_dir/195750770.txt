level repulsion is the typical feature of coherent coupling between light and matter . in contrast , level attraction induced by the dissipative coupling converges the rabi - splitting and exhibits potentials in topological information processing . for quantifying coherence - dissipation competition and thereby flexibly manipulating level attraction , it is highly desirable to uncover the quantum microscopic origin of dissipative coupling . here , by coupling magnon to a cavity supporting both standing and travelling waves , we identify the travelling - wave state to be responsible for magnon - photon dissipative coupling . by characterizing radiative broadening of magnon linewidth , we quantify the coherent and dissipative coupling strengths and their competition . the effective magnon - photon coupling strength , as a net result of competition , is analytically presented in theory to show good agreement with measurements . we extend the control dimension of level attraction by tuning field torque on magnetization or global cavity geometry . our finding opens new routines to engineer coupled magnon - photon system .
