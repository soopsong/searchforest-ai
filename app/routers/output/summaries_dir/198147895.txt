unlike in the case of distinguishable particles , the concept of entanglement-- not to mention , nonlocality-- remains debated in case of indistinguishable particles . here , we show that certain existing all - versus - nothing type of proofs of contextuality or nonlocality for distinguishable particles , based on a logical contradiction , may be carried over to indistinguishable particles .
