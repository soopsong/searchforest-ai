combination of the electromagnetically - induced - transparency ( eit ) effect and rydberg - state atoms has attracted great attention recently due to its potential application in the photon - photon interaction or qubit operation . in this work , we studied the rydberg - eit spectra with room - temperature $ ^{87}$rb atoms . spectroscopic data under various experimental parameters all showed that the contrast of eit transparency as a function of the probe intensity is initially enhanced , reaches a maximum value and then decays gradually . the contrast of spectral profile at the optimum probe field intensity is enhanced by $ 2 - 4 $ times as compared with that at weak intensity . moreover , the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum can potentially be improved by 1 or 2 order of magnitude . we provided a theoretical model to explain this behavior and clarified its underlying mechanism . our work overcomes the obstacle of weak signal in the rydberg - eit spectrum caused by an apparent relaxation rate of the rydberg polariton and weak coupling transition strength , and provides the useful knowledge for the rydberg - eit study .
