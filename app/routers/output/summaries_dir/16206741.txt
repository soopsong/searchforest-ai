we consider the weak coupling limit for a quantum system consisting of a small subsystem and reservoirs . it is known rigorously since [ dav74 ] that the heisenberg evolution restricted to the small system converges in an appropriate sense to a markovian semigroup . in the nineties , accardi , frigerio and lu [ afl90 ] initiated an investigation of the convergence of the unreduced unitary evolution to a singular unitary evolution generated by a quantum langevin equation . we present a version of this convergence which is both simpler and stronger than the formulations which we know . our main result says that in an appropriately understood weak coupling limit the interaction of the small system with environment can be expressed in terms of the so - called quantum white noise .
