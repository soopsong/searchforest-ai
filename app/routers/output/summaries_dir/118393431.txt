diverse models of engines energised by quantum - coherent , hence non - thermal , baths allow the engine efficiency to transgress the standard thermodynamic carnot bound . these transgressions call for an elucidation of the underlying mechanisms . here we show that non - thermal baths may impart not only heat , but also mechanical work to a machine . the carnot bound is inapplicable to such a hybrid machine . intriguingly , it may exhibit dual action , concurrently as engine and refrigerator , with up to 100 % efficiency . we conclude that even though a machine powered by a quantum bath may exhibit an unconventional performance , it still abides by the traditional principles of thermodynamics .
