we develop a self - consistent finite element method to study spontaneous emission at nanoscale proximity of plasmonic waveguides . in the model , it is assumed that only one guided mode is dominatingly excited by the quantum emitter . with such one dominating mode assumption , the cross section of the plasmonic waveguide can be arbitrary . we apply our numerical method to calculate the coupling of a quantum emitter to a cylindrical nanowire and a rectangular waveguide , and compare the cylindrical nanowire to previous work valid in quasistatic approximation . the fraction of the energy coupled to the plasmonic mode can be calculated exactly , which can be used to determine the single optical plasmon generation efficiency for a quantum emitter . for a gold nanowire we observe agreement with the quasistatic approximation for radii below 20 nm , but for larger radii the total decay rate is up to 10 times larger . for the rectangular waveguide we estimate an optimized value for the spontaneous emission factor \beta of up to 80 % .
