as a fundamental phenomenon in nature , randomness has a wide range of applications in the fields of science and engineering . among different types of random number generators ( rng ) , quantum random number generator ( qrng ) is a kind of promising rng as it can provide provable true random numbers based on the inherent randomness of fundamental quantum processes . nevertheless , the randomness from a qrng can be diminished ( or even destroyed ) if the devices ( especially the entropy source devices ) are not perfect or ill - characterized . to eliminate the practical security loopholes from the source , source - independent qrngs , which allow the source to have arbitrary and unknown dimensions , have been introduced and become one of the most important semi - device - independent qrngs . herein a method that enables ultra - fast unpredictable quantum random number generation from quadrature fluctuations of quantum optical field without any assumptions on the input states is proposed . particularly , to estimate a lower bound on the extractable randomness that is independent from side information held by an eavesdropper , a new security analysis framework is established based on the extremality of gaussian states , which can be easily extended to design and analyze new semi - device - independent continuous variable qrng protocols . moreover , the practical imperfections of the qrng including the effects of excess noise , finite sampling range , finite resolution and asymmetric conjugate quadratures are taken into account and quantitatively analyzed . finally , the proposed method is experimentally demonstrated to obtain high secure random number generation rates of 15.07 gbits / s in off - line configuration and can potentially achieve 6 gbits / s by real - time post - processing .
