we have studied entanglement entropy and husimi $ q$ distribution as a tool to explore chaos in the quantum two - photon dicke model . with the increase of the energy of system , the linear entanglement entropy of coherent state prepared in the classical chaotic and regular regions become more distinguishable , and the correspondence relationship between the distribution of time - averaged entanglement entropy and the classical poincar\'{e } section has been improved obviously . moreover , husimi $ q$ distribution for the initial states corresponded to the points in the chaotic region in the higher energy system disperses more quickly than that in the lower energy system . our result imply that higher system energy has contributed to distinguish the chaotic and regular behavior in the quantum two - photon dicke model .
