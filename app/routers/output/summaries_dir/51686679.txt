lattice surgery is a method to perform quantum computation fault - tolerantly by using operations on boundary qubits between different patches of the planar code . this technique allows for universal planar - code computation without eliminating the intrinsic two - dimensional nearest - neighbor properties of the surface code that eases physical hardware implementations . lattice - surgery approaches to algorithmic compilation and optimization have been demonstrated to be more resource efficient for resource - intensive components of a fault - tolerant algorithm , and consequently may be preferable over braid - based logic . lattice surgery can be extended to the raussendorf lattice , providing a measurement - based approach to the surface code . in this paper we describe how lattice surgery can be performed on the raussendorf lattice and therefore give a viable alternative to computation using braiding in measurement based implementations of topological codes .
