nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) was successfully employed to test several protocols and ideas in quantum information science . in most of these implementations the existence of entanglement was ruled out . this fact introduced concerns and questions about the quantum nature of such bench tests . in this article we address some issues related to the non - classical aspects of nmr systems . we discuss some experiments where the quantum aspects of this system are supported by quantum correlations of separable states . such quantumness , beyond the entanglement - separability paradigm , is revealed via a departure between the quantum and the classical versions of information theory . in this scenario , the concept of quantum discord seems to play an important role . we also present an experimental implementation of an analogous of the single - photon mach - zehnder interferometer employing two nuclear spins to encode the interferometric paths . this experiment illustrate how non - classical correlations of separable states may be used to simulate quantum dynamics . the results obtained are completely equivalent to the optical scenario , where entanglement ( between two field modes ) may be present .
