a unified theory is given of dynamically modified decay and decoherence of field - driven multilevel multipartite entangled states that are weakly coupled to zero - temperature baths or undergo random phase fluctuations . the theory allows for arbitrary local differences in their coupling to the environment . due to such differences , the optimal driving - field modulation to ensure maximal fidelity is found to substantially differ from conventional ` ` bang - bang ' ' or $ \pi$-phase flips of the single - qubit evolution .
