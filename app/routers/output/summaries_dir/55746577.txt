the long - standing conjectures of the optimality of gaussian inputs for gaussian channel and gaussian additivity are solved for a broad class of covariant or contravariant bosonic gaussian channels ( which includes in particular thermal , additive classical noise , and amplifier channels ) restricting to the class of states with finite second moments . we show that the vacuum is the input state which minimizes the entropy at the output of such channels . this allows us to show also that the classical capacity of these channels ( under the input energy constraint ) is additive and is achieved by gaussian encodings .
