we present the reduction and manipulation of quantum radiation pressure noise ( qrpn ) in an optomechanical cavity with the injection of squeezed light . the optomechanical system consists of a high - reflectivity single - crystal microresonator which serves as one mirror of a fabry - perot cavity . the experiment is performed at room temperature and is qrpn dominated between 10 khz and 50 khz , frequencies relevant to gravitational wave observatories . we observed a reduction of 1.2 db in the measurement noise floor with the injection of amplitude squeezed light generated from a below - threshold degenerate optical parametric oscillator . this experiment is a crucial step in realizing the reduction of qrpn for future interferometric gravitational wave detectors and improving their sensitivity .
