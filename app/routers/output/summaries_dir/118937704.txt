we consider quantum error - correction codes for multimode bosonic systems , such as optical fields , that are affected by amplitude damping . such a process is a generalization of an erasure channel . we demonstrate that the most accessible method of transforming optical systems with the help of passive linear networks has limited usefulness in preparing and manipulating such codes . these limitations stem directly from the recoverability condition for one - photon loss . we introduce a three - photon code protecting against the first order of amplitude damping , i.e. a single photon loss , and discuss its preparation using linear optics with single - photon sources and conditional detection . quantum state and process tomography in the code subspace can be implemented using passive linear optics and photon counting . an experimental proof - of - principle demonstration of elements of the proposed quantum error correction scheme for a one - photon erasure lies well within present technological capabilites .
