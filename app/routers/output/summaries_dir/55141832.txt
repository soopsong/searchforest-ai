we provide an explicit construction for gazeau - klauder coherent states related to non - hermitian hamiltonians with discrete bounded below and nondegenerate eigenspectrum . the underlying spacetime structure is taken to be of a noncommutative type with associated uncertainty relations implying minimal lengths . the uncertainty relations for the constructed states are shown to be saturated in a hermitian as well as a non - hermitian setting for a perturbed harmonic oscillator . the computed value of the mandel parameter dictates that the coherent wavepackets are assembled according to sub - poissonian statistics . fractional revival times , indicating the superposition of classical - like sub - wave packets are clearly identified .
