the concept of wave - particle duality , which is a key element of quantum theory , has been remarkably found to manifest itself in several experimental realizations as in the famous double - slit experiment . in this specific case , a single particle seems to travel through two separated slits simultaneously . nevertheless , it is never possible to measure it in both slits , which naturally appears as a manifestation of the collapse postulate . in this respect , one could as well ask if it is possible to"perceive"the presence of the particle at the two slits simultaneously , once its collapse could be avoided . in this article , we use the recently proposed entanglement mediation protocol to provide a positive answer to this question . it is shown that a photon which behaves like a wave , i.e. , which seems to be present in two distant locations at the same time , can modify two existing physical realities in these locations . calculations of the"weak trace"left by such photon also enforce the validity of the present argumentation .
