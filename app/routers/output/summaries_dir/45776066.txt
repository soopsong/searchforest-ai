based on the explicit knowledge of a hamiltonian of mean force , the classical statistical mechanics and equilibrium thermodynamics of open systems in contact with a thermal environment at arbitrary interaction strength can be formulated . even though the hamiltonian of mean force uniquely determines the equilibrium phase space probability density of a strongly coupled open system the knowledge of this probability density alone is insufficient to determine the hamiltonian of mean force , needed in constructing the underlying statistical mechanics and thermodynamics . we demonstrate that under the assumption that the hamiltonian of mean force is known , an extension of thermodynamic structures from the level of averaged quantities to fluctuating objects ( i.e. a stochastic thermodynamics ) is possible . however , such a construction undesirably involves also a vast ambiguity . this situation is rooted in the eminent lack of a physical guiding principle allowing to distinguish a physically meaningful theory out of a multitude of other equally conceivable ones .
