a key obstacle to the experimental realization of many photonic quantum - enhanced technologies is the lack of low - loss sources of single photons in pure quantum states . we demonstrate a promising solution : generation of heralded single photons in a silica photonic chip by spontaneous four - wave mixing . a heralding efficiency of 40 % , corresponding to a preparation efficiency of 80 % accounting for detector performance , is achieved due to efficient coupling of the low - loss source to optical fibers . a single photon purity of 0.86 is measured from the source number statistics without filtering , and confirmed by direct measurement of the joint spectral intensity . we calculate that similar high - heralded - purity output can be obtained from visible to telecom spectral regions using this approach . on - chip silica sources can have immediate application in a wide range of single - photon quantum optics applications which employ silica photonics .
