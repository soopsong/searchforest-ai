it is well known that the violation of bell 's inequality in the form given by clauser , horne , shimony , and holt ( chsh ) in two - qubit systems requires entanglement , but not vice versa , i.e. , there are entangled states which do not violate the chsh inequality . here we compare some standard entanglement measures with violations of the chsh inequality ( as given by the horodecki measure ) for two - qubit states generated by monte carlo simulations . we describe states that have extremal entanglement according to the negativity , concurrence , and relative entropy of entanglement for a given value of the chsh violation . we explicitly find these extremal states by applying the generalized method of lagrange multipliers based on the karush - kuhn - tucker conditions . the found minimal and maximal states define the range of entanglement accessible for any two - qubit states that violate the chsh inequality by the same amount . we also find extremal states for the concurrence versus negativity by considering only such states which do not violate the chsh inequality . furthermore , we describe an experimentally efficient linear - optical method to determine the highest horodecki degree of the chsh violation for arbitrary mixed states of two polarization qubits . by assuming to have access simultaneously to two copies of the states , our method requires only six discrete measurement settings instead of nine settings , which are usually considered .
