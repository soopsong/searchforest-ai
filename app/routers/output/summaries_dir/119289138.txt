we address the problem of learning an unknown unitary transformation from a finite number of examples . the problem consists in finding the learning machine that optimally emulates the examples , thus reproducing the unknown unitary maximum fidelity . learning a unitary is equivalent to storing it in the state of a quantum memory ( the memory of the learning machine ) , and subsequently retrieving it . we prove that , whenever the unknown unitary is drawn from a group , the optimal strategy consists in a parallel call of the available uses followed by a"measure - and - rotate"retrieving . differing from the case of quantum cloning , where the incoherent"measure - and - prepare"strategies are typically suboptimal , in the case of learning the"measure - and - rotate"strategy is optimal even when the learning machine is asked to reproduce a single copy of the unknown unitary . we finally address the problem of the optimal inversion of an unknown unitary evolution , showing also in this case the optimality of the"measure - and - rotate"strategies and applying our result to the optimal approximate realignment of reference frames for quantum communication .
