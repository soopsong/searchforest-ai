we consider whether trainable quantum unitaries can be used to discover quantum speed - ups for classical problems . using methods recently developed for training quantum neural nets , we consider simon 's problem , for which there is a known quantum algorithm which performs exponentially faster in the number of bits , relative to the best known classical algorithm . we give the problem to a randomly chosen but trainable unitary circuit , and find that the training recovers simon 's algorithm as hoped .
