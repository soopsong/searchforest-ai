tests of local realism and their applications aim for very high confidence in their results even in the presence of potentially adversarial effects . for this purpose , one can measure a quantity that reflects the amount of violation of local realism and determine a bound on the probability , according to local realism , of obtaining a violation at least that observed . in general , it is difficult to obtain sufficiently robust and small bounds . here we describe an efficient protocol for computing such bounds from any set of bell inequalities for any number of parties , measurement settings , or outcomes . the protocol can be applied to tests of other properties ( such as entanglement or dimensionality ) that are witnessed by linear inequalities .
