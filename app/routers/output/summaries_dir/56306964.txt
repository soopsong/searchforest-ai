photon antibunching is a quantum phenomenon typically observed in strongly nonlinear systems where photon blockade suppresses the probability for detecting two photons at the same time . antibunching has also been reported with gaussian states , where optimized amplitude squeezing yields classically forbidden values of the intensity correlation , $ g^{(2)}(0)<1$. as a consequence , observing antibunching is not necessarily a signature of photon - photon interactions . to clarify the significance of the intensity correlations , we derive a sufficient condition for deducing if a field is non - gaussian based on a $ g^{(2)}(0)$ measurement . we then show that the gaussian antibunching obtained with a degenerate parametric amplifier is close to the ideal case reached using dissipative squeezing protocols . we finally shed light on the so - called unconventional photon blockade effect predicted in a driven two - cavity setup with surprisingly weak kerr nonlinearities , stressing that it is a particular realization of optimized gaussian amplitude squeezing .
