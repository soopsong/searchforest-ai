nature of quantum walk in presence of multiple marked state has been studied by nahimovs and rivosh \cite{10.1007/978 - 3 - 662 - 49192 - 8_31 } . they have shown that if the marked states are arranged in a $ \sqrt{k } \times \sqrt{k}$ cluster in a $ \sqrt{n } \times \sqrt{n}$ grid , then to find a single marked state among the multiple ones , quantum walk requires $ \omega(\sqrt{n } - \sqrt{k})$ time . in this paper , we show that using lackadaisical quantum walk with the weight of the self - loop as $ \frac{4}{n(k + \lfloor{\frac{\sqrt{{k}}}{2}}\rfloor)}$ , where $ k$ is odd , the probability of finding a marked state increases by $ \sim 0.2$. furthermore , we show that instead of applying the quantum walk $ \mathcal{o}(k)$ times to find all the marked states , classical search in the vicinity of the marked state found after the first implementation of the quantum walk can find all the marked states in $ \mathcal{o}(\sqrt{k})$ time on average .
