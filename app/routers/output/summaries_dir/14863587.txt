we propose a spectrometric method to reconstruct the motional states of mechanical modes in optomechanics . this is achieved by detecting the single - photon emission and scattering spectra of the optomechanical cavity . owing to an optomechanical coupling , the \emph{a priori } phonon - state distributions contribute to the spectral magnitude , and hence we can infer information on the phonon states from the measured spectral data . when the single - photon optomechanical - coupling strength is moderately larger than the mechanical frequency , then our method works well for a wide range of cavity - field decay rates , irrespective of whether or not the system is in the resolved - sideband regime .
