motivated by the recent development of the feshbach technique , we studied the ground and low - lying excited states of attractive bose - einstein condensates on a one - dimensional ring as a function of the strength of interactions . the gross - pitaevskii mean - field theory predicts a quantum phase transition between a uniform condensate and a bright soliton , and a gapless singular cusp in the bogoliubov excitation spectrum at the critical point . however , the exact diagonalization reveals the presence of an energy gap at the critical point , where the singularity is smeared by quantum fluctuations .
