non - equilibrium thermodynamics and quantum information theory are interrelated research fields witnessing an increasing interest , both theoretical and experimental . this is manly due to the broadness of these theories , which found applications in many different fields of science , ranging from biology to the foundations of physics . here , by employing the orbital angular momentum of light , we propose a new platform for studying non - equilibrium properties of high dimensional quantum systems . specifically , we use laguerre - gaussian beams to emulate the energy eigenstates of a two - dimension quantum harmonic oscillator having angular momentum . these light beams are subjected to a process realized by a spatial light modulator and the corresponding work distribution is experimentally reconstructed employing a two - point measurement scheme . the jarzynski fluctuation relation is then verified . we also demonstrate the operation of the system as a maxwell 's demon .
