we demonstrate the distribution of polarization - entangled photons for the purpose of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) along active telecom fibers . entangled photon pairs of 810 nm wavelength generated by a sagnac interferometer source were coupled into standard telecom single mode fibers . the fibers were either dark or carrying a standardized 1550 nm ethernet signals ( 1000base - zx ) with a nominal speed of 1 gbps from regular media converter devices , without any requirements on the optical power or spectrum transmitted . our system demonstrates a qkd network covering 6 km in distance with a central service provider for classical and quantum data .
