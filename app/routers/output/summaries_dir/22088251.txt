we derive analytical results for various quantities related to the excited - state quantum phase transitions in a class of dicke superradiance models in the semiclassical limit . based on a calculation of a partition sum restricted to dicke states , we discuss the singular behavior of the derivative of the density of states and find observables like the mean ( atomic ) inversion and the boson ( photon ) number and its fluctuations at arbitrary energies . criticality depends on energy and a parameter that quantifies the relative weight of rotating versus counter - rotating terms , and we find a close analogy to the logarithmic and jump - type non - analyticities known from the lipkin - meshkov - glick model .
