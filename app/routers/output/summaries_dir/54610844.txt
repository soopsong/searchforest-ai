we investigate the rate of superradiant emission for a number of artificial atoms ( qubits ) embedded in a one - dimensional open waveguide . more specifically , we study the 1d ( n+1)- qubit chain where n qubits are identical in respect to their excitation frequency $ \omega$ but have different rates of spontaneous emission $ \gamma_n$ , and a single impurity qubit which is different from n qubits by its excitation frequency $ \omega_p$ and rate of spontaneous emission $ \gamma_p$. this system is shown to have two hybridized collective states which accumulates the widths of all qubits . the energy spectrum of these states and corresponding probabilities are investigated as the function of the frequency detuning between the impurity and other qubits in a chain . it is shown that the inclusion of impurity qubit alter the resonance widths of the system only in a narrow range of the frequency detuning between qubits and impurity , where the resonance widths experience a significant repulsion . the photon transmission through disordered n- qubit chain with impurity qubit is also considered . it is shown that a single photon transport through this system is described by a simple expression which predicts for specific photon frequency the existence of a complete transmission peak and transparency window between frequencies $ \omega$ and $ \omega_p$.
