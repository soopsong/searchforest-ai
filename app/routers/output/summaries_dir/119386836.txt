the collective excitation of ordered spins , known as spin waves or magnons , can in principle radiate by emitting travelling photons to an open system when decaying to the ground state . however , in contrast to the electric dipoles , magnetic dipoles contributed by magnons are more isolated from electromagnetic environment with negligible radiation in the vacuum , limiting their application in coherent communication by photons . recently , strong interaction between cavity standing - wave photons and magnons has been reported , indicating the possible manipulation of magnon radiation via tailoring photon states . here , with loading an yttrium iron garnet sphere in a one - dimensional circular waveguide cavity in the presence of both travelling and standing photon modes , we demonstrate an efficient photon emissions from magnon and a significant magnon radiative damping with radiation rate found to be proportional to the local density of states ( ldos ) of photon . by modulating the ldos including its magnitude and/or polarization , we can flexibly tune the photon emission and magnon radiative damping on demand . our findings provide a general way in manipulating photon emission from magnon radiation for harnessing energy and angular momentum generation , transfer and storage modulated by magnon in the cavity and waveguide electrodynamics .
