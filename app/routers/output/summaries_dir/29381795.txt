we calculate the optical potentials , i.e. the light shifts , of the ground and excited states of atomic cesium in a two - color evanescent field around a subwavelength - diameter fiber . we show that the light shifts of the $ 6s_{1/2}\leftrightarrow 6p_{3/2}$ transitions can be minimized by tuning one trapping light to around 934.5 nm in wavelength ( central red - detuned magic wavelength ) and the other light to around 685.5 nm in wavelength ( central blue - detuned magic wavelength ) . the simultaneous use of the red- and blue - detuned magic wavelengths allows state - insensitive two - color trapping and guiding of cesium atoms along the thin fiber . our results can be used to efficiently load a two - color dipole trap by cesium atoms from a magneto - optical trap and to perform continuous observations .
