in the present article we investigate the efficacy of dzyaloshisnhkii - moriya ( dm ) interaction to convert the bound entangled states into free entangled states . here we consider the tripartite hybrid system as a pair of non interacting two qutrits initially prepared in bound entangled states and one auxiliary qubit . the auxiliary qubit interacts with any one of the qutrit of the pair through dm interaction . it has been found that the dm interaction free the bound entangled states as time advances . in the present work we consider two types of bound entangled states investigated by horodecki . further we find that the frequency of free entanglement conversion is same in both the states . we also investigate the phenomenon of entanglement and distillability sudden death and their possibilities . here the realignment criteria and negativity have been used for detection and quantification of entanglement .
