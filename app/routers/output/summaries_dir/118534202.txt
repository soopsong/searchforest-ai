one of the deepest and most long - standing mysteries in physics has been the huge discrepancy between the observed vacuum density and our expectations from theories of high energy physics , which has been dubbed the old cosmological constant problem . one proposal to address this puzzle at the semi - classical level is to decouple quantum vacuum from space - time geometry via a modification of gravity that includes an incompressible fluid , known as gravitational aether . in this paper , we discuss classical predictions of this theory along with its compatibility with cosmological and experimental tests of gravity . we argue that deviations from general relativity ( gr ) in this theory are sourced by pressure or vorticity . in particular , the theory predicts that the gravitational constant for radiation is 33 % larger than that of non - relativistic matter , which is preferred by ( most ) cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , lyman - alpha forest , and lithium-7 primordial abundance observations , while being consistent with other cosmological tests at ~2-sigma level . it is further shown that all parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameters have the standard gr values aside from the anomalous coupling to pressure , which has not been directly measured . a more subtle prediction of this model ( assuming irrotational aether ) is that the ( intrinsic ) gravitomagnetic effect is 33 % larger than gr prediction . this is consistent with current limits from lageos and gravity probe b at ~2-sigma level .
