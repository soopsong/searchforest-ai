in quantum field theory , bare particles are dressed by a cloud of virtual particles to form physical particles . the virtual particles affect properties such as the mass and charge of the physical particles , and it is only these modified properties that can be measured in experiments , not the properties of the bare particles . the influence of virtual particles is prominent in the ultrastrong - coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , which has recently been realized in several condensed - matter systems . in some of these systems , the effective interaction between atom - like transitions and the cavity photons can be switched on or off by external control pulses . this offers unprecedented possibilities for exploring quantum vacuum fluctuations and the relation between physical and bare particles . here we show that , by applying external electromagnetic pulses of suitable amplitude and frequency , each virtual photon dressing a physical excitation in cavity - qed systems can be converted into a physical observable photon , and back again . in this way , the hidden relationship between the bare and the physical excitations becomes experimentally testable . the conversion between virtual and physical photons can be clearly pictured using feynman diagrams with cut loops .
