we consider the design of self - testers for quantum gates . a self - tester for the gates f_1, ... ,f_m is a classical procedure that , given any gates g_1, ... ,g_m , decides with high probability if each g_i is close to f_i . this decision has to rely only on measuring in the computational basis the effect of iterating the gates on the classical states . it turns out that instead of individual gates , we can only design procedures for families of gates . to achieve our goal we borrow some elegant ideas of the theory of program testing : we characterize the gate families by specific properties , we develop a theory of robustness for them , and show that they lead to self - testers . in particular we prove that the universal and fault - tolerant set of gates consisting of a hadamard gate , a c - not gate , and a phase rotation gate of angle pi/4 is self - testable .
