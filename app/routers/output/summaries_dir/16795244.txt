we give a new ` ` nested adds ' ' circuit for implementing shor 's algorithm in linear width and quadratic depth on a nearest - neighbor machine . our circuit combines draper 's transform adder with approximation ideas of zalka . the transform adder requires small controlled rotations . we also give another version , with slightly larger depth , using only reversible classical gates . we do not know which version will ultimately be cheaper to implement .
