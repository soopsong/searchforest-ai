we refine epstein 's method to prove joint concavity / convexity of matrix trace functions of lieb type $ \mathrm{tr}\,f(\phi(a^p)^{1/2}\psi(b^q)\phi(a^p)^{1/2})$ and symmetric ( anti- ) norm functions of the form $ \|f(\phi(a^p)\,\sigma\,\psi(b^q))\|$ , where $ \phi$ and $ \psi$ are positive linear maps , $ \sigma$ is an operator mean , and $ f(x^\gamma)$ with a certain power $ \gamma$ is an operator monotone function on $ ( 0,\infty)$. moreover , the variational method of carlen , frank and lieb is extended to general non - decreasing convex / concave functions on $ ( 0,\infty)$ so that we prove joint concavity / convexity of more trace functions of lieb type .
