mutual unbiasedness of the eigenstates of phase - space operators - such as position and momentum , or their standard coarse grained versions - exists only in the limiting case of infinite squeezing . in [ phys . rev . lett . 120 , 040403 ( 2018 ) ] it was shown that mutual unbiasedness can be recovered for periodic coarse grainings of these two operators . here we investigate mutual unbiasedness of coarse - grained measurements for more than two phase - space variables . we show that mutual unbiasedness can be recovered between periodic coarse graining of any two non - parallel phase - space operators . we illustrate these results through optics experiments using the fractional fourier transform to prepare and measure mutually unbiased phase - space variables . the differences between two and three mutually unbiased measurements is discussed . our results contribute to bridging the gap between continuous and discrete quantum mechanics and could be useful in quantum information protocols .
