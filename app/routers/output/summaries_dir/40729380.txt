squeezed states of light constitute an important nonclassical resource in the field of high - precision measurements , e.g. gravitational wave detection , as well as in the field of quantum information , e.g. for teleportation , quantum cryptography , and distribution of entanglement in quantum computation networks . strong squeezing in combination with high purity , high bandwidth and high spatial mode quality is desirable in order to achieve significantly improved performances contrasting any classical protocols . here we report on the observation of the strongest squeezing to date of 11.5 db , together with unprecedented high state purity corresponding to a vacuum contribution of less than 5 % , and a squeezing bandwidth of about 170 mhz . the analysis of our squeezed states reveals a significant production of higher - order pairs of quantum - correlated photons , and the existence of strong photon number oscillations .
