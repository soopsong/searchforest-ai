we report heating rate measurements in a microfabricated gold - on - sapphire surface electrode ion trap with trapping height of approximately 240 micron . using the doppler recooling method , we characterize the trap heating rates over an extended region of the trap . the noise spectral density of the trap falls in the range of noise spectra reported in ion traps at room temperature . we find that during the first months of operation the heating rates increase by approximately one order of magnitude . the increase in heating rates is largest in the ion loading region of the trap , providing a strong hint that surface contamination plays a major role for excessive heating rates . we discuss data found in the literature and possible relation of anomalous heating to sources of noise and dissipation in other systems , namely impurity atoms adsorbed on metal surfaces and amorphous dielectrics .
