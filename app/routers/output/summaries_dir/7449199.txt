we describe a procedure by which a long ( $ \gtrsim 1\,\mathrm{km}$ ) optical path through atmospheric turbulence can be experimentally simulated in a controlled fashion and scaled down to distances easily accessible in a laboratory setting . this procedure is then used to simulate a 1-km - long free - space communication link in which information is encoded in orbital angular momentum ( oam ) spatial modes . we also demonstrate that standard adaptive optics methods can be used to mitigate many of the effects of thick atmospheric turbulence .
