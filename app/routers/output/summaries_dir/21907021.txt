this paper addresses multi - user quantum key distribution networks , in which any two users can mutually exchange a secret key without trusting any other nodes . the same network also supports conventional classical communications by assigning two different wavelength bands to quantum and classical signals . time and code division multiple access ( cdma ) techniques , within a passive star network , are considered . in the case of cdma , it turns out that the optimal performance is achieved at a unity code weight . a listen - before - send protocol is then proposed to improve secret key generation rates in this case . finally , a hybrid setup with wavelength routers and passive optical networks , which can support a large number of users , is considered and analyzed .
