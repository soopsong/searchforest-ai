this paper discusses the important role of controllability played on the complexity of optimizing quantum mechanical control systems . the study is based on a topology analysis of the corresponding quantum control landscape , which is referred to as the optimization objective as a functional of control fields . we find that the degree of controllability is closely relevant with the ruggedness of the landscape , which determines the search efficiency for global optima . this effect is demonstrated via the gate fidelity control landscape of a system whose controllability is restricted on a su(2 ) dynamic symmetry group . we show that multiple local false traps ( i.e. , non - global suboptima ) exist even if the target gate is realizable and that the number of these traps is increased by the loss of controllability , while the controllable systems are always devoid of false traps .
