when quantum fields are coupled to gravitational fields , spontaneous particle creation may occur similarly to when they are coupled to external electromagnetic fields . gravitational fields can be incorporated as background spacetime if the back - action of matter on it can be neglected , yielding modified dirac or klein - gordon equations for elementary fermions and bosons respectively . the semi - classical description predicts particle creation in many scenarios including expanding universe , near the event horizon of a black hole ( the hawking effect ) , and an accelerating observer in flat spacetime ( the unruh effect ) . in this work , we give a pedagogical introduction to the dirac equation in a general 2d spacetime and show examples of spinor wave packet dynamics in some background spacetimes . in particular , we cover the phenomenon of particle creation in a time - dependent metric . photonic analogs of these effects are then proposed , where classical light propagating in an array of coupled waveguides provides a visualisation of the dirac spinor propagating in curved 2d spacetime . the extent to which such a single - particle description can be said to mimic particle creation is discussed .
