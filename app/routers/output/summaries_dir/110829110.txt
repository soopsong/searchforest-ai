the imperfections of a receiver 's detector affect the performance of two - way continuous - variable quantum key distribution protocols and are difficult to adjust in practical situations . we propose a method to improve the performance of two - way continuous - variable quantum key distribution by adding a parameter - adjustable optical amplifier at the receiver . a security analysis is derived against a two - mode collective entangling cloner attack . our simulations show that the proposed method can improve the performance of protocols as long as the inherent noise of the amplifier is lower than a critical value , defined as the tolerable amplifier noise . furthermore , the optimal performance can approach the scenario where a perfect detector is used .
