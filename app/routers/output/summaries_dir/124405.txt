we show that the depth of quantum circuits in the realistic architecture where a classical controller determines which local interactions to apply on the kd grid z^k where k>= 2 is the same ( up to a constant factor ) as in the standard model where arbitrary interactions are allowed . this allows minimum - depth circuits ( up to a constant factor ) for the nearest - neighbor architecture to be obtained from minimum - depth circuits in the standard abstract model . our work therefore justifies the standard assumption that interactions can be performed between arbitrary pairs of qubits . in particular , our results imply that shor 's algorithm , controlled operations and fanouts can be implemented in constant depth , polynomial size and polynomial width in this architecture . we also present optimal non - adaptive quantum circuits for controlled operations and fanouts on a kd grid . these circuits have depth theta(n^(1 / k ) ) , size theta(n ) and width theta(n ) . our lower bound also applies to a more general class of operations .
