the technique of shortcuts to adiabaticity ( sta ) has attracted broad attention due to their possible applications in quantum information processing and quantum control . however , most studies published so far have been only focused on hermitian systems under the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) . in this paper , we propose a modified sta technique to realize population transfer for a non - hermitian system without rwa . we work out an exact expression for the control function and present examples consisting of two- and three - level systems with decay to show the theory . the results suggest that the sta technique presented here is robust for fast passages . we also find that the decay has small effect on the population transfer in the three - level system . to shed more light on the physics behind this result , we reduce the quantum three - level system to an effective two - level one with large detunings . the sta technique of effective two - level system is studied . thereby the high - fidelity population transfer can be implemented in non - hermitian systems by our method , and it works even without rwa .
