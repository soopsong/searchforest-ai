we present sqire , a low - level language for quantum computing and verification . sqire uses a global register of quantum bits , allowing easy compilation to and from existing ` quantum assembly ' languages and simplifying the verification process . we demonstrate the power of sqire as an intermediate representation of quantum programs by verifying a number of useful optimizations , and we demonstrate sqire 's use as a tool for general verification by proving several quantum programs correct .
