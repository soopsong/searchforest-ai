history dependent discrete time quantum walks ( qws ) are often studied for their lattice traversal properties . a particular model in the literature uses the state of a memory qubit at each site to record visits and to control the dynamics of the walk . we generalize this model to the neighborhood - history quantum walk ( nhqw ) , in which the walk dynamics and the state of the memory qubits in a neighborhood of the particle 's position are interdependent . to demonstrate it , we construct an nhqw on a one - dimensional lattice , with a simple neighborhood . several dynamically interesting history dependent qws can be realized as single - particle sectors of quantum lattice gas automata ( qlga ) . in contrast , the nhqw constructed in this paper is realized as a single - particle sector of the more general quantum cellular automaton ( qca ) . the complexity of the nhqw dynamics presents a promising avenue toward richer walk strategies and a potentially useful model of qws for the noisy intermediate - scale quantum ( nisq ) era of quantum computing . it also modifies qws to conceivably allow for modeling fundamental physics incorporating quantum field interactions with particles .
