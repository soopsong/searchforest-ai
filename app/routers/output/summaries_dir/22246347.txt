the dynamics of quantum expectation values is considered in a geometric setting . first , expectation values of the canonical operators are shown to be equivariant momentum maps for the action of the heisenberg group on quantum states . then , the hamiltonian structure of ehrenfest 's theorem is shown to be lie - poisson for a semidirect - product lie group , named the ` ehrenfest group ' . the underlying poisson structure produces classical and quantum mechanics as special limit cases . in addition , quantum dynamics is expressed in the frame of the expectation values , in which the latter undergo canonical hamiltonian motion . in the case of gaussian states , expectation values dynamics couples to second - order moments , which also enjoy a momentum map structure . eventually , gaussian states are shown to possess a lie - poisson structure associated to another semidirect - product group , which is called the jacobi group . this structure produces the energy - conserving variant of a class of gaussian moment models previously appeared in the chemical physics literature .
