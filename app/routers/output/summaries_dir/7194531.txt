we report a technique for encoding both amplitude and phase variations onto a laser beam using a single digital micro - mirror device ( dmd ) . using this technique , we generate laguerre - gaussian and vortex orbital - angular - momentum ( oam ) modes , along with modes in a set that is mutually unbiased with respect to the oam basis . additionally , we have demonstrated rapid switching among the generated modes at a speed of 4 khz , which is much faster than the speed regularly achieved by spatial light modulators ( slms ) . the dynamic control of both phase and amplitude of a laser beam is an enabling technology for classical communication and quantum key distribution ( qkd ) systems that employ spatial mode encoding .
