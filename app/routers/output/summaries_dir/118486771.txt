we investigate the use of quantum - jump - based feedback to manipulate the stability of multipartite entangled dark states in an open quantum system . using the model proposed in phys . rev . a 76 , 010301(r ) ( 2007 ) for a pair of atoms , we show a general strategy to produce many - body singlet stationary entangled states for larger number of atoms . in the case of four qubits , we propose a simple local feedback control that , although not optimal , is realistic and stabilises a highly entangled state . we discuss the limitations and analyse alternative strategies within the framework of direct jump feedback schemes .
