we prove a lower bound on the rate of greenberger - horne - zeilinger states distillable from pure multipartite states by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) . our proof is based on a modification of a combinatorial argument used in the fast matrix multiplication algorithm of coppersmith and winograd . previous use of methods from algebraic complexity in quantum information theory concerned transformations with stochastic local operations and classical operation ( slocc ) , resulting in an asymptotically vanishing success probability . in contrast , our new protocol works with asymptotically vanishing error .
