adiabatic techniques have much potential to realise practical and robust optical waveguide devices . traditionally photonic elements are limited to coupling schemes that rely on proximity to nearest neighbour elements . we combine adiabatic passage with a continuum based long - range optical bus to break free from such topological restraints and thereby outline a new approach to photonic quantum gate design . we explicitly show designs for adiabatic quantum gates that produce a hadamard , 50:50 and 1/3:2/3 beam splitter , and non - deterministic cnot gate based on planar thin , shallow ridge waveguides . our calculations are performed under conditions of one and two - photon inputs .
