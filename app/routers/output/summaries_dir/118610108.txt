we use a single ion as an movable electric field sensor with accuracies on the order of a few v / m . for this , we compensate undesired static electric fields in a planar rf trap and characterize the static fields over an extended region along the trap axis . we observe a strong buildup of stray charges around the loading region on the trap resulting in an electric field of up to 1.3 kv / m at the ion position . we also find that the profile of the stray field remains constant over a time span of a few months .
