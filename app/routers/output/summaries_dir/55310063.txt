highly nonclassical quantum states of light , characterized by wigner functions with negative values , have been created so far only in a heralded fashion . in this case , the desired output emerges rarely and randomly from a quantum - state generator . an important example is the heralded production of high - purity single - photon states , typically based on some nonlinear optical interaction . in contrast , on - demand single - photon sources were also reported , exploiting the quantized level structure of matter systems . these sources , however , lead to highly impure output states , composed mostly of vacuum . while such impure states may still exhibit certain single - photon - like features such as anti - bunching , they are not enough nonclassical for advanced quantum information processing . on the other hand , the intrinsic randomness of pure , heralded states can be circumvented by first storing and then releasing them on demand . here we propose such a controlled release , and we experimentally demonstrate it for heralded single photons . we employ two optical cavities , where the photons are both created and stored inside one cavity , and finally released through a dynamical tuning of the other cavity . we demonstrate storage times of up to 300 ns , while keeping the single - photon purity around 50 % after storage . this is the first demonstration of a negative wigner function at the output of an on - demand photon source or a quantum memory . in principle , our storage system is compatible with all kinds of nonclassical states , including those known to be essential for many advanced quantum information protocols .
