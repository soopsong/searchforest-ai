we theoretically investigate optical detection of a weak classical force acting on a free particle in a dissipative coupling optomechanical system with a degenerate parametric amplifier ( pa ) . we show that the pa allows one to achieve the force sensitivity far better than the standard quantum limit ( sql ) over a broad range of the detection frequencies . the improvement depends on the parametric gain and the driving power . moreover , we discuss the effects of the mechanical damping and the thermal noise on the force sensitivity . we find that the robustness of the force sensitivity much better than the sql against the mechanical damping and the thermal noise is achievable in the presence of the pa with a high parametric gain . for the temperature $ t = 1 $ k , the improvement in sensitivity is better by a factor of about 7 when the driving power is set at a value corresponding to the sql with no pa .
