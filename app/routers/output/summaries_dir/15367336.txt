we prove that the schr\"odinger equation is approximately controllable in sobolev spaces $ h^s$ , $ s>0 $ generically with respect to the potential . we give two applications of this result . first , in the case of one space dimension , combining our result with a local exact controllability property , we get the global exact controllability of the system in higher sobolev spaces . then we prove that the schr\"odinger equation with a potential which has a random time - dependent amplitude admits at most one stationary measure on the unit sphere $ s$ in $ l^2 $ .
