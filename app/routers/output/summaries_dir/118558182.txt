entanglement in a gaussian two - mode system can be generated by local driving if additional non - local features are introduced to the dynamics . we demonstrate that weak to moderate ohmic friction arising from a dissipative environment can enable entanglement generation in a driven system . this synergy of driving and dissipation is highly sensitive to the pulse shape ; several simple pulse shapes fail to produce this effect at all or deposit large amounts of energy in the system as a side effect . complex pulse shapes , determined by optimal control techniques , however , are effective without detrimental side effects .
