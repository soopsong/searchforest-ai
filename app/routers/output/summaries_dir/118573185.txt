we consider pulses of finite duration for coherent control in the presence of classical noise . we derive the corrections to ideal , instantaneous pulses for the case of general decoherence ( spin - spin relaxation and spin - lattice relaxation ) up to and including the third order in the duration \tau_p of the pulses . for pure dephasing ( spin - spin relaxation only ) , we design \pi and \pi/2 pulses with amplitude and/or frequency modulation which resemble the ideal ones up to and including the second order in \tau_p . for completely general decoherence including spin - lattice relaxation the corrections are computed up to and including the second order in \tau_p as well . frequency modulated pulses are determined which resemble the ideal ones . they are used to design a low - amplitude replacement for xy8 cycles . in comparison with pulses designed to compensate quantum noise less conditions have to be fulfilled . consequently , we find that the classical pulses can be weaker and simpler than the corresponding pulses in the quantum case .
