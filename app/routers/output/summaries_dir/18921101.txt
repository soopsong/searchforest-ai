we consider group - covariant positive operator valued measures ( povms ) on a finite dimensional quantum system . following neumark 's theorem a povm can be implemented by an orthogonal measurement on a larger system . accordingly , our goal is to find an implementation of a given group - covariant povm by a quantum circuit using its symmetry . based on representation theory of the symmetry group we develop a general approach for the implementation of group - covariant povms which consist of rank - one operators . the construction relies on a method to decompose matrices that intertwine two representations of a finite group . we give several examples for which the resulting quantum circuits are efficient . in particular , we obtain efficient quantum circuits for a class of povms generated by weyl - heisenberg groups . these circuits allow to implement an approximative simultaneous measurement of the position and crystal momentum of a particle moving on a cyclic chain .
