in a quantum computation with pure states , the generation of large amounts of entanglement is known to be necessary for a speedup with respect to classical computations . however , examples of quantum computations with mixed states are known , such as the deterministic computation with one quantum qubit ( dqc1 ) model [ knill and laflamme , phys . rev . lett . 81 , 5672 ( 1998 ) ] , in which entanglement is at most marginally present , and yet a computational speedup is believed to occur . correlations , and not entanglement , have been identified as a necessary ingredient for mixed - state quantum computation speedups . here we show that correlations , as measured through the operator schmidt rank , are indeed present in large amounts in the dqc1 circuit . this provides evidence for the preclusion of efficient classical simulation of dqc1 by means of a whole class of classical simulation algorithms , thereby reinforcing the conjecture that dqc1 leads to a genuine quantum computational speedup .
