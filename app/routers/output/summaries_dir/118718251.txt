the connectivity and tunability of superconducting qubits and resonators provide us with an appealing platform to study the many - body physics of microwave excitations . here we present a multi - connected jaynes - cummings lattice model which is symmetric with respect to the nonlocal qubit - resonator couplings . our calculation shows that this model exhibits a mott insulator - superfluid - mott insulator phase transition , featured by a reentry to the mott insulator phase , at commensurate filling . the phase diagrams in the grand canonical ensemble are also derived , which confirm the incompressibility of the mott insulator phase . different from a general - purposed quantum computer , it only requires two operations to demonstrate this phase transition : the preparation and the detection of the commensurate many - body ground state . we discuss the realization of these operations in a superconducting circuit .
