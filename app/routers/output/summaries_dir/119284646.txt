we derive the effect of the schr\"odinger -- newton equation , which can be considered as a non - relativistic limit of classical gravity , for a composite quantum system in the regime of high energies . such meson - antimeson systems exhibit very unique properties , e.g. distinct masses due to strong and electroweak interactions . we find conceptually different physical scenarios due to lacking of a clear physical guiding principle which mass is the relevant one and due to the fact that it is not clear how the flavor wave - function relates to the spatial wave - function . there seems to be no principal contradiction . however , a nonlinear extension of the schr\"odinger equation in this manner strongly depends on the relation between the flavor wave - function and spatial wave - function and its particular shape . in opposition to the continuous spontaneous localization collapse models we find a change in the oscillating behavior and not in the damping of the flavor oscillation .
