numerical optimization methods such as hillclimbing and simulated annealing have been applied to search for highly entangled multi - qubit states . here the genetic algorithm is applied to this optimization problem -- to search not only for highly entangled states , but also for the corresponding quantum circuits creating these states . simple quantum circuits for maximally ( highly ) entangled states are discovered for 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6-qubit systems ; and extension of the method to systems with more qubits is discussed . among other results we have found explicit quantum circuits for maximally entangled 5 and 6-qubit circuits , with only 8 and 13 quantum gates respectively . one significant advantage of our method over previous ones is that it allows very simple construction of quantum circuits based on the quantum states found .
