we present a fully quantum mechanical treatment of optically rephased photon echoes . these echoes exhibit noise due to amplified spontaneous emission , however this noise can be seen as a consequence of the entanglement between the atoms and the output light . with a rephasing pulse one can get an"echo"of the amplified spontaneous emission , leading to light with nonclassical correlations at points separated in time , which is of interest in the context of building wide bandwidth quantum repeaters . we also suggest a wideband version of dlcz protocol based on the same ideas .
