in this technical paper we introduce the tensor network theory ( tnt ) library -- an open - source software project aimed at providing a platform for rapidly developing robust , easy to use and highly optimised code for tnt calculations . the objectives of this paper are ( i ) to give an overview of the structure of tnt library , and ( ii ) to help scientists decide whether to use the tnt library in their research . we show how to employ the tnt routines by giving examples of ground - state and dynamical calculations of one - dimensional bosonic lattice systems . we also discuss different options for gaining access to the software available at http://www.tensornetworktheory.org .
