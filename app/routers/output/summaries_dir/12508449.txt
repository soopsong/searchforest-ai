we study the problem of leader selection in leader - follower multi - agent systems that are subject to stochastic disturbances . this problem arises in applications such as vehicle formation control , distributed clock synchronization , and distributed localization in sensor networks . we pose a new leader selection problem called the in - network leader selection problem . initially , an arbitrary node is selected to be a leader , and in all consequent steps the network must have exactly one leader . the agents must collaborate to find the leader that minimizes the variance of the deviation from the desired trajectory , and they must do so within the network using only communication between neighbors . to develop a solution for this problem , we first show a connection between the leader selection problem and a class of discrete facility location problems . we then leverage a previously proposed self - stabilizing facility location algorithm to develop a self - stabilizing in - network leader selection algorithm for acyclic graphs .
