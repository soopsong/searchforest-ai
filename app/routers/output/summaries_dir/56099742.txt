the long - standing paradigm of maxwell 's demon is till nowadays a frequently investigated issue , which still provides interesting insights into basic physical questions . considering a single - electron transistor , where we implement a maxwell demon by a piecewise - constant feedback protocol , we investigate quantum implications of the maxwell demon . to this end , we harness a dynamical coarse - graining method , which provides a convenient and accurate description of the system dynamics even for high measurement rates . in doing so , we are able to investigate the maxwell demon in a quantum - zeno regime leading to transport blockade . we argue that there is a measurement rate providing an optimal performance . moreover , we find that besides building up a chemical gradient , there can be also a regime where additionally the system under consideration provides energy to the demon due to the quantum measurement .
