we describe a methodology and standard of proof for experimental claims of quantum random number generation ( qrng ) , analogous to well - established methods from precision measurement . for appropriately constructed physical implementations , lower bounds on the quantum contribution to the average min - entropy can be derived from measurements on the qrng output . given these bounds , randomness extractors allow generation of nearly perfect"{\epsilon}-random"bit streams . an analysis of experimental uncertainties then gives experimentally derived confidence levels on the { \epsilon } randomness of these sequences . we demonstrate the methodology by application to phase - diffusion qrng , driven by spontaneous emission as a trusted randomness source . all other factors , including classical phase noise , amplitude fluctuations , digitization errors and correlations due to finite detection bandwidth , are treated with paranoid caution , i.e. , assuming the worst possible behaviors consistent with observations . a data - constrained numerical optimization of the distribution of untrusted parameters is used to lower bound the average min - entropy . under this paranoid analysis , the qrng remains efficient , generating at least 2.3 quantum random bits per symbol with 8-bit digitization and at least 0.83 quantum random bits per symbol with binary digitization , at a confidence level of 0.99993 . the result demonstrates ultrafast qrng with strong experimental guarantees .
