quantum computers provide a fundamentally new computing paradigm that promises to revolutionize our ability to solve broad classes of problems . surprisingly , the basic mathematical structures of gate - based quantum computing , such as unitary operations on a finite - dimensional hilbert space , are not unique to quantum systems but may be found in certain classical systems as well . previously , it has been shown that one can represent an arbitrary multi - qubit quantum state in terms of classical analog signals using nested quadrature amplitude modulated signals . furthermore , using digitally controlled analog electronics one may manipulate these signals to perform quantum gate operations and thereby execute quantum algorithms . the computational capacity of a single signal is , however , limited by the required bandwidth , which scales exponentially with the number of qubits when represented using frequency - based encoding . to overcome this limitation , we introduce a method to extend this approach to multiple parallel signals . doing so allows a larger quantum state to be emulated with the same gate time required for processing frequency - encoded signals . in the proposed representation , each doubling of the number of signals corresponds to an additional qubit in the spatial domain . single quit gate operations are similarly extended so as to operate on qubits represented using either frequency - based or spatial encoding schemes . furthermore , we describe a method to perform gate operations between pairs of qubits represented using frequency or spatial encoding or between frequency - based and spatially encoded qubits . finally , we describe how this approach may be extended to represent qubits in the time domain as well .
