we introduce an adiabatic long - range quantum communication proposal based on a quantum dot array . by adiabatically varying the external gate voltage applied on the system , the quantum information encoded in the electron can be transported from one end dot to another . we numerically solve the schr\"odinger equation for a system with a given number of quantum dots . it is shown that this scheme is a simple and efficient protocol to coherently manipulate the population transfer under suitable gate pulses . the dependence of the energy gap and the transfer time on system parameters is analyzed and shown numerically . we also investigate the adiabatic passage in a more realistic system in the presence of inevitable fabrication imperfections . this method provides guidance for future realizations of adiabatic quantum state transfer in experiments .
