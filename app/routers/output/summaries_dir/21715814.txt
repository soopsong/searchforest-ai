photonic quantum technologies are on the verge of finding applications in everyday life with quantum cryptography and the quantum internet on the horizon . extensive research has been carried out to determine suitable quantum emitters and single epitaxial quantum dots are emerging as near - optimal sources of bright , on - demand , highly indistinguishable single photons and entangled photon pairs . in order to build up quantum networks , it is now essential to interface remote quantum emitters . however , this is still an outstanding challenge , as the quantum states of dissimilar ' artificial atoms ' have to be prepared on - demand with high fidelity , and the generated photons have to be made indistinguishable in all possible degrees of freedom . here , we overcome this major obstacle and show an unprecedented two - photon interference ( visibility of 51+/-5 % ) from remote strain - tunable gaas quantum dots , emitting on - demand photon - pairs . we achieve this result by exploiting for the first time the full potential of the novel phonon - assisted two - photon excitation scheme , which allows for the generation of highly indistinguishable ( visibility of 71+/-9 % ) entangled photon - pairs ( fidelity of 90+/-2 % ) , it enables push - to button biexciton state preparation ( fidelity of 80+/-2 % ) and it outperforms conventional resonant two - photon excitation schemes in terms of robustness against environmental decoherence . our results mark an important milestone for the practical realization of quantum repeaters and complex multi - photon entanglement experiments involving dissimilar artificial atoms .
