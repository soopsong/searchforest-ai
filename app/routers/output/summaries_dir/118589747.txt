linear optical elements are pivotal instruments in the manipulation of classical and quantum states of light . the vast progress in integrated quantum photonic technology enables the implementation of large numbers of such elements on chip while providing interferometric stability . as a trade - off these structures face the intrinsic challenge of characterizing their optical transformation as individual optical elements are not directly accessible . thus the unitary transformation needs to be reconstructed from a dataset generated with having access to the input and output ports of the device only . here we present a novel approach to unitary reconstruction that significantly improves upon existing approaches . we compare its performance to several approaches via numerical simulations for networks up to 14 modes . we show that an adapted version of our approach allows to recover all mode - dependent losses and to obtain highest reconstruction fidelities under such conditions .
