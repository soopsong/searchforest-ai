we conduct experimental simulations of many body quantum systems using a \emph{hybrid } classical - quantum algorithm . in our setup , the wave function of the transverse field quantum ising model is represented by a restricted boltzmann machine . this neural network is then trained using variational monte carlo assisted by a d - wave quantum sampler to find the ground state energy . our results clearly demonstrate that already the first generation of quantum computers can be harnessed to tackle non - trivial problems concerning physics of many body quantum systems .
