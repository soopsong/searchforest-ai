achieving nonreciprocal light propagation in photonic circuits is essential to control signal crosstalk and optical back - scatter . however , realizing high - fidelity nonreciprocity in low - loss integrated photonic systems remains challenging . in this paper , we experimentally demonstrate a device concept based on nonlocal acousto - optic light scattering to produce nonreciprocal single - sideband modulation and mode conversion in an integrated silicon photonic platform . in this process , a traveling - wave acoustic phonon driven via optical forces in a silicon waveguide is used to modulate light in a spatially separate waveguide through a linear inter - band brillouin scattering process . we demonstrate up to 38 db of nonreciprocity with 37 db of single - sideband suppression . in contrast to prior brillouin- and optomechanics - based schemes for nonreciprocity , the bandwidth of this scattering process is set through optical phase - matching , not acoustic or optical resonances . as a result , record - large bandwidths in excess of 125 ghz are realized , with potential for significant further improvement through optical dispersion engineering . tunability of the nonreciprocal modulator operation wavelength over a 35 nm bandwidth is demonstrated by varying the optical pump wavelength . such traveling - wave acousto - optic modulators provide a promising path toward the realization of broadband , low - loss isolators and circulators in integrated photonic circuits .
