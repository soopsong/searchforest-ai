we have investigated the one - way surface plasmon - polariton ( spp ) at the interface of a continuous magneto - plasma material and metal . we demonstrated that tm modes inside a continuous material can be assigned non - trivial chern numbers analogous to those of topological photonic crystals ; moreover these chern numbers can be calculated analytically . this leads to the appearance of topologically protected surface modes propagating at frequencies inside the bandgap of the magneto - plasma . previous works considered 2d structures ; here we consider the effects of 3d defects , and show that , although backward propagation / reflection can not occur , side scattering does take place and it has significant effect on the propagation of the surface mode . several different waveguiding geometries are considered for reducing the effects of side - scattering , and we also consider the effects of metal loss .
