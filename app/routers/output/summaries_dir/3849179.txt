the transcritical bifurcation without parameters ( tbwp ) describes a stability change along a line of equilibria , resulting from the loss of normal hyperbolicity at a given point of such a line . memristive circuits systematically yield manifolds of non - isolated equilibria , and in this paper we address a systematic characterization of the tbwp in circuits with a single memristor . to achieve this we develop two mathematical results of independent interest ; the first one is an extension of the tbwp theorem to explicit ordinary differential equations ( odes ) in arbitrary dimension ; the second result drives the characterization of this phenomenon to semiexplicit differential - algebraic equations ( daes ) , which provide the appropriate framework for the analysis of circuit dynamics . in the circuit context the analysis is performed in graph - theoretic terms : in this setting , our first working scenario is restricted to passive problems ( exception made of the bifurcating memristor ) , and in a second step some results are presented for the analysis of non - passive cases . the latter context is illustrated by means of a memristive neural network model .
