we discuss the implementation of arbitrary precision composite pulses developed using the methods of brown et al . [ phys . rev . a 70 ( 2004 ) 052318 ] . we give explicit results for pulse sequences designed to tackle both the simple case of pulse length errors and for the more complex case of off - resonance errors . the results are developed in the context of nmr quantum computation , but could be applied more widely .
