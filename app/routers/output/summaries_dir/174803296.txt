we investigate the scrambling of information in a hierarchical star - topology system using out - of - time - ordered correlation ( otoc ) functions . the system consists of a central qubit directly interacting with a set of satellite qubits , which in turn interact with a second layer of satellite qubits . this particular topology not only allows convenient preparation and filtering of multiple quantum coherences between the central qubit and the first layer but also to engineer scrambling in a controlled manner . hence , it provides us with an opportunity to experimentally study scrambling of information localized in multi - spin correlations via the construction of relevant otocs . since the measurement of otoc requires a time evolution , the non - scrambling processes such as decoherence and certain experimental errors create an ambiguity . therefore , the unambiguous quantification of information scrambling requires suppressing contributions from decoherence to the otoc dynamics . to this end , we propose and experimentally demonstrate a constant time protocol which is able to filter contribution exclusively from information scrambling .
