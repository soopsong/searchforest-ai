the entanglement behavior of two classes of multi - qubit system , ghz and ghz like states passing through a generalized amplitude damping channel is discussed . despite this channel causes degradation of the entangled properties and consequently their abilities to perform quantum teleportation , one can always improve the lower values of the entanglement and the fidelity of the teleportrd state by controlling on bell measurements , analyzer angle and channel 's strength . using ghz - like state within a generalized amplitude damping channel is much better than using the normal ghz - state , where the decay rate of entanglement and the fidelity of the teleported states are smaller than those depicted for ghz state .
