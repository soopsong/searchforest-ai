in this paper we investigate parametrization - free solutions of the problem of quantum pure state preparation and subspace stabilization by means of hamiltonian control , continuous measurement and quantum feedback , in the presence of a markovian environment . in particular , we show that whenever suitable dissipative effects are induced either by the unmonitored environment or by non hermitian measurements , there is no need for feedback control to accomplish the task . constructive necessary and sufficient conditions on the form of the open - loop controller can be provided in this case . when open - loop control is not sufficient , filtering - based feedback control laws steering the evolution towards a target pure state are provided , which generalize those available in the literature .
