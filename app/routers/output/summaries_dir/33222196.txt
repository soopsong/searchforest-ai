we investigate the fourier transform of the current through a memristor when the applied - voltage frequency is smaller than the characteristic memristor frequency , and the memristor shows hysteresis in the current - voltage plane . we find that when the hysteresis curve is"smooth " , the current fourier transform has weights at odd and even harmonics that decay rapidly and monotonically with the order of the harmonic ; when the hysteresis curve is"sharp " , the fourier transform of the current is significantly broader , with non - monotonic weights at high harmonics . we present a simple model which shows that this qualitative change in the fourier spectrum is solely driven by the saturation of memristance during a voltage cycle , and not independently by various system parameters such as applied or memristor frequencies , and the non - linear dopant drift .
