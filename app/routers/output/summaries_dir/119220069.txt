optical quantum memory is an essential element for long distance quantum communication and photonic quantum computation protocols . the practical implementation of such protocols requires an efficient quantum memory with long coherence time . beating the no - cloning limit , for example , requires efficiencies above 50\% . an ideal optical fibre loop has a loss of 50 % in 100 $ \mu$ s , and until now no universal quantum memory has beaten this time - efficiency limit . here , we report results of a gradient echo memory ( gem ) experiment in a cold atomic ensemble with a 1 / e coherence time up to 1ms and maximum efficiency up to 87$\pm$2 % for short storage times . our experimental data demonstrates greater than 50 % efficiency for storage times up to 0.6ms . quantum storage ability is verified beyond the ideal fibre limit using heterodyne tomography of small coherent states .
