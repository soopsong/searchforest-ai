the ultrastrong light - matter interaction regime was investigated in metallic and superconducting complementary split ring resonators coupled to the cyclotron transition of two dimensional electron gases . the sub - wavelength light confinement and the large optical dipole moment of the cyclotron transition yield record high normalized coupling rates of up to $ \frac{\omega_r}{\omega_c}=$ 0.87 . we observed a blue - shift of both polaritons due to the diamagnetic term of the interaction hamiltonian .
