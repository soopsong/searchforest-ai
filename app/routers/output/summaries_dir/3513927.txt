quantum metrology is the state - of - the - art measurement technology . it uses quantum resources to enhance the sensitivity of phase estimation beyond what reachable within classical physics . while single parameter estimation theory has been widely investigated , much less is known about the simultaneous estimation of multiple phases , which finds key applications in imaging and sensing . in this manuscript we provide conditions of useful entanglement ( among multimode particles , qudits ) for multiphase estimation and adapt them to multiarm mach - zehnder interferometry . we discuss benchmark multimode fock states containing useful qudit entanglement and overcoming the sensitivity of separable qudit states in three and four arm mach - zehnder - like interferometers - currently within the reach of integrated photonics technology .
