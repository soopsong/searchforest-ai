flexible solution processed memristors show different behaviour dependent on the choice of electrode material . use of gold for both electrodes leads to switchable worm ( write once read many times ) resistive devices . use of aluminium for both electrodes increases the richness of behaviour allowing both curved and triangular memristive switching resistance memories . a comparison device with an aluminium bottom electrode and gold top electrode only exhibited significant memristive resistance switching when the aluminium electrode was the cathode , suggesting that the electrode is acting as a source / sink of oxygen anions . when the gold electrode was the cathode this electrode was deformed by oxygen evolution . these results demonstrate that aluminium is helpful for stabilising and promoting memristive behaviour in sol - gel tio$_2 $ devices and that changing electrodes from aluminium to gold creates fundamentally different device characteristics .
