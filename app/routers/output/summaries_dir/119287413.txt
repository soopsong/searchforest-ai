we present a robust tool to analyze nonclassical properties of multimode twin - beam states in the mesoscopic photon - number domain . the measurements are performed by direct detection . the analysis exploits three different non - classicality criteria for detected photons exhibiting complementary behavior in the explored intensity regime . joint signal - idler photon - number distributions and quasi - distributions of integrated intensities are determined and compared with the corresponding distributions of detected photons . experimental conditions optimal for nonclassical properties of twin - beam states are identified .
