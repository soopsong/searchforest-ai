the quantum noise in a linear amplifier is shown to be thermal noise . the theory of linear amplifiers is applied first to the simplest , single or double oscillator model of an amplifier , and then to linear model of an amplifier with continuous fields and input and outputs . finally it is shown that the thermal noise emitted by black holes first demonstrated by hawking , and of dumb holes ( sonic and other analogs to black holes ) , arises from the same analysis as for linear amplifiers . the amplifier noise of black holes acting as amplifiers on the quantum fields living in the spacetime surrounding the black hole is the radiation discovered by hawking . for any amplifier , that quantum noise is completely characterized by the attributes of the system regarded as a classical amplifier , and arises out of those classical amplification factors and the commutation relations of quantum mechanics .
