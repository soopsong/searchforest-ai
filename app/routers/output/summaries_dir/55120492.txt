we consider a measurement of the position of a spot painted on the surface of a trapped nano - optomechanical sphere . the measurement extracts information about the position of the spot and in doing so measures a combination of the orientation and position of the sphere . the quantum back - action of the measurement entangles and correlates these two degrees of freedom . such a measurement is not available for atoms or ions , and provides a mechanism to probe the quantum mechanical properties of trapped optomechanical spheres . in performing simulations of this measurement process we also test a numerical method introduced recently by rouchon and collaborators for solving stochastic master equations . this method guarantees the positivity of the density matrix when the lindblad operators for all simultaneous continuous measurements are mutually commuting . we show that it is both simpler and far more efficient than previous methods .
