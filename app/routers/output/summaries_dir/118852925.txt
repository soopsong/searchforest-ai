the accurate and reliable characterization of quantum dynamical processes underlies efforts to validate quantum technologies , where discrimination between competing models of observed behaviors inform efforts to fabricate and operate qubit devices . we present a novel protocol for quantum channel discrimination that leverages advances in direct characterization of quantum dynamics ( dcqd ) codes . we demonstrate that dcqd codes enable selective process tomography to improve discrimination between entangling and correlated quantum dynamics . numerical simulations show selective process tomography requires only a few measurement configurations to achieve a low false alarm rate and that the dcqd encoding improves the resilience of the protocol to hidden sources of noise . our results show that selective process tomography with dcqd codes is useful for efficiently distinguishing sources of correlated crosstalk from uncorrelated noise in current and future experimental platforms .
