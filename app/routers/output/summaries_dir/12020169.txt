we introduce a multi - coin discrete quantum random walk where the amplitude for a coin flip depends upon previous tosses . although the corresponding classical random walk is unbiased , a bias can be introduced into the quantum walk by varying the history dependence . by mixing the biased random walk with an unbiased one , the direction of the bias can be reversed leading to a new quantum version of parrondo 's paradox .
