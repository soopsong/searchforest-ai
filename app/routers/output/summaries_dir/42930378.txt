measurement is the only part of a general quantum system that has yet to be characterized experimentally in a complete manner . detector tomography provides a procedure for doing just this ; an arbitrary measurement device can be fully characterized , and thus calibrated , in a systematic way without access to its components or its design . the result is a reconstructed povm containing the measurement operators associated with each measurement outcome . we consider two detectors , a single - photon detector and a photon - number counter , and propose an easily realized experimental apparatus to perform detector tomography on them . we also present a method of visualizing the resulting measurement operators .
