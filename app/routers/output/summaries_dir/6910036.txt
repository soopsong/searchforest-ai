nature inspired neuromorphic architectures are being explored as an alternative to imminent limitations of conventional complementary metal - oxide semiconductor ( cmos ) architectures . utilization of such architectures for practical applications like advanced pattern recognition tasks will require synaptic connections that are both reconfigurable and stable . here , we report realization of stable atomic - switch networks ( asn ) , with inherent complex connectivity , self - assembled from percolating metal nanoparticles ( nps ) . the device conductance reflects the configuration of synapses which can be modulated via voltage stimulus . by controlling relative humidity ( rh ) and oxygen partial - pressure during np deposition we obtain stochastic conductance switching that is stable over several months . detailed characterization reveals signatures of electric - field induced atomic - wire formation within the tunnel - gaps of the oxidized percolating network . finally we show that the synaptic structure can be reconfigured by stimulating at different repetition rates , which can be utilized as short - term to long - term memory conversion . this demonstration of stable stochastic switching in asns provides a promising route to hardware implementation of biological neuronal models and , as an example , we highlight possible applications in reservoir computing ( rc ) .
