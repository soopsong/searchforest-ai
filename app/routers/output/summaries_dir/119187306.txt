quantum mechanics is a cornerstone of our current understanding of nature and extremely successful in describing physics covering a huge range of scales . however , its interpretation remains controversial since the early days of quantum mechanics . what does a quantum state really mean ? is there any way out of the so - called quantum measurement problem ? here we present an information - complete quantum theory ( icqt ) and the trinary property of nature to beat the above problems . we assume that a quantum system 's state provides an information - complete description of the system in the trinary picture . we give a consistent formalism of quantum theory that makes the information - completeness explicitly and argue that conventional quantum mechanics is an approximation of the icqt . we then show how our icqt provides a coherent picture and fresh angle of some existing problems in physics . the computational content of our theory is uncovered by defining an information - complete quantum computer .
