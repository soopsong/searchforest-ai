in this study the determinant of the average quadratic error matrix is used as the measure of state estimation efficiency . this quantity is easily computable in some cases , so it gives us a reasonable tool to find optimal measurement setup for different quantum tomography problems . we present numerous applications for a single qubit when von neumann measurements or a single povm is used and a part of the parameters of the state is given . under some restriction the optimality is found for $ n$-level system as well . the optimal measurements have some complementary relation to each other or to the known datas , moreover , symmetric informationally complete systems appear , the conditional version seems to be new .
