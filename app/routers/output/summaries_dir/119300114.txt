demonstrating quantum supremacy , a complexity - guaranteed quantum advantage against over the best classical algorithms by using less universal quantum devices , is an important near - term milestone for quantum information processing . here we develop a threshold theorem for quantum supremacy with noisy quantum circuits in the pre - threshold region , where quantum error correction does not work directly . we show that , even in such a region , we can virtually simulate quantum error correction by postselection . this allows us to show that the output sampled from the noisy quantum circuits ( without postselection ) can not be simulated efficiently by classical computers based on a stable complexity theoretical conjecture , i.e. , non - collapse of the polynomial hierarchy . by applying this to fault - tolerant quantum computation with the surface codes , we obtain the threshold value $ 2.84\%$ for quantum supremacy , which is much higher than the standard threshold $ 0.75\%$ for universal fault - tolerant quantum computation with the same circuit - level noise model . moreover , contrast to the standard noise threshold , the origin of quantum supremacy in noisy quantum circuits is quite clear ; the threshold is determined purely by the threshold of magic state distillation , which is essential to gain a quantum advantage .
