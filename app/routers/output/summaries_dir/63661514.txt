we present a scalable scheme for executing the error - correction cycle of a monolithic surface - code fabric composed of fast - flux - tuneable transmon qubits with nearest - neighbor coupling . an eight - qubit unit cell forms the basis for repeating both the quantum hardware and coherent control , enabling spatial multiplexing . this control uses three fixed frequencies for all single - qubit gates and a unique frequency detuning pattern for each qubit in the cell . by pipelining the interaction and readout steps of ancilla - based $ x$- and $ z$-type stabilizer measurements , we can engineer detuning patterns that avoid all second - order transmon - transmon interactions except those exploited in controlled - phase gates , regardless of fabric size . our scheme is applicable to defect - based and planar logical qubits , including lattice surgery .
