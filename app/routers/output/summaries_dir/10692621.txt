using bloch 's parametrization for qudits ( $ d$-level quantum systems ) , we write the hilbert - schmidt distance ( hsd ) between two generic $ n$-qudit states as an euclidean distance between two vectors of observables mean values in $ \mathbb{r}^{\pi_{s=1}^{n}d_{s}^{2}-1}$ , where $ d_{s}$ is the dimension for qudit $ s$. then , applying the generalized gell mann 's matrices to generate $ su(d_{s})$ , we use that result to obtain the hilbert - schmidt quantum coherence ( hsc ) of $ n$-qudit systems . as examples , we consider in details one - qubit , one - qutrit , two - qubit , and two copies of one - qubit states . in this last case , the possibility for controlling local and non - local coherences by tuning local populations is studied and the contrasting behaviors of hsc , $ l_{1}$-norm coherence , and relative entropy of coherence in this regard are noticed . we also investigate the decoherent dynamics of these coherence functions under the action of qutrit dephasing and dissipation channels . at last , we analyze the non - monotonicity of hsd under tensor products and report the first instance of a consequence ( for coherence quantification ) of this kind of property of a quantum distance measure .
