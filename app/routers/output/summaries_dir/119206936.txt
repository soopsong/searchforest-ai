a lattice of trapped atoms strongly coupled to a one - dimensional nanophotonic waveguide is investigated in exploiting the concept of polariton as the system natural eigenstate . we apply a bosonization procedure , which was presented separately by p. w. anderson and v. m. agranovich , to transform excitation spin - half operators into interacting bosons , and which shown here to confirm the hard - core boson model . we derive polariton - polariton kinematic interactions and study them by solving the scattering problem . in using the excitation - photon detuning as a control parameter , we examine the regime in which polaritons behave as weakly interacting photons , and propose the system for realizing superfluidity of photons . we implement the kinematic interaction as a mechanism for nonlinear optical processes that provide an observation tool for the system properties , e.g. the interaction strength produces a blue shift in pump - probe experiments .
