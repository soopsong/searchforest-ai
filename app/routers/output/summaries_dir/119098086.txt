we show , using quasi - exact numerical simulations , that anderson localization of one - dimensional particles in a disordered potential survives in the presence of attractive interaction between particles . the localization length of the composite particle can be computed analytically for weak disorder and is in good agreement with the quasi - exact numerical observations using time evolving block decimation . our approach allows for simulation of the entire experiment including the final measurement of all atom positions .
