recently shi proved that toffoli and hadamard are universal for quantum computation . this is perhaps the simplest universal set of gates that one can hope for , conceptually ; it shows that one only needs to add the hadamard gate to make a ' classical ' set of gates quantum universal . in this note we give a few lines proof of this fact relying on kitaev 's universal set of gates , and discuss the meaning of the result .
