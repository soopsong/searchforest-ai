dedicated research into the design and construction of a large scale quantum information processing ( qip ) system is a complicated task . the design of an experimentally feasible quantum processor must draw upon results in multiple fields ; from experimental efforts in system control and fabrication through to far more abstract areas such as quantum algorithms and error correction . recently , the adaptation of topological coding models to physical systems in optics has illustrated a possible long term pathway to truly large scale qip . as the topological model has well defined protocols for quantum error correction ( qec ) built in as part of its construction , a more grounded analysis of the { \em classical } processing requirements is possible . in this paper we analyze the requirements for a classical processing system , designed specifically for the topological cluster state model . we demonstrate that via extensive parallelization , the construction of a classical"front - end"system capable of processing error correction data for a large topological computer is possible today .
