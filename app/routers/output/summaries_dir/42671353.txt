we present a scheme for a photon - counting detection system that can be operated at incident photon rates higher than otherwise possible by suppressing the effects of detector deadtime . the method uses an array of n detectors and a 1-by - n optical switch with a control circuit to direct input light to live detectors . our calculations and models highlight the advantages of the technique . in particular , using this scheme , a group of n detectors provides an improvement in operation rate that can exceed the improvement that would be obtained by a single detector with deadtime reduced by 1 / n , even if it were feasible to produce a single detector with such a large improvement in deadtime . we model the system for continuous and pulsed light sources , both of which are important for quantum metrology and quantum key distribution applications .
