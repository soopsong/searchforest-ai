when a physical system is subjected to a strong external multi - frequency drive , its dynamics can be conveniently represented in the multi - dimensional floquet lattice . the number of the floquet lattice dimensions equals the number of { \em irrationally}-related drive frequencies , and the evolution occurs in response to a built - in effective"electric"field , whose components are proportional to the corresponding drive frequencies . the mapping allows to engineer and study temporal analogs of many real - space phenomena . here we focus on the specific example of a two - level system under two - frequency drive that induces topologically nontrivial band structure in the 2d floquet space . the observable consequence of such construction is quantized pumping of energy between the sources with frequencies $ \omega_1 $ and $ \omega_2$. when the system is initialized into a floquet band with the chern number $ c$ , the pumping occurs at the rate $ p_{12 } = -p_{21}= ( c/2\pi)\hbar \omega_1\omega_2 $ , an exact counterpart of the transverse current in a conventional topological insulator .
