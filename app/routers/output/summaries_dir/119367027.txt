based on the work of gao - jafferis - wall and maldacena - stanford - yang , we observe that the time - shifted thermofield states of two entangled cfts can be made traversable by an appropriate coupling of the two cfts , or alternatively by the application of a modified quantum teleportation protocol . this provides evidence for the smoothness of the horizon for a large class of entangled states related to the thermofield by time - translations . the smoothness of these states has some relevance for the firewall paradox and the proposal that some observables in quantum gravity may be state - dependent . we notice that quantum teleportation through these entangled states could be used in a laboratory setup to implement a time - machine , which allows the observer to travel far in the future .
