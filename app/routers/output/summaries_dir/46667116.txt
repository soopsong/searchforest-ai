in this paper we propose that bubbles of ads within minkowski spacetime , stabilized at a finite radius by stiff matter and an electromagnetic gas , can be an alternative endpoint of gravitational collapse . the bubbles are horizonless with a size up to 12.5 % larger than their schwarzschild radius depending on their charge . we argue that they are stable against small perturbations , and have thermodynamical properties similar to those of real black holes . we provide a realization of the bubbles within string theory that relies on a specific brane intersection giving rise to a shell carrying dissolved charges from lower dimensional d - branes as well as a gas of open strings . we also note that our construction provides a new way of understanding the entropy of reissner - nordstr\"om black holes in the extremal limit .
