the connectivity and tunability of superconducting quantum devices provide a rich platform to build quantum simulators and study novel many - body physics . here we study quantum phase transition in a detuned multi - connected jaynes - cummings lattice , which can be constructed with superconducting circuits . this model is composed of alternatively connected qubits and cavity modes . using a numerical method , we show that by varying the detuning between the qubits and the cavities , a phase transition from the superfluid phase to the mott insulator phase occurs at commensurate fillings in a one - dimensional array . we study the phase transition in lattices with symmetric and asymmetric couplings , respectively .
