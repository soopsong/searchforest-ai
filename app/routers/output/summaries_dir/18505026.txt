hyperentanglement , the entanglement in several degrees of freedom ( dofs ) of a quantum system , has attracted much attention as it can be used to increase both the channel capacity of quantum communication and its security largely . here , we present the first scheme to completely distinguish the hyperentangled bell states of two - photon systems in three dofs with the help of cross - kerr nonlinearity without destruction , including two longitudinal momentum dofs and the polarization dof . we use cross - kerr nonlinearity to construct quantum nondemolition detectors which can be used to make a parity - check measurement and analyze bell states of two - photon systems in different dofs . our complete scheme for two - photon six - qubit hyperentangled bell - state analysis may be useful for the practical applications in quantum information , especially in long - distance high - capacity quantum communication .
