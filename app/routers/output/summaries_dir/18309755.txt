in this paper we investigate the application of non - local graph entropy to evolving and dynamical graphs . the measure is based upon the notion of markov diffusion on a graph , and relies on the entropy applied to trajectories originating at a specific node . in particular , we study the model of reinforcement - decay graph dynamics , which leads to scale free graphs . we find that the node entropy characterizes the structure of the network in the two parameter phase - space describing the dynamical evolution of the weighted graph . we then apply an adapted version of the entropy measure to purely memristive circuits . we provide evidence that meanwhile in the case of dc voltage the entropy based on the forward probability is enough to characterize the graph properties , in the case of ac voltage generators one needs to consider both forward and backward based transition probabilities . we provide also evidence that the entropy highlights the self - organizing properties of memristive circuits , which re - organizes itself to satisfy the symmetries of the underlying graph .
