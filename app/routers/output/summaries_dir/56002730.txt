we report on the investigation of a superconducting anharmonic multi - level circuit that is coupled to a harmonic readout resonator . we observe multi - photon transitions via virtual energy levels of our system up to the fifth excited state . the back - action of these higher - order excitations on our readout device is analyzed quantitatively and demonstrated to be in accordance with theoretical expectation . by applying a strong microwave drive we achieve multi - photon dressing within our anharmonic circuit which is dynamically coupled by a weak probe tone . the emerging higher - order rabi sidebands and associated autler - townes splittings involving up to five levels of the investigated anharmonic circuit are observed . experimental results are in good agreement with master equation simulations .
