the scaling of the optimal cooling power of a reciprocating quantum refrigerator is sought as a function of the cold bath temperature as $ t_c \to 0$. the working medium consists of noninteracting particles in a harmonic potential . two closed - form solutions of the refrigeration cycle are analyzed , and compared to a numerical optimization scheme , focusing on cooling toward zero temperature . the optimal cycle is characterized by linear relations between the heat extracted from the cold bath , the energy level spacing of the working medium and the temperature . the scaling of the optimal cooling rate is found to be proportional to $ t_c^{3/2}$ giving a dynamical interpretation to the third law of thermodynamics .
