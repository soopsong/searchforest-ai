we prove the convergence , in the small mass limit , of statistically invariant states for a class of semi - linear damped wave equations , perturbed by an additive gaussian noise , both with lipschitz - continuous and with polynomial non - linearities . in particular , we prove that the first marginals of any sequence of invariant measures for the stochastic wave equation converge in a suitable wasserstein metric to the unique invariant measure of the limiting stochastic semi - linear parabolic equation obtained in the smoluchowski - kramers approximation . the wasserstein metric is associated to a suitable distance on the space of square integrable functions , that is chosen in such a way that the dynamics of the limiting stochastic parabolic equation is contractive with respect to such a wasserstein metric . this implies that the limiting result is a consequence of the validity of a generalized smoluchowski - kramers limit at fixed times . the proof of such a generalized limit requires new delicate bounds for the solutions of the stochastic wave equation , that must be uniform with respect to the size of the mass .
