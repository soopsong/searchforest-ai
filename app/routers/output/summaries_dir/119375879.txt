understanding the distribution of quantum entanglement over many parties is a fundamental challenge of quantum physics and is of practical relevance for several applications in the field of quantum information . here we use methods from quantum metrology to microscopically characterize the entanglement structure of multimode continuous - variable states in all possible multi - partitions and in all reduced distributions . from experimentally measured covariance matrices of gaussian states with 2 , 3 , and 4 photonic modes with controllable losses , we extract the metrological sensitivity as well as an upper separability bound for each partition . an entanglement witness is constructed by comparing the two quantities . our analysis demonstrates the usefulness of these methods for continuous - variable systems and provides a detailed geometric understanding of the robustness of cluster - state entanglement under photon losses .
