we study the physical properties of the persistent charged current in a metal ring on a noncommutative phase space , and temperature dependence of the noncommutative corrections are also analyzed . we find that the coordinate noncommutativity only affects the total magnitude of the current , and it is difficult to observe it . in contrast , the momentum noncommutativity can violate symmetry property of the current , and this violation of symmetry holds at a finite temperature . based on this violation effect , we introduce an asymmetry observable to measure the momentum noncommutativity .
