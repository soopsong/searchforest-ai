we propose to test the theory of continuous spontaneous localization ( csl ) in an all - optical time - domain talbot - lau interferometer for clusters with masses exceeding 1000000 amu . by assessing the relevant environmental decoherence mechanisms , as well as the growing size of the particles relative to the grating fringes , we argue that it will be feasible to test the quantum superposition principle in a mass range excluded by recent estimates of the csl effect .
