recent experiments on quantum behavior in microfabricated solid - state systems suggest tantalizing connections to quantum optics . several of these experiments address the prototypical problem of cavity quantum electrodynamics : a two - level system coupled to a quantum harmonic oscillator . such devices may allow the exploration of parameter regimes outside the near - resonance and weak - coupling assumptions of the ubiquitous rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , necessitating other theoretical approaches . one such approach is an adiabatic approximation in the limit that the oscillator frequency is much larger than the characteristic frequency of the two - level system . a derivation of the approximation is presented and the time evolution of the two - level - system occupation probability is calculated using both thermal- and coherent - state initial conditions for the oscillator . closed - form evaluation of the time evolution in the weak - coupling limit provides insight into the differences between the thermal- and coherent - state models . finally , potential experimental observations in solid - state systems , particularly the cooper - pair box -- nanomechanical resonator system , are discussed and found to be promising .
