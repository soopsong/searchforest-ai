this work recollects a non - universal set of quantum gates described by higher - dimensional spin groups . they are also directly related with matchgates in theory of quantum computations and complexity . various processes of quantum state distribution along a chain such as perfect state transfer and different types of quantum walks can be effectively modeled on classical computer using such approach .
