quantum phenomena of interest in connection with applications to computation and communication often involve generating specific transfers between eigenstates , and their linear superpositions . for some quantum systems , such as spin systems , the quantum evolution equation ( the schroÌˆdinger equation ) is finite - dimensional and old results on controllability of systems defined on on lie groups and quotient spaces provide most of what is needed insofar as controllability of non - dissipative systems is concerned . however , in an infinite - dimensional setting , controlling the evolution of quantum systems often presents difficulties , both conceptual and technical . in this paper we present a systematic approach to a class of such problems for which it is possible to avoid some of the technical issues . in particular , we analyze controllability for infinite - dimensional bilinear systems under assumptions that make controllability possible using trajectories lying in a nested family of pre - defined subspaces . this result , which we call the finite controllability theorem , provides a set of sufficient conditions for controllability in an infinite - dimensional setting . we consider specific physical systems that are of interest for quantum computing , and provide insights into the types of quantum operations ( gates ) that may be developed .
