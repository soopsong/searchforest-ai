behavioral economics changed the way we think about market participants and revolutionized policy - making by introducing the concept of choice architecture . however , even though effective on the level of a population , interventions from behavioral economics , nudges , are often characterized by weak generalisation as they struggle on the level of individuals . recent developments in data science , artificial intelligence ( ai ) and machine learning ( ml ) have shown ability to alleviate some of the problems of weak generalisation by providing tools and methods that result in models with stronger predictive power . this paper aims to describe how ml and ai can work with behavioral economics to support and augment decision - making and inform policy decisions by designing personalized interventions , assuming that enough personalized traits and psychological variables can be sampled .
