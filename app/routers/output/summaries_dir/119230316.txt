we propose an optical dipole trap for cold neutral atoms based on the electric field produced from the evanescent fields in a hollow rectangular slot cut through an optical nanofibre . in particular , we discuss the trap performance in relation to laser - cooled rubidium atoms and show that a far off - resonance , blue - detuned field combined with the attractive surface - atom interaction potential from the dielectric material forms a stable trapping configuration . with the addition of a red - detuned field , we demonstrate how three dimensional confinement of the atoms at a distance of 140 - 200 nm from the fibre surface within the slot can be accomplished . this scheme facilitates optical coupling between the atoms and the nanofibre that could be exploited for quantum communication schemes using ensembles of laser - cooled atoms .
