the ability to initialize quantum registers in pure states lies at the core of many applications of quantum technologies , from sensing to quantum information processing and computation . in this paper , we tackle the problem of increasing the polarization bias of an ensemble of two - level register spins by means of joint coherent manipulations , involving a second ensemble of ancillary spins and energy dissipation into an external heat bath . we formulate this spin refrigeration protocol , akin to algorithmic cooling , in the general language of quantum feedback control , and identify the relevant thermodynamic variables involved . our analysis is two - fold : on the one hand , we assess the optimality of the protocol by means of suitable figures of merit , accounting for both its work cost and effectiveness ; on the other hand , we characterise the nature of correlations built up between the register and the ancilla . in particular , we observe that neither the amount of classical correlations nor the quantum entanglement seem to be key ingredients fuelling our spin refrigeration protocol . we report instead that a more general indicator of quantumness beyond entanglement , the so - called quantum discord , is closely related to the cooling performance .
