we study two continuous variable systems ( or two harmonic oscillators ) and investigate their entanglement evolution under the influence of non - markovian thermal environments . the continuous variable systems could be two modes of electromagnetic fields or two nanomechanical oscillators in the quantum domain . we use quantum open system method to derive the non - markovian master equations of the reduced density matrix for two different but related models of the continuous variable systems . the two models both consist of two interacting harmonic oscillators . in model a , each of the two oscillators is coupled to its own independent thermal reservoir , while in model b the two oscillators are coupled to a common reservoir . to quantify the degrees of entanglement for the bipartite continuous variable systems in gaussian states , logarithmic negativity is used . we find that the dynamics of the quantum entanglement is sensitive to the initial states , the oscillator - oscillator interaction , the oscillator - environment interaction and the coupling to a common bath or to different , independent baths .
