in 1935 , einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) considered two particles in an entangled state of motion to illustrate why they questioned the completeness of quantum theory . in the past decades , microscopic systems with entanglement in various degrees of freedom have successfully been generated , representing compelling evidence to support the completeness of quantum theory . today , the generation of an epr - entangled state of motion of two massive objects of up to the kilogram - scale seems feasible with state - of - the - art technology . recently , the generation and verification of epr - entangled mirror motion in interferometric gravitational wave detectors was proposed , with the aim of testing quantum theory in the regime of macroscopic objects , and to make available nonclassical probe systems for future tests of modified quantum theories that include ( non - relativistic ) gravity . the work presented here builds on these earlier results and proposes a specific michelson interferometer that includes two high - quality laser mirrors of about 0.1 kg mass each . the mirrors are individually suspended as pendula and located close to each other , and cooled to about 4 k. the physical concepts for the generation of the epr - entangled centre of mass motion of these two mirrors are described . apart from a test of quantum mechanics in the macroscopic world , the setup is envisioned to test predictions of yet - to - be - elaborated modified quantum theories that include gravitational effects .
