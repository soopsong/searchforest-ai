we report the realization of a fiber coupled polarization entangled photon - pair source at 1310 nm based on a birefringent titanium in - diffused waveguide integrated on periodically poled lithium niobate . by taking advantage of a dedicated and high - performance setup , we characterized the quantum properties of the pairs by measuring two - photon interference in both hong - ou - mandel and standard bell inequality configurations . we obtained , for the two sets of measurements , interference net visibilities reaching nearly 100 % , which represent important and competitive results compared to similar waveguide - based configurations already reported . these results prove the relevance of our approach as an enabling technology for long - distance quantum communication .
