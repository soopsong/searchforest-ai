this paper presents a survey of some new applications of algebraic riccati equations . in particular , the paper surveys some recent results on the use of algebraic riccati equations in testing whether a system is negative imaginary and in synthesizing state feedback controllers which make the closed loop system negative imaginary . the paper also surveys the use of riccati equation methods in the control of quantum linear systems including coherent $ h^\infty$ control .
