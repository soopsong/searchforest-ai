we develop a new approach for controllable single - photon transport between two remote one - dimensional coupled - cavity arrays , used as quantum registers , mediated by an additional one - dimensional coupled - cavity array , acting as a quantum channel . a single two - level atom located inside one cavity of the intermediate channel is used to control the long - range coherent quantum coupling between two remote registers , thereby functioning as a quantum switch . with a time - independent perturbative treatment , we find that the leakage of quantum information can in principle be made arbitrarily small . furthermore , our method can be extended to realize a quantum router in multi - register quantum networks , where single - photons can be either stored in one of the registers or transported to another on demand . these results are confirmed by numerical simulations .
