white - light interferometry is one of today 's most precise tools for determining optical material properties . achievable precision and accuracy are typically limited by systematic errors due to a high number of interdependent data fitting parameters . here , we introduce spectrally - resolved quantum white - light interferometry as a novel tool for optical property measurements , notably chromatic dispersion in optical fibres . by exploiting both spectral and photon - number correlations of energy - time entangled photon pairs , the number of fitting parameters is significantly reduced which eliminates systematic errors and leads to an absolute determination of the material parameter . by comparing the quantum method to state - of - the - art approaches , we demonstrate the quantum advantage through 2.4 times better measurement precision , despite involving 62 times less photons . the improved results are due to conceptual advantages enabled by quantum optics which are likely to define new standards in experimental methods for characterising optical materials .
