in composed quantum systems , the presence of local dissipative channels causes loss of coherence and entanglement at a rate that grows with the temperature of the reservoirs . however , here we show that if temperature is artificially added to the system , entanglement decay can be significantly slowed down or even suppressed conditioned on suitable local monitoring of the reservoirs . we propose a scheme to implement the joint reservoir monitoring applicable in different experimental setups like trapped ions , circuit and cavity qed or quantum dots coupled to nanowires and we analyze its general robustness against detection inefficiencies and non - zero temperature of the natural reservoir .
