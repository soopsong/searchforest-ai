atomic ensembles are effective memory nodes for quantum communication network due to the long coherence time and the collective enhancement effect for the nonlinear interaction between an ensemble and a photon . here we investigate the possibility of achieving the entanglement distillation for nonlocal atomic ensembles by the input - output process of a single photon as a result of cavity quantum electrodynamics . we give an optimal entanglement concentration protocol ( ecp ) for two - atomic - ensemble systems in a partially entangled pure state with known parameters and an efficient ecp for the systems in an unknown partially entangled pure state with a nondestructive parity - check detector ( pcd ) . for the systems in a mixed entangled state , we introduce an entanglement purification protocol with pcds . these entanglement distillation protocols have high fidelity and efficiency with current experimental techniques , and they are useful for quantum communication network with atomic - ensemble memories .
