quantum boltzmann machine extends the classical boltzmann machine learning to the quantum regime , which makes its power to simulate the quantum states beyond the classical probability distributions . we develop the bfgs algorithm to study the corresponding optimization problem in quantum boltzmann machine , especially focus on the target states being a family of states with parameters . as an typical example , we study the target states being the real symmetric two - qubit pure states , and we find two obvious features shown in the numerical results on the minimal quantum relative entropy : first , the minimal quantum relative entropy in the first and the third quadrants is zero ; second , the minimal quantum relative entropy is symmetric with the axes $ y = x$ and $ y=-x$ even with one qubit hidden layer . then we theoretically prove these two features from the geometric viewpoint and the symmetry analysis . our studies show that the traditional physical tools can be used to help us to understand some interesting results from quantum boltzmann machine learning .
