system identification is an integrant part of control theory and plays an increasing role in quantum engineering . in the quantum set - up , system identification is usually equated to process tomography , i.e. estimating a channel by probing it repeatedly with different input states . however for quantum dynamical systems like quantum markov processes , it is more natural to consider the estimation based on continuous measurements of the output , with a given input which may be stationary . we address this problem using asymptotic statistics tools , for the specific example of estimating the rabi frequency of an atom maser . we compute the fisher information of different measurement processes as well as the quantum fisher information of the atom maser , and establish the local asymptotic normality of these statistical models . the statistical notions can be expressed in terms of spectral properties of certain deformed markov generators and the connection to large deviations is briefly discussed .
