we study communication between an inertial observer and one of two causally - disconnected counter accelerating observers . we will restrict the quantum channel considering inertial - to - accelerated bipartite classical and quantum communication over different sets of unruh modes ( single - rail or dual - rail encoding ) . we find that the coherent information ( and therefore , the amount of entanglement that can be generated via state merging protocol ) in this strongly restricted channel presents some interesting monogamy properties between the inertial and only one of the accelerated observers if we take a fixed choice of the unruh mode used in the channel . the optimization of the controllable parameters is also studied and we find that they deviate from the values usually employed in the literature .
