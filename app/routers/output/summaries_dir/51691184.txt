we study , in the paradigm of open quantum systems , the entanglement dynamics of two uniformly accelerated atoms with the same acceleration perpendicular to the separation . the two - atom system is treated as an open system coupled with a bath of fluctuating massless scalar fields in the minkowski vacuum , and the master equation that governs its evolution is derived . it has been found that , for accelerated atoms with a nonvanishing separation , entanglement sudden death is a general feature when the initial state is entangled , while for those in a separable initial state , entanglement sudden birth only happens for atoms with an appropriate interatomic separation and sufficiently small acceleration . remarkably , accelerated atoms can get entangled in certain circumstances while the inertial ones in the minkowski vacuum can not . a comparison between the results of accelerated atoms and those of static ones in a thermal bath shows that , uniformly accelerated atoms exhibit distinct features from those immersed in a thermal bath at the unruh temperature in terms of entanglement dynamics .
