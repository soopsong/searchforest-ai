we prove that gaussian thermal input states minimize the output von neumann entropy of the one - mode gaussian quantum - limited attenuator for fixed input entropy . the gaussian quantum - limited attenuator models the attenuation of an electromagnetic signal in the quantum regime . the shannon entropy of an attenuated real - valued classical signal is a simple function of the entropy of the original signal . a striking consequence of energy quantization is that the output von neumann entropy of the quantum - limited attenuator is no more a function of the input entropy alone . the proof starts from the majorization result of de palma et al . , ieee trans . inf . theory 62 , 2895 ( 2016 ) , and is based on a new isoperimetric inequality . our result implies that geometric input probability distributions minimize the output shannon entropy of the thinning for fixed input entropy . moreover , our result opens the way to the multimode generalization , that permits to determine both the triple trade - off region of the gaussian quantum - limited attenuator and the classical capacity region of the gaussian degraded quantum broadcast channel .
