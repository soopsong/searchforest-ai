we compare two different approaches to the control of the dynamics of a continuously monitored open quantum system . the first is markovian feedback as introduced in quantum optics by wiseman and milburn [ phys . rev . lett . { \bf 70 } , 548 ( 1993 ) ] . the second is feedback based on an estimate of the system state , developed recently by doherty { \em et al . } [ phys . rev . a { \bf 62 } , 012105 ( 2000 ) ] . here we choose to call it , for brevity , { \em bayesian feedback } . for systems with nonlinear dynamics , we expect these two methods of feedback control to give markedly different results . the simplest possible nonlinear system is a driven and damped two - level atom , so we choose this as our model system . the monitoring is taken to be homodyne detection of the atomic fluorescence , and the control is by modulating the driving . the aim of the feedback in both cases is to stabilize the internal state of the atom as close as possible to an arbitrarily chosen pure state , in the presence of inefficient detection and other forms of decoherence . our results ( obtain without recourse to stochastic simulations ) prove that bayesian feedback is never inferior , and is usually superior , to markovian feedback . however it would be far more difficult to implement than markovian feedback and it loses its superiority when obvious simplifying approximations are made . it is thus not clear which form of feedback would be better in the face of inevitable experimental imperfections .
