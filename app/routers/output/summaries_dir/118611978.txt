we consider the extraction of shared secret key from correlations that are generated by either a classical or quantum source . in the classical setting , two honest parties ( alice and bob ) use public discussion and local randomness to distill secret key from some distribution $ p_{xyz}$ that is shared with an unwanted eavesdropper ( eve ) . in the quantum settings , the correlations $ p_{xyz}$ are delivered to the parties as either an \textit{incoherent } mixture of orthogonal quantum states or as \textit{coherent } superposition of such states ; in both cases , alice and bob use public discussion and local quantum operations to distill secret key . while the power of quantum mechanics increases alice and bob 's ability to generate shared randomness , it also equips eve with a greater arsenal of eavesdropping attacks . therefore , it is not obvious who gains the greatest advantage for distilling secret key when replacing a classical source with a quantum one . in this paper we first demonstrate that the classical key rate is equivalent to the quantum key rate when the correlations are generated incoherently in the quantum setting . for coherent sources , we next show that the rates are incomparable , and in fact , their difference can be arbitrarily large in either direction . however , we identify a large class of non - trivial distributions $ p_{xyz}$ that possess the following properties : ( i ) eve 's advantage is always greater in the quantum source than in its classical counterpart , and ( ii ) for the quantum entanglement shared between alice and bob in the coherent source , the so - called entanglement cost / squashed entanglement / relative entropy of entanglement can all be computed . with property ( ii ) , we thus present a rare instance in which the various entropic entanglement measures of a quantum state can be explicitly calculated .
