it is shown how to systematically construct the $ xx$ quantum spin chains with nearest - neighbor interactions that allow perfect state transfer ( pst ) . sets of orthogonal polynomials ( ops ) are in correspondence with such systems . the key observation is that for any admissible one - excitation energy spectrum , the weight function of the associated ops is uniquely prescribed . this entails the complete characterization of these pst models with the mirror symmetry property arising as a corollary . a simple and efficient algorithm to obtain the corresponding hamiltonians is presented . a new model connected to a special case of the symmetric $ q$-racah polynomials is offered . it is also explained how additional models with pst can be derived from a parent system by removing energy levels from the one - excitation spectrum of the latter . this is achieved through christoffel transformations and is also completely constructive in regards to the hamiltonians .
