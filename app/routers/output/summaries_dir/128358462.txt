the logarithmic negativity of a bipartite quantum state is a widely employed entanglement measure in quantum information theory , due to the fact that it is easy to compute and serves as an upper bound on distillable entanglement . more recently , the $ \kappa$-entanglement of a bipartite state was shown to be the first entanglement measure that is both easily computable and operationally meaningful , being equal to the exact entanglement cost of a bipartite quantum state when the free operations are those that completely preserve the positivity of the partial transpose . in this paper , we provide a non - trivial link between these two entanglement measures , by showing that they are the extremes of an ordered family of $ \alpha$-logarithmic negativity entanglement measures , each of which is identified by a parameter $ \alpha\in\left [ 1,\infty\right ] $ . in this family , the original logarithmic negativity is recovered as the smallest with $ \alpha=1 $ , and the $ \kappa$-entanglement is recovered as the largest with $ \alpha=\infty$. we prove that the $ \alpha $ -logarithmic negativity satisfies the following properties : full entanglement monotone , normalization , faithfulness , and subadditivity . we also prove that it is neither convex nor monogamous . finally , we define the $ \alpha$-logarithmic negativity of a quantum channel as a generalization of the notion for quantum states , and we show how to generalize many of the concepts to arbitrary resource theories .
