we propose a quantum optics experiment where a single two - mode gaussian entangled state is used for realizing the paradigm of an amendable gaussian channel recently presented in phys . rev . a , \textbf{87 } , 062307 ( 2013 ) . depending on the choice of the experimental parameters the entanglement of the probe state is preserved or not and the relative map belongs or not to the class of entanglement breaking channels . the scheme has been optimized to be as simple as possible : it requires only a single active non - linear operation followed by four passive beam - splitters . the effects of losses , detection inefficiencies and statistical errors are also taken into account , proving the feasibility of the experiment with current realistic resources .
