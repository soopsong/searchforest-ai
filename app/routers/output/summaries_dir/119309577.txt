among various definitions of quantum correlations , quantum discord has attracted considerable attention . to find analytical expression of quantum discord is an intractable task . exact results are known only for very special states , namely , two - qubit x - shaped states . we present in this paper a geometric viewpoint , from which two - qubit quantum discord can be described clearly . the known results about x state discord are restated in the directly perceivable geometric language . as a consequence , the dynamics of classical correlations and quantum discord for an x state in the presence of decoherence is endowed with geometric interpretation . more importantly , we extend the geometric method to the case of more general states , for which numerical as well as analytica results about quantum discord have not been found yet . based on the support of numerical computations , some conjectures are proposed to help us establish geometric picture . we find that the geometric picture for these states has intimate relationship with that for x states . thereby in some cases analytical expressions of classical correlations and quantum discord can be obtained .
