monogamy and polygamy relations characterize the distributions of entanglement in multipartite systems . we provide classes of monogamy and polygamy inequalities of multiqubit entanglement in terms of concurrence , entanglement of formation , negativity , tsallis-$q$ entanglement and r\'{e}nyi-$\alpha$ entanglement , respectively . we show that these inequalities are tighter than the existing ones for some classes of quantum states .
