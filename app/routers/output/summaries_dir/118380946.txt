we introduce hermite polynomial excitation squeezed vacuum ( sv ) h_{n}(o)s(r)|0 > with o = u a+v a^{{+ } } . we investigate analytically the nonclassical properties according to mandel 's q parameter , second correlation function , squeezing effect and the negativity of wigner function ( wf ) . it is found that all these nonclassicalities can be enhanced by h_{n}(o)operation and adjustable parameters u and v. in particular , the optimal negative volume delta_{opt}of wf can be achieved by modulating u and v for n>=2,while delta is kept unchanged for n=1 . furthermore , the decoherence effect of phase - sensitive enviornment on this state is examined . it is shown that delta with bigger ndiminishes more quickly than that with lower n , which indicates that single - photon subtraction sv presents more roboustness . parameter mof reservoirs can be effectively used to improve the nonclassicality .
