based on the quantum renormalization group , we derive the bulk geometry that emerges in the holographic dual of the fermionic u(n ) vector model at a nonzero charge density . the obstruction that prohibits the metallic state from being smoothly deformable to the direct product state under the renormalization group flow gives rise to a horizon at a finite radial coordinate in the bulk . the region outside the horizon is described by the lifshitz geometry with a higher - spin hair determined by microscopic details of the boundary theory . on the other hand , the interior of the horizon is not described by any riemannian manifold , as it exhibits an algebraic non - locality . the non - local structure inside the horizon carries the information on the shape of the filled fermi sea .
