experimental free - will or measurement independence is one of the crucial assumptions in derivation of any nonlocal theorem . any nonlocal correlation obtained in quantum world can have a local deterministic explanation if there is no experimental free - will in choosing the measurement settings . recently , in [ phys . rev . lett . { \bf105 } , 250404 ( 2010 ) ] it has been shown that to obtain a local deterministic description for singlet state correlation one does not need to give up measurement independence completely , but a partial measurement dependence suffices . in three party scenario considering ghz correlation one can exhibit absolute contradiction between quantum theory and local realism . in this paper we show that such correlation also has local deterministic description if measurement independence is given up , even if not completely . we provide a local deterministic model for equatorial von neumann measurements on tripartite ghz state by sacrificing measurement independence partially .
