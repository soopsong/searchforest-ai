we study the quantum zeno effect ( qze ) and quantum anti - zeno effect ( qaze ) of the multimode quantum rabi model(mqrm ) . we derive an analytic expression for the decay rate of the survival probability where cavity modes are initially prepared as thermal equilibrium states . a crossover from qze to qaze is observed due to the energy backflow induced by high frequency cavity modes . in addition , we apply a numerically exact method based on the thermofield dynamics(tfd ) theory and the matrix product states(mps ) to study the effect of squeezing of the cavity modes on the qze of the mqrm . the influence of the squeezing angle , squeezing strength and temperature on the decay rate of the survival probability are discussed .
