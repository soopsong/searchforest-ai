the notion of weak - degradability of quantum channels is introduced by generalizing the degradability definition given by devetak and shor . exploiting the unitary equivalence with beam - splitter / amplifier channels we then prove that a large class of one - mode bosonic gaussian channels are either weakly degradable or anti - degradable . in the latter case this implies that their quantum capacity q is null . in the former case instead , this allows us to establish the additivity of the coherent information for those maps which admit unitary representation with single - mode pure environment .
