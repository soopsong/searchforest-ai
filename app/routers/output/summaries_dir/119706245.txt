noisy dynamical models are employed to describe a wide range of phenomena . since exact modeling of these phenomena requires access to their microscopic dynamics , whose time scales are typically much shorter than the observable time scales , there is often need to resort to effective mathematical models such as stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) . in particular , here we consider effective sdes describing the behavior of systems in the limits when natural time scales became very small . in the presence of multiplicative noise ( i.e. , noise whose intensity depends upon the system 's state ) , an additional drift term , called noise - induced drift , appears . the nature of this noise - induced drift has been recently the subject of a growing number of theoretical and experimental studies . here , we provide an extensive review of the state of the art in this field . after an introduction , we discuss a minimal model of how multiplicative noise affects the evolution of a system . next , we consider several case studies with a focus on recent experiments : brownian motion of a microscopic particle in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath in the presence of a diffusion gradient , and the limiting behavior of a system driven by a colored noise modulated by a multiplicative feedback . this allows us to present the experimental results , as well as mathematical methods and numerical techniques that can be employed to study a wide range of systems . at the end we give an application - oriented overview of future projects involving noise - induced drifts , including both theory and experiment .
