quantum teleportation [ 1 ] is a quintessential prerequisite of many quantum information processing protocols [ 2 - 4 ] . by using quantum teleportation , one can circumvent the no - cloning theorem [ 5 ] and faithfully transfer unknown quantum states to a party whose location is even unknown over arbitrary distances . ever since the first experimental demonstrations of quantum teleportation of independent qubits [ 6 ] and of squeezed states [ 7 ] , researchers have progressively extended the communication distance in teleportation , usually without active feed - forward of the classical bell - state measurement result which is an essential ingredient in future applications such as communication between quantum computers . here we report the first long - distance quantum teleportation experiment with active feed - forward in real time . the experiment employed two optical links , quantum and classical , over 143 km free space between the two canary islands of la palma and tenerife . to achieve this , the experiment had to employ novel techniques such as a frequency - uncorrelated polarization - entangled photon pair source , ultra - low - noise single - photon detectors , and entanglement - assisted clock synchronization . the average teleported state fidelity was well beyond the classical limit of 2/3 . furthermore , we confirmed the quality of the quantum teleportation procedure ( without feed - forward ) by complete quantum process tomography . our experiment confirms the maturity and applicability of the involved technologies in real - world scenarios , and is a milestone towards future satellite - based quantum teleportation .
