we present a general formalism describing a propagation of an arbitrary multiparticle wave packet in a one - dimensional multimode chiral channel coupled to an ensemble of emitters which are distributed at arbitrary positions . the formalism is based on a direct and exact resummation of diagrammatic series for the multiparticle scattering matrix . it is complimentary to the bethe ansatz and to approaches based on equations of motion , and it reveals a simple and transparent structure of scattering states . in particular , we demonstrate how this formalism works on various examples , including scattering of one- and two - photon states off two- and three - level emitters , off an array of emitters as well as scattering of coherent light . we argue that this formalism can be constructively used for study of scattering of an arbitrary initial photonic state off emitters with arbitrary degree of complexity .
