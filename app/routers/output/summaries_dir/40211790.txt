a novel scheme for quantum communication having substantial applications in practical life is designed and analyzed . specifically , we have proposed a hierarchical counterpart of the joint remote state preparation ( jrsp ) protocol , where two senders can jointly and remotely prepare a quantum state . one sender has the information regarding amplitude , while the other one has the phase information of a quantum state to be jointly prepared at the receiver 's port . however , there exists a hierarchy among the receivers , as far as powers to reconstruct the quantum state is concerned . a 5-qubit cluster state has been used here to perform the task . further , it is established that the proposed scheme for hierarchical jrsp ( hjrsp ) is of enormous practical importance in critical situations involving defense and other sectors , where it is essential to ensure that an important decision / order that can severely affect a society or an organization is not taken by a single person , and once the order is issued all the receivers do n't possess an equal right to implement it . further , the effect of different noise models ( e.g. , amplitude damping ( ad ) , phase damping ( pd ) , collective noise and pauli noise models ) on the hjrsp protocol proposed here is investigated . it is found that in ad and pd noise models a higher power agent can reconstruct the quantum state to be remotely prepared with higher fidelity than that done by the lower power agent(s ) . in contrast , the opposite may happen in the presence of collective noise models . we have also proposed a scheme for probabilistic hjrsp using a non - maximally entangled 5-qubit cluster state .
