recently , sun et al . [ quant inf proc doi : 10.1007 / s11128 - 013 - 0569-x ] presented an efficient multi - party quantum key agreement ( qka ) protocol by employing single particles and unitary operations . the aim of this protocol is to fairly and securely negotiate a secret session key among $ n$ parties with a high qubit efficiency . in addition , the authors claimed that no participant can learn anything more than his / her prescribed output in this protocol , i.e. , the sub - secret keys of the participants can be kept secret during the protocol . however , here we points out that the sub - secret of a participant in sun et al . 's protocol can be eavesdropped by the two participants next to him / her . in addition , a certain number of dishonest participants can fully determine the final shared key in this protocol . finally , we discuss the factors that should be considered when designing a really fair and secure qka protocol .
