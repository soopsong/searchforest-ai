the subsystem compatibility problem , which concerns the question of whether a set of subsystem states are compatible with a state of the entire system , has received much study . here we attack the problem from a new angle , utilising the ideas of convexity that have been successfully employed against the separability problem . analogously to an entanglement witness , we introduce the idea of a compatibility witness , and prove a number of properties about these objects . we show that the subsystem compatibility problem can be solved numerically and efficiently using semidefinite programming , and that the numerical results from this solution can be used to extract exact analytic results , an idea which we use to disprove a conjecture about the subsystem problem made by butterley et al . [ found . phys . 36 83 ( 2006 ) ] . finally , we consider how the ideas can be used to tackle some important variants of the compatibility problem ; in particular , the case of identical particles ( known as n - representability in the case of fermions ) is considered .
