we present a scheme for multipartite entanglement purification of quantum systems in a greenberger - horne - zeilinger state with quantum nondemolition detectors ( qnds ) . this scheme does not require the controlled - not gates which can not be implemented perfectly with linear optical elements at present , but qnds based on cross - kerr nonlinearities . it works with two steps , i.e. , the bit - flipping error correction and the phase - flipping error correction . these two steps can be iterated perfectly with parity checks and simple single - photon measurements . this scheme does not require the parties to possess sophisticated single photon detectors . these features maybe make this scheme more efficient and feasible than others in practical applications .
