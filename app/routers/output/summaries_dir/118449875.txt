we present a formulation in a curved background of noncommutative mechanics , where the object of noncommutativity $ \theta^{\mu\nu}$ is considered as an independent quantity having a canonical conjugate momentum . we introduced a noncommutative first - order action in d=10 curved spacetime and the covariant equations of motions were computed . this model , invariant under diffeomorphism , generalizes recent relativistic results .
