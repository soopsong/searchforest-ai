it is a well - known fact that the optimal povm for quantum state tomography is the symmetric , informationally complete , positive operator valued measure ( sic - povm ) . we investigate the same problem only in the case when there are some a priori information about the state , specifically when some parameters are known . in this paper we mainly focus on solving a 3-dimensional optimization problem , which gives us a non - trivial example for the so - called conditional sic- povms , a straightforward generalization of the concept of sic - povms . we also present other special cases to show further applications of the proposed numerical methods and to illustrate the complexity of this topic .
