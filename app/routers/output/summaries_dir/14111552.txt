two different experimental techniques for preparation and analyzing superpositions of the gaussian and laguerre - gassian modes are presented . this is done exploiting an interferometric method on the one hand and using computer generated holograms on the other hand . it is shown that by shifting the hologram with respect to an incoming gaussian beam different superpositions of the gaussian and the laguerre - gaussian beam can be produced . an analytical expression between the relative phase and the amplitudes of the modes and the displacement of the hologram is given . the application of such orbital angular momenta superpositions in quantum experiments such as quantum cryptography is discussed .
