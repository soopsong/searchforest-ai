we report numerical evidence of hawking emission of bogoliubov phonons from a sonic horizon in a flowing one - dimensional atomic bose - einstein condensate . the presence of hawking radiation is revealed from peculiar long - range patterns in the density - density correlation function of the gas . quantitative agreement between our fully microscopic calculations and the prediction of analog models is obtained in the hydrodynamic limit . new features are predicted and the robustness of the hawking signal against a finite temperature discussed .
