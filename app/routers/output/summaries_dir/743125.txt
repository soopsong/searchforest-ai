in this paper we improve the layered implementation of arbitrary stabilizer circuits introduced by aaronson and gottesman in { \it phys . rev . a 70(052328 ) } , 2004 . in particular , we reduce their 11-stage computation -h - c - p - c - p - c - h - p - c - p - c- into an 8-stage computation of the form -h - c - cz - p - h - p - cz - c- . we show arguments in support of using -cz- stages over the -c- stages : not only the use of -cz- stages allows a shorter layered expression , but -cz- stages are simpler and appear to be easier to implement compared to the -c- stages . relying on the 8-stage decomposition we develop a two - qubit depth-$(14n-4)$ implementation of stabilizer circuits over the gate library { p , h , cnot } , executable in the lnn architecture , improving best previously known depth-$25n$ circuit , also executable in the lnn architecture . our constructions rely on folding arbitrarily long sequences $ ( $ -p - c-$)^m$ into a 3-stage computation -p - cz - c- , as well as efficient implementation of the -cz- stage circuits .
