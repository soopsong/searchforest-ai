we investigate heat transport in a spin-1/2 heisenberg chain , coupled locally to independent thermal baths of different temperature . the analysis is carried out within the framework of the theory of open systems by means of appropriate quantum master equations . the standard microscopic derivation of the weak - coupling lindblad equation in the secular approximation is considered , and shown to be inadequate for the description of stationary nonequilibrium properties like a nonvanishing energy current . furthermore , we derive an alternative master equation that is capable of describing a stationary energy current and , at the same time , leads to a completely positive dynamical map . this paves the way for efficient numerical investigations of heat transport in larger systems based on monte carlo wave function techniques .
