the implications of the anarchy principle on cp violation in the lepton sector are investigated . a systematic method is introduced to compute the probability density functions for the cp - violating rephasing invariants of the pmns matrix from the haar measure relevant to the anarchy principle . contrary to the ckm matrix which is hierarchical , it is shown that the haar measure , and hence the anarchy principle , are very likely to lead to the observed pmns matrix . predictions on the cp - violating dirac rephasing invariant $ |j_d|$ and majorana rephasing invariant $ |j_1|$ are also obtained . they correspond to $ \langle|j_d|\rangle_\text{haar}=\pi/105\approx0.030 $ and $ \langle|j_1|\rangle_\text{haar}=1/(6\pi)\approx0.053 $ respectively , in agreement with the experimental hint from t2k of $ |j_d^\text{exp}|\approx0.032\pm0.005 $ ( or $ \approx0.033\pm0.003 $ ) for the normal ( or inverted ) hierarchy .
