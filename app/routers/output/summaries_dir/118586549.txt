the coherent control of small quantum system is considered . for a two - level system coupled to an arbitrary bath we consider a pulse of finite duration . we derive the leading and the next - leading order corrections to the evolution operator due to the non - commutation of the pulse and the bath hamiltonian . the conditions are computed that make the leading corrections vanish . the pulse shapes optimized in this way are given for $ \pi$ and $ \frac{\pi}{2}$ pulses .
