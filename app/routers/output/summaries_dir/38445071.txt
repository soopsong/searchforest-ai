resonant excitation of solid state quantum emitters has the potential to deterministically excite a localized exciton while ensuring a maximally coherent emission . in this work , we demonstrate the coherent coupling of an exciton localized in a lithographically positioned , site - controlled semiconductor quantum dot to an external resonant laser field . for strong continuous - wave driving we observe the characteristic mollow triplet and analyze the rabi splitting and sideband widths as a function of driving strength and temperature . the sideband widths increase linearly with temperature and the square of the driving strength , which we explain via coupling of the exciton to longitudinal acoustic phonons . we also find an increase of the rabi splitting with temperature , which indicates a temperature induced delocalization of the excitonic wave function resulting in an increase of the oscillator strength . finally , we demonstrate coherent control of the exciton excited state population via pulsed resonant excitation and observe a damping of the rabi oscillations with increasing pulse area , which is consistent with our exciton - photon coupling model . we believe that our work outlines the possibility to implement fully scalable platforms of solid state quantum emitters . the latter is one of the key prerequisites for more advanced , integrated nanophotonic quantum circuits .
