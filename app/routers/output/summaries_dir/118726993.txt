we propose a new no - go theorem by proving the impossibility of constructing a deterministic quantum circuit that iterates a unitary oracle by calling it only once . different schemes are provided to bypass this result and to approximately realize the iteration . the optimal scheme is also studied . an interesting observation is that for large number of iterations , a trivial strategy like using the identity channel has the optimal performance , and preprocessing , postprocessing , or using resources like entanglement does not help at all . intriguingly , the number of iterations , when being large enough , does not affect the performance of the proposed schemes .
