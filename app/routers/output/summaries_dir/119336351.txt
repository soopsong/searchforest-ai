we present a systematic numerical iteration approach to study the evolution properties of the spin - boson systems , which works well in whole coupling regime . this approach involves the evaluation of a set of coefficients for the formal expansion of the time - dependent schr\"{o}dinger equation $ \vert t\rangle = e^{-i\hat{h}t}\vert t=0\rangle$ by expanding the initial state $ \vert t=0\rangle$ in fock space . the main advantage of this method is that this set of coefficients is unique for the hamiltonian studied , which allows one to calculate the time evolution based on the different initial states . to complement our numerical calculations , the method is applied to the buck - sukumar model . furthermore , we pointed out that , when the ground state energy of the model is unbounded and no ground state exists in a certain parameter space , the unstable time evolution of the physical quantities is the natural results . furthermore , we test the performance of the numerical method to the hamiltonian that use anti - hermitian terms for modeling open quantum systems .
