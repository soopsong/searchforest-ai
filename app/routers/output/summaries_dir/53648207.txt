the nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation is promising as it is robust against certain types of local noises . however , its experimental implementation is challenging due to the need of complex control on multi - level and/or multiple quantum systems . here , we propose to implement it on a two - dimensional square superconducting qubit lattice . in the construction of our geometric quantum gates , we only use the simplest and experimentally accessible control over the qubit states of the involved quantum systems , without introducing any auxiliary state . specifically , our scheme is achieved by parametrically tunable all - resonant interaction , which leads to high - fidelity quantum gates . meanwhile , this simple implementation can be conveniently generalized to a composite scenario , which can further suppress the systematic error during the gate operations . in addition , universal nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates in decoherence - free subspace can also be realized based on the tunable coupling between only two transmon qubits , without consulting to multiple qubits and only using two physical qubits to encode a logical qubit . therefore , our proposal provides a promising way of high - fidelity geometric manipulation for robust solid - state quantum computation .
