quantum systems with a large number of fermionic degrees of freedom are intractable by quantum simulations . in this paper we introduce the concept of a dedicated quantum simulator(dqs ) which is an artificial system of quantum dots whose hamiltonian maps exactly to the original many fermion problem . while the universal quantum simulator ( uqs ) introduced by feynman in 1982 can simulate any quantum mechanical many - body problem , a dqs can only solve a particular many body problem . our concept of the dedicated quantum simulator is not a quantum computer but rather a quantum"analog"device , dedicated to a particular quantum computation . as an example , we consider the system of the $ cuo$ plane in the copper - oxide superconductors and we propose an array of electrostatically confined quantum dots to be used as its dedicated quantum simulator . we show that this dedicated device can be used to image stripe formation as a function of the electron doping using electric force microscopy . we argue that such a dedicated quantum simulator may be easier to realize in the future compared to a general purpose quantum computer .
