a continuous - time quantum walk on a graph $ g$ is given by the unitary matrix $ u(t ) = \exp(-ita)$ , where $ a$ is the hermitian adjacency matrix of $ g$. we say $ g$ has pretty good state transfer between vertices $ a$ and $ b$ if for any $ \epsilon>0 $ , there is a time $ t$ , where the $ ( a , b)$-entry of $ u(t)$ satisfies $ |u(t)_{a , b}| \ge 1-\epsilon$. this notion was introduced by godsil ( 2011 ) . the state transfer is perfect if the above holds for $ \epsilon = 0$. in this work , we study a natural extension of this notion called universal state transfer . here , state transfer exists between every pair of vertices of the graph . we prove the following results about graphs with this stronger property : ( 1 ) graphs with universal state transfer have distinct eigenvalues and flat eigenbasis ( where each eigenvector has entries which are equal in magnitude ) . ( 2 ) the switching automorphism group of a graph with universal state transfer is abelian and its order divides the size of the graph . moreover , if the state transfer is perfect , then the switching automorphism group is cyclic . ( 3 ) there is a family of prime - length cycles with complex weights which has universal pretty good state transfer . this provides a concrete example of an infinite family of graphs with the universal property . ( 4 ) there exists a class of graphs with real symmetric adjacency matrices which has universal pretty good state transfer . in contrast , kay ( 2011 ) proved that no graph with real - valued adjacency matrix can have universal perfect state transfer . we also provide a spectral characterization of universal perfect state transfer graphs that are switching equivalent to circulants .
