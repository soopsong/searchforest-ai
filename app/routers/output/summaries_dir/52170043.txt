usually , the hyperparallel quantum computation can speed up quantum computing , reduce the quantum resource consumed largely , resist to noise , and simplify the storage of quantum information . here , we present the first scheme for the self - error - corrected hyperparallel photonic quantum computation working with both the polarization and the spatial - mode degrees of freedom of photon systems simultaneously . it can prevent bit - flip errors from happening with an imperfect nonlinear interaction in the nearly realistic condition . we give the way to design the universal hyperparallel photonic quantum controlled - not ( cnot ) gate on a two - photon system , resorting to the nonlinear interaction between the circularly polarized photon and the electron spin in the quantum dot in a double - sided microcavity system , by taking the imperfect interaction in the nearly realistic condition into account . its self - error - corrected pattern prevents the bit - flip errors from happening in the hyperparallel quantum cnot gate , guarantees the robust fidelity , and relaxes the requirement for its experiment . meanwhile , this scheme works in a failure - heralded way . also , we generalize this approach to achieve the self - error - corrected hyperparallel quantum cnot$^n$ gate working on a multiple - photon system . these good features make this scheme more useful in the photonic quantum computation and quantum communication in the future .
