our understanding of the physics of biological molecules , such as proteins and dna , is limited because the approximations we usually apply to model inert materials are not in general applicable to soft , chemically inhomogeneous systems . the configurational complexity of biomolecules means the entropic contribution to the free energy is a significant factor in their behaviour , requiring detailed dynamical calculations to fully evaluate . computer simulations capable of taking all interatomic interactions into account are therefore vital . however , even with the best current supercomputing facilities , we are unable to capture enough of the most interesting aspects of their behaviour to properly understand how they work . this limits our ability to design new molecules , to treat diseases , for example . progress in biomolecular simulation depends crucially on increasing the computing power available . faster classical computers are in the pipeline , but these provide only incremental improvements . quantum computing offers the possibility of performing huge numbers of calculations in parallel , when it becomes available . we discuss the current open questions in biomolecular simulation , how these might be addressed using quantum computation and speculate on the future importance of quantum - assisted biomolecular modelling .
