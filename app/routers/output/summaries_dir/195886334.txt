recently the use of noisy intermediate scale quantum ( nisq ) devices for machine learning tasks has been proposed . the propositions often perform poorly due to various restrictions . however , the quantum devices should perform well in sampling tasks . thus , we recall theory of sampling - based approach to machine learning and propose a quantum sampling based classifier . namely , we use randomized feature map approach . we propose a method of quantum sampling based on random quantum circuits with parametrized rotations distribution . we obtain simple to use method with intuitive hyper - parameters that performs at least equally well as top out - of - the - box classical methods . in short we obtain a competitive quantum classifier with crucial component being quantum sampling -- a promising task for quantum supremacy .
