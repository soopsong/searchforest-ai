we study the properties of quantum stabilizer codes that embed a finite - dimensional protected code space in an infinite - dimensional hilbert space . the stabilizer group of such a code is associated with a symplectically integral lattice in the phase space of 2n canonical variables . from the existence of symplectically integral lattices with suitable properties , we infer a lower bound on the quantum capacity of the gaussian quantum channel that matches the one - shot coherent information optimized over gaussian input states .
