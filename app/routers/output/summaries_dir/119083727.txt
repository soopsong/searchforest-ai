we present a quantum information theoretic version of the klein - nishina formula . this formulation singles out the quantity , the a priori visibility , that quantifies the ability to deduce the polarisation property of single photons . the kraus - type structure allows a straightforward generalisation to the multiphoton cases , relevant in the decay of positronium which is utilized e.g. for metabolic pet - imaging ( positron - emission - tomograph ) . predicted by theory but never experimentally proven , the two- or three - photon states should be entangled . we provide an experimentally feasible method to witness entanglement for these processes via mubs ( mutually unbiased bases ) , exploiting bohr 's complementarity . last but not least we present explicit cases exemplifying the interrelation of geometry and entanglement including relations to its potentiality for teleportation schemes or bell inequality violations or in future for detecting cancer in human beings .
