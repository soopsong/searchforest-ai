over the past 20 years , bright sources of entangled photons have led to a renaissance in quantum optical interferometry . optical interferometry has been used to test the foundations of quantum mechanics and implement some of the novel ideas associated with quantum entanglement such as quantum teleportation , quantum cryptography , quantum lithography , quantum computing logic gates , and quantum metrology . in this paper , we focus on the new ways that have been developed to exploit quantum optical entanglement in quantum metrology to beat the shot - noise limit , which can be used , e.g. , in fiber optical gyroscopes and in sensors for biological or chemical targets . we also discuss how this entanglement can be used to beat the rayleigh diffraction limit in imaging systems such as in lidar and optical lithography .
