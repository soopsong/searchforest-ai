future quantum technologies rely heavily on good protection of quantum entanglement against environment - induced decoherence . a recent study showed that an extension of uhrig 's dynamical decoupling ( udd ) sequence can ( in theory ) lock an arbitrary but known two - qubit entangled state to the $ n$th order using a sequence of $ n$ control pulses [ mukhtar et al . , phys . rev . a 81 , 012331 ( 2010 ) ] . by nesting three layers of explicitly constructed udd sequences , here we first consider the protection of unknown two - qubit states as superposition of two known basis states , without making assumptions of the system - environment coupling . it is found that the obtained decoherence suppression can be highly sensitive to the ordering of the three udd layers and can be remarkably effective with the correct ordering . the detailed theoretical results are useful for general understanding of the nature of controlled quantum dynamics under nested udd . as an extension of our three - layer udd , it is finally pointed out that a completely unknown two - qubit state can be protected by nesting four layers of udd sequences . this work indicates that when udd is applicable ( e.g. , when environment has a sharp frequency cut - off and when control pulses can be taken as instantaneous pulses ) , dynamical decoupling using nested udd sequences is a powerful approach for entanglement protection .
