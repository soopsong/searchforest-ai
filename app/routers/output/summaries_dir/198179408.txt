in the ideal quantum zeno effect , repeated quantum projective measurements can protect the coherent dynamics of a quantum system . however , in the weak quantum zeno regime , measurement back - actions can allow the sensing of semi - classical field fluctuations . in this regard , we theoretically show how to combine the controlled manipulation of a quantum two - level system , used as a probe , with a sequence of projective measurements to have direct access to the noise correlation function . we experimentally test the effectiveness of the proposed noise sensing method on a properly engineered bose - einstein condensate of $ ^{87}rb$ atoms realized on an atom chip . we believe that our quantum zeno - based approach can open a new path towards novel quantum sensing devices .
