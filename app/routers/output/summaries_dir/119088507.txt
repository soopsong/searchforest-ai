the strong version of the nonviolent nonlocality proposal of giddings predicts"strong but soft"quantum metric fluctuations near black hole horizons in an attempt to resolve the information paradox . to study observable signatures of this proposal , we numerically solve einstein 's equations modified by these fluctuations and analyze the gravitational wave signal from the inspiral and merger of two black holes . in a model of evolution for such fluctuations , we show that they lead to significant deviations in the observed waveform , even when the black holes are still well separated , and could potentially be observed by aligo .
