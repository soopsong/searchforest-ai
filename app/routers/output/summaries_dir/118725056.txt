quantum optomechanics offers the potential to investigate quantum effects in macroscopic quantum systems in extremely well controlled experiments . in this paper we discuss one such situation , the dynamic stabilization of a mechanical system such as an inverted pendulum . the specific example that we study is a"membrane in the middle"mechanical oscillator coupled to a cavity field via a quadratic optomechanical interaction , with cavity damping the dominant source of dissipation . we show that the mechanical oscillator can be dynamically stabilized by a temporal modulation of the radiation pressure force . we investigate the system both in the classical and quantum regimes highlighting similarities and differences .
