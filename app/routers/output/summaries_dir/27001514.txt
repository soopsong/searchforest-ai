the mechanical properties of light have found widespread use in the manipulation of gas - phase atoms and ions , helping create new states of matter and realize complex quantum interactions . the field of cavity - optomechanics strives to scale this interaction to much larger , even human - sized mechanical objects . going beyond the canonical fabry - perot cavity with a movable mirror , here we explore a new paradigm in which multiple cavity - optomechanical elements are wired together to form optomechanical circuits . using a pair of optomechanical cavities coupled together via a phonon waveguide we demonstrate a tunable delay and filter for microwave - over - optical signal processing . in addition , we realize a tight - binding form of mechanical coupling between distant optomechanical cavities , leading to direct phonon exchange without dissipation in the waveguide . these measurements indicate the feasibility of phonon - routing based information processing in optomechanical crystal circuitry , and further , to the possibility of realizing topological phases of photons and phonons in optomechanical cavity lattices .
