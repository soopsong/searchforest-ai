the readout of semiconductor spin qubits based on spin blockade is fast but suffers from a small charge signal . previous work suggested large benefits from additional charge mapping processes , however uncertainties remain about the underlying mechanisms and achievable fidelity . in this work , we study the single - shot fidelity and limiting mechanisms for two variations of an enhanced latching readout . we achieve average single - shot readout fidelities>99.3 % and>99.86 % for the conventional and enhanced readout respectively , the latter being the highest to date for spin blockade . the signal amplitude is enhanced to a full one - electron signal while preserving the readout speed . furthermore , layout constraints are relaxed because the charge sensor signal is no longer dependent on being aligned with the conventional ( 2 , 0 ) - ( 1 , 1 ) charge dipole . silicon donor - quantum - dot qubits are used for this study , for which the dipole insensitivity substantially relaxes donor placement requirements . one of the readout variations also benefits from a parametric lifetime enhancement by replacing the spin - relaxation process with a charge - metastable one . this provides opportunities to further increase the fidelity . the relaxation mechanisms in the different regimes are investigated . this work demonstrates a readout that is fast , has one - electron signal and results in higher fidelity . it further predicts that going beyond 99.9 % fidelity in a few microseconds of measurement time is within reach .
