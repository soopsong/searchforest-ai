this paper studies quantum limits to dynamical sensors in the presence of decoherence . a modified purification approach is used to obtain tighter quantum detection and estimation error bounds for optical phase sensing and optomechanical force sensing . when optical loss is present , these bounds are found to obey shot - noise scalings for arbitrary quantum states of light under certain realistic conditions , thus ruling out the possibility of asymptotic heisenberg error scalings with respect to the average photon flux under those conditions . the proposed bounds are expected to be approachable using current quantum optics technology .
