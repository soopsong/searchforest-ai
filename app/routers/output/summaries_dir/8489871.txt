characterizing genuine multipartite quantum correlations in quantum physical systems has historically been a challenging problem in quantum information theory . more recently however , the total correlation or multipartite information measure has been helpful in accomplishing this goal , especially with the multipartite symmetric quantum ( msq ) discord [ piani et al . , phys . rev . lett . 100 , 090502 , 2008 ] and the conditional entanglement of multipartite information ( cemi ) [ yang et al . , phys . rev . lett . 101 , 140501 , 2008 ] . here we apply a recent and significant improvement of strong subadditivity of quantum entropy [ fawzi and renner , arxiv:1410.0664 ] in order to develop these quantities further . in particular , we prove that the msq discord is nearly equal to zero if and only if the multipartite state for which it is evaluated is approximately locally recoverable after performing measurements on each of its systems . furthermore , we prove that the cemi is a faithful entanglement measure , i.e. , it vanishes if and only if the multipartite state for which it is evaluated is a fully separable state . along the way we provide an operational interpretation of the msq discord in terms of the partial state distribution protocol , which in turn , as a special case , gives an interpretation for the original discord quantity . finally , we prove an inequality that could potentially improve upon the fawzi - renner inequality in the multipartite context , but it remains an open question to determine whether this is so .
