quantum process tomography is a procedure by which an unknown quantum operation can be fully experimentally characterized . we reinterpret choi 's proof of the fact that any completely positive linear map has a kraus representation [ lin . alg . and app . , 10 , 1975 ] as a method for quantum process tomography . furthermore , the analysis for obtaining the kraus operators are particularly simple in this method .
