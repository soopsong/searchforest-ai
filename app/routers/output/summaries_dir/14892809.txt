we discuss the physical properties of realistic memristive , memcapacitive and meminductive systems . in particular , by employing the well - known theory of response functions and microscopic derivations , we show that resistors , capacitors and inductors with memory emerge naturally in the response of systems - especially those of nanoscale dimensions - subjected to external perturbations . as a consequence , since memristances , memcapacitances , and meminductances are simply response functions , they are not necessarily finite . this means that , unlike what has always been argued in some literature , diverging and non - crossing input - output curves of all these memory elements are physically possible in both quantum and classical regimes . for similar reasons , it is not surprising to find memcapacitances and meminductances that acquire negative values at certain times during dynamics , while the passivity criterion of memristive systems imposes always a non - negative value on the resistance at any given time . we finally show that ideal memristors , namely those whose state depends only on the charge that flows through them ( or on the history of the voltage ) are subject to very strict physical conditions and are unable to protect their memory state against the unavoidable fluctuations , and therefore are susceptible to a stochastic catastrophe . similar considerations apply to ideal memcapacitors and meminductors .
