coherent feedback is a non - measurement based , hence a back - action free , method of control for quantum systems . a typical application of this control scheme is squeezing enhancement , a purely non - classical effect in quantum optics . in this paper we report its first experimental demonstration that well agrees with the theory taking into account time delays and losses in the coherent feedback loop . the results clarify both the benefit and the limitation of coherent feedback control in a practical situation .
