based on a theorem we establish on dynamical decoupling of time - dependent systems , we present a scheme of nested uhrig dynamical decoupling ( nudd ) to protect multi - qubit systems in generic quantum baths to arbitrary decoupling orders , using only single - qubit operations . the number of control pulses in nudd increases polynomially with the decoupling order . for general multi - level systems , this scheme can preserve a set of unitary hermitian system operators which mutually either commute or anti - commute , and hence all operators in the lie algebra generated from this set of operators , generating an effective symmetry group for the system up to a given order of precision . nudd can be implemented with pulses of finite amplitude , up to an error in the second order of the pulse durations .
