cavity quantum electrodynamics describes the fundamental interactions between light and matter , and how they can be controlled by shaping the local environment . for example , optical microcavities allow high - efficiency detection and manipulation of single atoms . in this regime fluctuations of atom number are on the order of the mean number , which can lead to signal fluctuations in excess of the noise on the incident probe field . conversely , we demonstrate that nonlinearities and multi - atom statistics can together serve to suppress the effects of atomic fluctuations when making local density measurements on clouds of cold atoms . we measure atom densities below 1 per cavity mode volume near the photon shot - noise limit . this is in direct contrast to previous experiments where fluctuations in atom number contribute significantly to the noise . atom detection is shown to be fast and efficient , reaching fidelities in excess of 97 % after 10 us and 99.9 % after 30 us .
