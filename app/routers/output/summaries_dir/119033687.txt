we suggest and demonstrate a method to assess entanglement generation schemes based on mixing of gaussian states at a beam splitter ( bs ) . our method is based on the fidelity criterion and represents a tool to analyze the effect of losses and noise before the bs in both symmetric and asymmetric channels with and without thermal effects . more generally , our scheme allows one to pre - assess entanglement resources and to optimize the design of bs - based schemes for the generation of continuous variable entanglement .
