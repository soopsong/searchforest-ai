the current - current correlation function is a useful concept in the theory of electron transport in homogeneous solids . the finite - temperature conductivity tensor as well as anderson 's localization length can be computed entirely from this correlation function . based on the critical behavior of these two physical quantities near the plateau - insulator or plateau - plateau transitions in the integer quantum hall effect , we derive an asymptotic formula for the current - current correlation function , which enables us to make several theoretical predictions about its generic behavior . for the disordered hofstadter model , we employ numerical simulations to map the current - current correlation function , obtain its asymptotic form near a critical point and confirm the theoretical predictions .
