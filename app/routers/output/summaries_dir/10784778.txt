the degree of nonclassicality of states of a field mode is analysed considering both phase - space and distance - type measures of nonclassicality . by working out some general examples , it is shown explicitly that the phase - space measure is rather sensitive to superposition of states , with finite superpositions possessing maximum nonclassical depth ( the highest degree of nonclassicality ) irrespective to the nature of the component states . mixed states are also discussed and examples with nonclassical depth varying between the minimum and the maximum allowed values are exhibited . for pure gaussian states , it is demonstrated that distance - type measures based on the hilbert - schmidt metric are equivalent to the phase - space measure . analyzing some examples , it is shown that distance - type measures are efficient to quantify the degree of nonclassicality of non - gaussian pure states .
