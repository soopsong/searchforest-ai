recent experimental results and proposals towards implementation of quantum teleportation are discussed . it is proved that reliable ( theoretically , 100 % probability of success ) teleportation can not be achieved using the methods applied in recent experiments , i.e. , without quantum systems interacting one with the other . teleportation proposal involving atoms and electro - magnetic cavities are reviewed and the most feasible methods are described . in particular , the language of nonlocal measurements has been applied which has also been used for presenting a method for teleportation of quantum states of systems with continuous variables .
