we demonstrate the implementation of quantum cheque , proposed by roy moulick and panigrahi [ quantum inf . process ( 2016 ) 15 : 2475 ] , using the five - qubit ibm quantum computer . appropriate single qubit , cnot and fredkin gates have been implemented for the realization of the quantum cheque transaction in a quantum networked banking system . quantum state tomography reveals the accuracy of the implementation with comparable results from the theoretical and experimental density matrices .
