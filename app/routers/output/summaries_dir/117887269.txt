the extension of thermodynamics into the quantum regime has received much attention in recent years . a primary objective of current research is to find thermodynamic tasks which can be enhanced by quantum mechanical effects . with this goal in mind , we explore the finite - time dynamics of absorption refrigerators composed of three qubits . the aim of this finite - time cooling is to reach low temperatures as fast as possible and subsequently extract the cold particle to exploit it for information processing purposes . we show that the coherent oscillations inherent to quantum dynamics can be harnessed to reach temperatures that are colder than the steady state in orders of magnitude less time , thereby providing a fast source of low - entropy qubits . this effect demonstrates that quantum thermal machines can surpass classical ones , reminiscent of quantum advantages in other fields , and is applicable to a broad range of technologically important scenarios .
