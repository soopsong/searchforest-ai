we address the question of which quantum states can be inter - converted under the action of a time - dependent hamiltonian . in particular , we consider the problem applied to mixed states , and investigate the difference between pure and mixed - state controllability introduced in previous work . we provide a complete characterization of the eigenvalue spectrum for which the state is controllable under the action of the symplectic group . we also address the problem of which states can be prepared if the dynamical lie group is not sufficiently large to allow the system to be controllable .
