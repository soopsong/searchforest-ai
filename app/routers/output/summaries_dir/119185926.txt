we present an exact analytical solution of the two - photon scattering in a cavity optomechanical system . this is achieved by solving the quantum dynamics of the total system , including the optomechanical cavity and the cavity - field environment , with the laplace transform method . the long - time solution reveals detailed physical processes involved as well as the corresponding resonant photon frequencies . we characterize the photon correlation induced in the scattering process by calculating the two - photon joint spectrum of the long - time state . clear evidence for photon frequency anti - correlation can be observed in the joint spectrum . in addition , we calculate the equal - time second - order correlation function of the cavity photons . the results show that the radiation pressure coupling can induce photon blockade effect , which is strongly modulated by the phonon sideband resonance . in particular , we obtain an explicit expression of optomechanical coupling strength determining these sideband modulation peaks based on the two - photon resonance condition .
