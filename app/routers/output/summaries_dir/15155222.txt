the presented work provides a procedure for optimizing the communication cost of a distributed quantum circuit ( dqc ) in terms of the number of qubit teleportations . because of technology limitations which do not allow large quantum computers to work as a single processing element , distributed quantum computation is an appropriate solution to overcome this difficulty . previous studies have applied ad - hoc solutions to distribute a quantum system for special cases and applications . in this study , a general approach is proposed to optimize the number of teleportations for a dqc consisting of two spatially separated and long - distance quantum subsystems . to this end , different configurations of locations for executing gates whose qubits are in distinct subsystems are considered and for each of these configurations , the proposed algorithm is run to find the minimum number of required teleportations . finally , the configuration which leads to the minimum number of teleportations is reported . the proposed method can be used as an automated procedure to find the configuration with the optimal communication cost for the dqc .
