in this paper we deal with several issues regarding the localization properties of the unruh - dewitt ( udw ) detector model . since its original formulation as a pointlike detector , the udw model has been used to study extensively the physics of quantum fields in presence of accelerations or curved backgrounds . natural extensions of it have tried to take into account the spatial profile of such detectors , but all of them have met a series of problems in their spectral response which render them useless to study some of the most interesting physical scenarios . in this paper we provide a derivation of the smeared udw interaction from qed first principles , then we analyze the spectral response of spatially smeared udw detectors , and discuss the kind of spatial profiles which are useful for the study of relevant cases .
