in this paper we estimate the parameters of the qubit pauli channel using the channel matrix formalism . the main novelty of this work is that we do not assume the directions of the pauli channel to be known , but they are determined through the tomography process , too . the results show that for optimally estimating the contraction parameters and the channel matrix we should have input qubits and measurements in the channel directions . however , for optimally estimating the channel directions , we should use different tomography conditions .
