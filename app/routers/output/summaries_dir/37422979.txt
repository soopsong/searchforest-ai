quantum random walks ( qrw ) were first defined as one - particle sectors of quantum lattice gas automata ( qlga ) . recently , they have been generalized to include history dependence , either on previous coin ( internal , i.e. , spin or velocity ) states or on previous position states . these models have the goal of studying the transition to classicality , or more generally , changes in the performance of quantum walks in algorithmic applications . we show that several history dependent qrw can be identified as one - particle sectors of qlga . this provides a unifying conceptual framework for these models in which the extra degrees of freedom required to store the history information arise naturally as geometrical degrees of freedom on the lattice .
