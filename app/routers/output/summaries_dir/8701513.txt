convergence analysis of consensus algorithms is revisited in the light of the hilbert distance . tsitsiklis lyapunov function is shown to be the hilbert distance to consensus in log coordinates . birkhoff theorem , which proves contraction of the hilbert metric for any positive homogeneous monotone map , provides an early yet general convergence result for consensus algorithms . because birkhoff theorem holds in arbitrary cones , we extend consensus algorithms to the cone of positive definite matrices . the proposed generalization finds applications in the convergence analysis of quantum stochastic maps , which are a generalization of stochastic maps to non - commutative probability spaces .
