the high quantum efficiency of photosynthetic complexes has inspired researchers to explore new routes to utilize this process for photovoltaic devices . quantum coherence has been demonstrated to play a crucial role within this process . herein , we propose a three - dipole system as a model of a new photocell type which exploits the coherence among its three dipoles . we have proved that the efficiency of such a photocell is greatly enhanced by quantum coherence . we have also predicted that the photocurrents can be enhanced by about 49.5 % in such a coherent coupled dipole system compared with the uncoupled dipoles . these results suggest a promising novel design aspect of photosynthesis - mimicking photovoltaic devices .
