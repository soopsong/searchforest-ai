it has been hypothesized that the time evolution of wave functions might include collapses , rather than being governed by the schroedinger equation . the leading models of such an evolution , grw and csl , both have two parameters ( or new constants of nature ) , the collapse width sigma and the collapse rate lambda . we draw a diagram of the sigma - lambda - plane showing the region that is empirically refuted and the region that is philosophically unsatisfactory .
