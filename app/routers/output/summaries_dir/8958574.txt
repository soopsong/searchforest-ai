gravastars have been recently proposed as potential alternatives to explain the astrophysical phenomenology traditionally associated to black holes , raising the question of whether the two objects can be distinguished at all . leaving aside the debate about the processes that would lead to the formation of a gravastar and the astronomical evidence in their support , we here address two basic questions : is a gravastar stable against generic perturbations ? if stable , can an observer distinguish it from a black hole of the same mass ? to answer these questions we construct a general class of gravastars and determine the conditions they must satisfy in order to exist as equilibrium solutions of the einstein equations . for such models we perform a systematic stability analysis against axial - perturbations , computing the real and imaginary parts of the eigenfrequencies . overall , we find that gravastars are stable to axial perturbations , but also that their quasi - normal modes differ from those of a black hole of the same mass and thus can be used to discern , beyond dispute , a gravastar from a black hole .
