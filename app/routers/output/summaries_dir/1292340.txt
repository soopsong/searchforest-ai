we have designed and implemented a photon - pair source , based on the spontaneous four wave mixing ( sfwm ) process in a few - mode fiber , in a geometry which permits multiple , simultaneous sfwm processes , each associated with a distinct combination of transverse modes for the four participating waves . in our source : i ) each process is group - velocity - matched so that it is , by design , nearly - factorable , and ii ) the spectral separation between neighboring processes is greater than the marginal spectral width of each process . consequently , there is a direct correspondence between the joint amplitude of each process and each of the schmidt mode pairs of the overall two - photon state . our approach permits hybrid entanglement in discrete frequency and in transverse mode , whereby control of the number of supported fiber transverse modes allows scalability to higher dimensions while spectral filtering may be used for straightforward schmidt mode discrimination .
