we prove that quantum thermal gaussian input states minimize the output entropy of the multi - mode quantum gaussian attenuators and amplifiers that are entanglement breaking and of the multi - mode quantum gaussian phase contravariant channels among all the input states with a given entropy . this is the first time that this property is proven for a multi - mode channel without restrictions on the input states . a striking consequence of this result is a new lower bound on the output entropy of all the multi - mode quantum gaussian attenuators and amplifiers in terms of the input entropy . we apply this bound to determine new upper bounds to the communication rates in two different scenarios . the first is classical communication to two receivers with the quantum degraded gaussian broadcast channel . the second is the simultaneous classical communication , quantum communication and entanglement generation or the simultaneous public classical communication , private classical communication and quantum key distribution with the gaussian quantum - limited attenuator .
