we demonstrate that a geometric phase , generated via a sequence of four optomechanical interactions , can be used to increase , or generate nonlinearities in the unitary evolution of a mechanical resonator . interactions of this form lead to new mechanisms for preparing mechanical squeezed states , and preparation of non - classical states with significant wigner negativity .
