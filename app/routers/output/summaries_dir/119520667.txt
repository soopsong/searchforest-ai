shortcut to adiabaticity in various quantum systems has attracted much attention with the wide applications in quantum information processing and quantum control . in this paper , we concentrate on stimulated raman shortcut - to - adiabatic passage in quantum three - level systems . to implement counter - diabatic driving but without additional coupling , we first reduce the quantum three - level systems to effective two - level problems at large intermediate - level detuning , or on resonance , apply counter - diabatic driving along with the unitary transformation , and eventually modify the pump and stokes pulses for achieving fast and high - fidelity population transfer . the required laser intensity and stability against parameter variation are further discussed , to demonstrate the advantage of shortcuts to adiabaticity .
