a simple and efficient method for characterization of multidimensional gaussian states is suggested and experimentally demonstrated . our scheme shows analogies with tomography of finite dimensional quantum states , with the covariance matrix playing the role of the density matrix and homodyne detection providing stern - gerlach - like projections . the major difference stems from a different character of relevant noises : while the statistics of stern - gerlach - like measurements is governed by binomial statistics , the detection of quadrature variances correspond to chi - square statistics . for gaussian and near gaussian states the suggested method provides , compared to standard tomography techniques , more stable and reliable reconstructions . in addition , by putting together reconstruction methods for gaussian and arbitrary states , we obtain a tool to detect the non - gaussian character of optical signals .
