quantum open systems evolve according to completely positive , trace preserving maps acting on the density operator , which can equivalently be unraveled in term of so - called quantum trajectories . these stochastic sequences of pure states correspond to the actual dynamics of the quantum system during single realizations of an experiment in which the system 's environment is monitored . in this chapter , we present an extension of stochastic thermodynamics to the case of open quantum systems , which builds on the analogy between the quantum trajectories and the trajectories in phase space of classical stochastic thermodynamics . we analyze entropy production , work and heat exchanges at the trajectory level , identifying genuinely quantum contributions due to decoherence induced by the environment . we present three examples : the thermalization of a quantum system , the fluorescence of a driven qubit and the continuous monitoring of a qubit 's observable .
