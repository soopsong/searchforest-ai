we study entanglement generated between a charge qubit and a bosonic bath due to their joint evolution which leads to pure dephasing of the qubit . we tune the parameters of the interaction , so that the decoherence is quantitatively independent of the number of bosonic modes taken into account and investigate , how the entanglement generated depends on the size of the environment . a second parameter of interest is the mixedness of the initial state of the environment which is controlled by temperature . we show analytically that for a pure initial state of the environment , entanglement does not depend on environment size . for mixed initial states of the environment , the generated entanglement decreases with the increase of environment size . this effect is stronger for larger temperatures , when the environment is initially more mixed , but in the limit of an infinitely large environment , no entanglement is created at any finite temperature .
