we demonstrate compact and accessible squeezed - light magnetometry using four - wave mixing in a single hot rubidium vapor cell . the strong intrinsic coherence of the four wave mixing process results in nonlinear magneto - optical rotation ( nmor ) on each mode of a two mode relative - intensity squeezed state . this framework enables 4.7 db of quantum noise reduction while the opposing polarization rotation signals of the probe and conjugate fields add to increase the total signal to noise ratio .
