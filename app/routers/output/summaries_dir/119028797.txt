this theoretical proposal investigates how resonant interactions occurring when a harmonic oscillator is fed with a stream of entangled qubits allow us to stabilize squeezed states of the harmonic oscillator . we show that the properties of the squeezed state stabilized by this engineered reservoir , including the squeezing strength , can be tuned at will through the parameters of the"input"qubits , albeit in tradeoff with the convergence rate . we also discuss the influence of the type of entanglement in the input , from a pairwise case to a more widely distributed case . this paper can be read in two ways : either as a proposal to stabilize squeezed states , or as a step towards treating quantum systems with time - entangled reservoir inputs .
