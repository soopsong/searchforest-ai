we investigate a doubly resonant optical cavity containing a kerr nonlinear medium that couples two modes by a cross phase modulation . one of these modes is driven by a single photon pulsed field , and the other mode is driven by a coherent state . we find an intrinsic phase noise mechanism for the cross phase shift on the coherent beam which can be attributed to the random emission times of single photons from the cavity . an application to a weak nonlinearity phase gate is discussed .
