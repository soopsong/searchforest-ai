we in this paper study quantum correlations for two neutral spin - particles coupled with a single - mode optical cavity through the usual magnetic interaction . two - spin entangled states for both antiparallel and parallel spin - polarizations are generated under the photon coherent - state assumption . based on the quantum master equation we derive the time - dependent quantum correlation of clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) type explicitly in comparison with the well known entanglement - measure concurrence . in the two - spin singlet state , which is recognized as one eigenstate of the system , the chsh correlation and concurrence remain in their maximum values invariant with time and independent of the average photon - numbers either . the correlation varies periodically with time in the general entangled - states for the low average photon - numbers . when the photon number increases to a certain value the oscillation becomes random and the correlations are suppressed below the bell bound indicating the decoherence of the entangled states . in the high photon - number limit the coherence revivals periodically such that the chsh correlation approaches the upper bound value at particular time points associated with the cavity - field period
