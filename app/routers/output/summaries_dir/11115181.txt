we consider quantum key distribution in the device - independent scenario , i.e. , where the legitimate parties do not know ( or trust ) the exact specification of their apparatus . we show how secure key distribution can be realized against the most general attacks by a quantum adversary under the condition that measurements on different subsystems by the honest parties commute .
