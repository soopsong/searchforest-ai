we experimentally generate and characterize a six - photon polarization entangled state , which is usually called"psi 6 + " . this is realized with a filtering procedure of triple emissions of entangled photon pairs from a single source , which does not use any interferometric overlaps . the setup is very stable and we observe the six - photon state with high fidelity . the observed state can be used for demonstrations of telecloning and secret sharing protocols .
