we investigate the non - markovian dynamics of a qubit - oscillator system embedded in a noisy environment by employing the hierarchical equations of motion approach . it is found that the decoherence rate of the whole qubit - oscillator - bath system can be significantly suppressed by enhancing the coupling strength between the qubit and the harmonic oscillator . moreover , we find that the non - markovian memory character of the bath is able to facilitate a robust quantum coherent dynamics in this qubit - oscillator - bath system . our findings may be used to engineer some tunable coherent manipulations in mesoscopic quantum circuits .
