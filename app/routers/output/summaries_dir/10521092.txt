we consider a discrete - time quantum walk $ w_{t,\kappa}$ at time $ t$ on a graph with joined half lines $ \mathbb{j}_\kappa$ , which is composed of $ \kappa$ half lines with the same origin . our analysis is based on a reduction of the walk on a half line . the idea plays an important role to analyze the walks on some class of graphs with \textit{symmetric } initial states . in this paper , we introduce a quantum walk with an enlarged basis and show that $ w_{t,\kappa}$ can be reduced to the walk on a half line even if the initial state is \textit{asymmetric } . for $ w_{t,\kappa}$ , we obtain two types of limit theorems . the first one is an asymptotic behavior of $ w_{t,\kappa}$ which corresponds to localization . for some conditions , we find that the asymptotic behavior oscillates . the second one is the weak convergence theorem for $ w_{t,\kappa}$. on each half line , $ w_{t,\kappa}$ converges to a density function like the case of the one - dimensional lattice with a scaling order of $ t$. the results contain the cases of quantum walks starting from the general initial state on a half line with the general coin and homogeneous trees with the grover coin .
