we investigate the suitability of toroidal microcavities for strong - coupling cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . numerical modeling of the optical modes demonstrate a significant reduction of modal volume with respect to the whispering gallery modes of dielectric spheres , while retaining the high quality factors representative of spherical cavities . the extra degree of freedom of toroid microcavities can be used to achieve improved cavity qed characteristics . numerical results for atom - cavity coupling strength , critical atom number n_0 and critical photon number n_0 for cesium are calculated and shown to exceed values currently possible using fabry - perot cavities . modeling predicts coupling rates g/(2*pi ) exceeding 700 mhz and critical atom numbers approaching 10^{-7 } in optimized structures . furthermore , preliminary experimental measurements of toroidal cavities at a wavelength of 852 nm indicate that quality factors in excess of 100 million can be obtained in a 50 micron principal diameter cavity , which would result in strong coupling values of ( g/(2*pi),n_0,n_0)=(86 mhz,4.6 * 10^{-4},1.0 * 10^{-3 } ) .
