we show that light scattering from an ultracold gas reveals not only density correlations , but also matter - field interference at its shortest possible distance in an optical lattice , which defines key properties such as tunneling and matter - field phase gradients . this signal can be enhanced by concentrating probe light between lattice sites rather than at density maxima . as addressing between two single sites is challenging , we focus on global nondestructive scattering , allowing probing order parameters , matter - field quadratures and their squeezing . the scattering angular distribution displays peaks even if classical diffraction is forbidden and we derive generalized bragg conditions . light scattering distinguishes all phases in the mott insulator - superfluid - bose glass phase transition .
