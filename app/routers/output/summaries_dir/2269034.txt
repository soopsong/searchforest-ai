we describe how the transient behavior of a tuned and matched resonator circuit and a ringdown suppression pulse may be integrated into an optimal control theory ( oct ) pulse - design algorithm to derive control sequences with limited ringdown that perform a desired quantum operation in the presence of resonator distortions of the ideal waveform . inclusion of ringdown suppression in numerical pulse optimizations significantly reduces spectrometer deadtime when using high quality factor ( high - q ) resonators , leading to increased signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and sensitivity of inductive measurements . to demonstrate the method , we experimentally measure the free - induction decay of an inhomogeneously broadened solid - state free radical spin system at high q. the measurement is enabled by using a numerically optimized bandwidth - limited oct pulse , including ringdown suppression , robust to variations in static and microwave field strengths . we also discuss the applications of pulse design in high - q resonators to universal control of anisotropic - hyperfine coupled electron - nuclear spin systems via electron - only modulation even when the bandwidth of the resonator is significantly smaller than the hyperfine coupling strength . these results demonstrate how limitations imposed by linear response theory may be vastly exceeded when using a sufficiently accurate system model to optimize pulses of high complexity .
