anisotropic nanophotonic structures can couple the levels of a quantum emitter through the quantum interference effect . in this paper we study the coupling of quantum emitters excited states through the modes of a fully anisotropic structure : a structure for which all directions are physically nonequivalent . we consider an anisotropic metasurface as an illustrative example of such a structure . we point out a novel degree of freedom in controlling the temporal dynamics and spectral profiles of quantum emitters : namely , we show that a combination of the metasurface anisotropy and tilt of the emitter quantization axis with respect to the metasurface normal results in nonsymmetric dynamics between the transitions of electrons from left - circular state to the right - circular states and the inverse process . our findings give an additional mechanism for control over the light emission by quantum systems and , vice versa , can be utilized for probing active transitions of quantum emitters .
