recent technological developments have made it increasingly easy to access the non - perturbative regimes of cavity quantum electrodynamics known as ultra or deep strong coupling , where the light - matter coupling becomes comparable to the bare modal frequencies . in this work , we address the adequacy of the broadly used single - mode cavity approximation to describe such regimes . we demonstrate that , in the non - perturbative light - matter coupling regimes , the single - mode models become unphysical , allowing for superluminal signalling . moreover , considering the specific example of the quantum rabi model , we show that the multi - mode description of the electromagnetic field , necessary to account for light propagation at finite speed , yields physical observables that differ radically from their single - mode counterparts already for moderate values of the coupling . our multi - mode analysis also reveals phenomena of fundamental interest on the dynamics of the intracavity electric field , where a free photonic wavefront and a bound state of virtual photons are shown to coexist .
