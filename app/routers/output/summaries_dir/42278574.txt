we report on the design and performance of a point - to - point classical symmetric encryption link with fast key renewal provided by a continuous variable quantum key distribution ( cvqkd ) system . our system was operational and able to encrypt point - to - point communications during more than six months , from the end of july 2010 until the beginning of february 2011 . this field test was the first demonstration of the reliability of a cvqkd system over a long period of time in a server room environment . this strengthens the potential of cvqkd for information technology security infrastructure deployments .
