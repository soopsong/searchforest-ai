in this paper an extended scalability condition is proposed to achieve the ground - state stability for a class of multipartite quantum systems which may involve two - body interactions , and an explicit procedure to construct the dissipation control is presented . moreover , we show that dissipation control can be used for automatic error correction in addition to stabilization . we demonstrate the stabilization and error correction of three - qubit repetition code states using dissipation control .
