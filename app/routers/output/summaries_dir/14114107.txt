simulating fermionic lattice models with qubits requires mapping fermionic degrees of freedom to qubits . the simplest method for this task , the jordan - wigner transformation , yields strings of pauli operators acting on an extensive number of qubits . this overhead can be a hindrance to implementation of qubit - based quantum simulators , especially in the analog context . here we thus review and analyze alternative fermion - to - qubit mappings , including the two approaches by bravyi and kitaev and the auxiliary fermion transformation . the bravyi - kitaev transform is reformulated in terms of a classical data structure and generalized to achieve a further locality improvement for local fermionic models on a rectangular lattice . we conclude that the most compact encoding of the fermionic operators can be done using ancilla qubits with the auxiliary fermion scheme . without introducing ancillas , a variant of the bravyi - kitaev transform provides the most compact fermion - to - qubit mapping for hubbard - like models .
