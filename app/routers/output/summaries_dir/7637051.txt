the small mass and high coherence of nanomechanical resonators render them the ultimate force probe , with applications ranging from biosensing and magnetic resonance force microscopy , to quantum optomechanics . a notorious challenge in these experiments is thermomechanical noise related to dissipation through internal or external loss channels . here , we introduce a novel approach to defining nanomechanical modes , which simultaneously provides strong spatial confinement , full isolation from the substrate , and dilution of the resonator material 's intrinsic dissipation by five orders of magnitude . it is based on a phononic bandgap structure that localises the mode , without imposing the boundary conditions of a rigid clamp . the reduced curvature in the highly tensioned silicon nitride resonator enables mechanical $ q>10^{8}$ at $ 1 \,\mathrm{mhz}$ , yielding the highest mechanical $ qf$-products ( $ > 10^{14}\,\mathrm{hz}$ ) yet reported at room temperature . the corresponding coherence times approach those of optically trapped dielectric particles . extrapolation to $ 4{.}2 $ kelvin predicts $ \sim$quanta / ms heating rates , similar to trapped ions .
