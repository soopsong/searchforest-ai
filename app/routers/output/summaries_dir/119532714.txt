we present a generalized partial transposition separability criterion for the density matrix of a multipartite quantum system . this criterion comprises as special cases the famous peres - horodecki criterion and the recent realignment criterion in [ o. rudolph , quant - ph/0202121 ] and [ k. chen , l.a . wu , quant - ph/0205017 ] . it involves only straightforward matrix manipulations and is easy to apply . a quantitative measure of entanglement based on this criterion is also obtained .
