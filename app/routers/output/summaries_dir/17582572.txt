recently author suggested [ quant - ph/0010071 ] an application of clifford algebras for construction of a"compiler"for universal binary quantum computer together with later development [ quant - ph/0012009 ] of the similar idea for a non - binary base . the non - binary case is related with application of some extension of idea of clifford algebras . it is noncommutative torus defined by polynomial algebraic relations of order l. for l=2 it coincides with definition of clifford algebra . here is presented the joint consideration and comparison of both cases together with some discussion on possible physical consequences .
