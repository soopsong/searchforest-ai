the wigner quasiprobability distribution of a narrowband single - photon state was reconstructed by quantum state tomography using photon - number - resolving measurements with transition - edge sensors ( tes ) at system efficiency 58(2)% . this method makes no assumptions on the nature of the measured state , save for the limitation on photon flux imposed by the tes . negativity of the wigner function was observed in the raw data without any inference or correction for decoherence .
