photon correlations are a cornerstone of quantum optics . recent works [ njp 15 025019 , 033036 ( 2013 ) , pra 90 052111 ( 2014 ) ] have shown that by keeping track of the frequency of the photons , rich landscapes of correlations are revealed . stronger correlations are usually found where the system emission is weak . here , we characterize both the strength and signal of such correlations , through the introduction of the ' frequency resolved mandel parameter ' . we study a plethora of nonlinear quantum systems , showing how one can substantially optimize correlations by combining parameters such as pumping , filtering windows and time delay .
