we generalize the random coding argument of stabilizer codes and derive a lower bound on the quantum capacity of an arbitrary discrete memoryless quantum channel . for the depolarizing channel , our lower bound coincides with that obtained by bennett et al . we also slightly improve the quantum gilbert - varshamov bound for general stabilizer codes , and establish an analogue of the quantum gilbert - varshamov bound for linear stabilizer codes . our proof is restricted to the binary quantum channels , but its extension of to l - adic channels is straightforward .
