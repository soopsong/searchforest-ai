we use the analytic continuation procedure proposed in our earlier works to study the thermodynamics of black holes in 2 + 1 dimensions . a general black hole in 2 + 1 dimensions has g handles hidden behind h horizons . the result of the analytic continuation is a hyperbolic 3-manifold having the topology of a handlebody . the boundary of this handlebody is a compact riemann surface of genus g=2g+h-1 . conformal moduli of this surface encode in a simple way the physical characteristics of the black hole . the moduli space of black holes of a given type ( g , h ) is then the schottky space at genus g. the ( logarithm of the ) thermodynamic partition function of the hole is the kaehler potential for the weil - peterson metric on the schottky space . bekenstein bound on the black hole entropy leads us to conjecture a new strong bound on this kaehler potential .
