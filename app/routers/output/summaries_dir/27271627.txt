using the attractor mechanism for extremal solutions in $ { \cal n}=2 $ gauged supergravity , we construct a $ c$-function that interpolates between the central charges of theories at ultraviolet and infrared conformal fixed points corresponding to anti - de sitter geometries . the $ c$-function we obtain is couched purely in terms of bulk quantities and connects two different dimensional cfts at the stable conformal fixed points under the rg flow .
