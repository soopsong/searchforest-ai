we explore theoretically the nonequilibrium photonic phases of an array of coupled cavities in presence of incoherent driving and dissipation . in particular , we consider a hubbard model system where each site is a kerr nonlinear resonator coupled to a two - level emitter , which is pumped incoherently . within a gutzwiller mean - field approach , we determine the steady - state phase diagram of such a system . we find that , at a critical value of the inter - cavity photon hopping rate , a second - order nonequilibrium phase transition associated with the spontaneous breaking of the $ u(1)$ symmetry occurs . the transition from an incompressible mott - like photon fluid to a coherent delocalized phase is driven by commensurability effects and not by the competition between photon hopping and optical nonlinearity . the essence of the mean - field predictions is corroborated by finite - size simulations obtained with matrix product operators and corner - space renormalization methods .
