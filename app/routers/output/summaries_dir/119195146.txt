recently , there has been increasing interest in designing schemes for quantum computations that are robust against errors . although considerable research has been devoted to developing quantum error correction schemes , much less attention has been paid to optimizing the speed it takes to perform a quantum computation and developing computation models that act on decoherence - free subspaces . speeding up a quantum computation is important , because fewer errors are likely to result . encoding quantum information in a decoherence - free subspace is also important , because errors would be inherently suppressed . in this paper , we consider quantum computation in a decoherence - free subspace and also optimize its speed . to achieve this , we perform certain single - qubit quantum computations by simply permuting the underlying qubits . together with exchange - interactions or ising - interactions and other resonant couplings , we present a new scheme for quantum computation that potentially improves the speed in which a quantum computation can be done .
