we relate the nonlocal properties of noisy entangled states to grothendieck 's constant , a mathematical constant appearing in banach space theory . for two - qubit werner states $ \rho^w_p = p \proj{\psi^-}+(1-p){\one}/{4}$ , we show that there is a local model for projective measurements if and only if $ p \le 1 / k_g(3)$ , where $ k_g(3)$ is grothendieck 's constant of order 3 . known bounds on $ k_g(3)$ prove the existence of this model at least for $ p \lesssim 0.66 $ , quite close to the current region of bell violation , $ p \sim 0.71$. we generalize this result to arbitrary quantum states .
