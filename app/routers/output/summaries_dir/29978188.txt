we give the optimal bounds on the phase - estimation precision for mixed gaussian states in the single - copy and many - copy regimes . specifically , we focus on displaced thermal and squeezed thermal states . we find that while for displaced thermal states an increase in temperature reduces the estimation fidelity , for squeezed thermal states a larger temperature can enhance the estimation fidelity . the many - copy optimal bounds are compared with the minimum variance achieved by three important single - shot measurement strategies . we show that the single - copy canonical phase measurement does not always attain the optimal bounds in the many - copy scenario . adaptive homodyning schemes do attain the bounds for displaced thermal states , but for squeezed states they yield fidelities that are insensitive to temperature variations and are , therefore , sub - optimal . finally , we find that heterodyne measurements perform very poorly for pure states but can attain the optimal bounds for sufficiently mixed states . we apply our results to investigate the influence of losses in an optical metrology experiment . in the presence of losses squeezed states cease to provide heisenberg limited precision and their performance is close to that of coherent states with the same mean photon number .
