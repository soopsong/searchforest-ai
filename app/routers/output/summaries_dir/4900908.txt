quantum systems are affected by interactions with their environments , causing decoherence through two processes : pure dephasing and energy relaxation . for quantum information processing it is important to increase the coherence time of josephson qubits and other artificial two - level atoms . we show theoretically that if the coupling between these qubits and a cavity field is longitudinal and in the ultrastrong - coupling regime , the system is strongly protected against relaxation . vice versa , if the coupling is transverse and in the ultrastrong - coupling regime , the system is protected against pure dephasing . taking advantage of the relaxation suppression , we show that it is possible to enhance their coherence time and use these qubits as quantum memories . indeed , to preserve the coherence from pure dephasing , we prove that it is possible to apply dynamical decoupling . we also use an auxiliary atomic level to store and retrieve quantum information .
