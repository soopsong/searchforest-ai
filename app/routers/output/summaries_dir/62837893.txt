we introduce the simulator for quantum networks and channels ( $ \texttt{squanch}$ ) , an open - source python library for creating parallelized simulations of distributed quantum information processing . the framework includes many features of a general - purpose quantum computing simulator , but it is optimized specifically for simulating quantum networks . it includes functionality to allow users to easily design complex multi - party quantum networks , extensible classes for modeling noisy quantum channels , and a multiprocessed numpy backend for performant simulations . we present an overview of the structure of the library , describing how the various api elements represent the underlying physics and providing simple usage examples for each module . finally , we present several demonstrations of canonical quantum information protocols implemented using this framework .
