we investigate the quantum cramer - rao bounds on the joint multiple - parameter estimation with the gaussian state as a probe . we derive the explicit right logarithmic derivative and symmetric logarithmic derivative operators in such a situation . we compute the corresponding quantum fisher information matrices , and find that they can be fully expressed in terms of the mean displacement and covariance matrix of the gaussian state . finally , we give some examples to show the utility of our analytical results .
