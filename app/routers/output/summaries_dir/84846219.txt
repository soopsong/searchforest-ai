there are numerous applications of the classical ( deterministic ) gronwall inequality . recently , michael scheutzow discovered a stochastic gronwall inequality which provides upper bounds for $ p$-th moments , $ p\in(0,1)$ , of the supremum of nonnegative scalar continuous processes which satisfy a linear integral inequality . in this article we complement this with upper bounds for $ p$-th moments , $ p\in[2,\infty)$ , of the supremum of general it\^o processes which satisfy a suitable one - sided affine - linear growth condition . as example applications , we improve known results on strong local lipschitz continuity in the starting point of solutions of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) , on ( exponential ) moment estimates for sdes , on strong completeness of sdes , and on perturbation estimates for sdes .
