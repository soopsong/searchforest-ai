the interaction of two identical three - level atoms of the types $ v$ , $ \xi$ and $ \lambda$ with a quantized cavity field as well as a driving external classical field is studied . under two certain unitary transformations , the system is converted to a typical form of the jaynes - cummings model for two three - level atoms . the exact analytical solutions of the wave function for different considered atom - field systems are exactly obtained with the help of the laplace transform technique , when the atoms are initially prepared in the topmost excited state and the quantized field is in a coherent state . in order to examine the nonclassicality features of the deduced states , the dynamics of the entanglement between subsystems is discussed via two well - known measures , namely , von neumann entropy of the reduced state and negativity . in addition , we pay attention to the temporal behaviour of quantum statistics of the photons of the field and squeezing phenomenon . meanwhile , the influence of the external classical field on the latter physical quantities is analyzed in detail . the results show that the mentioned quantities can be sensitively controlled via the external classical field . also , numerical computations imply the fact that the nonclassicality features in $ \xi$-type three - level atomic system is more visible than the other two configurations . in addition , it is shown that in the particular case of $ \lambda$-type atomic system , the rank of the reduced density matrix of the three - level atoms is no larger than three , so that negativity fully captures the entanglement of this system and that such entanglement is distillable .
