we formulate a framework for discrete - time quantum walks , motivated by classical random walks with memory . we present a specific representation of the classical walk with memory 2 on which this is based . the framework has no need for coin spaces , it imposes no constraints on the evolution operator other than unitarity , and is unifying of other approaches . as an example we construct a symmetric discrete - time quantum walk on the semi - infinite binary tree . the generating function of the amplitude at the root is computed in closed - form , as a function of time and the initial level n in the tree , and we find the asymptotic and a full numerical solution for the amplitude . it exhibits a sharp interference peak and a power law tail , as opposed to the exponentially decaying tail of a broadly peaked distribution of the classical symmetric random walk on a binary tree . the probability peak is orders of magnitude larger than it is for the classical walk ( already at small n ) . the quantum walk shows a polynomial algorithmic speedup in n over the classical walk , which we conjecture to be of the order 2/3 , based on strong trends in data .
