in recent years , new neural network architectures designed to operate on graph - structured data have pushed the state - of - the - art in the field . a large set of these architectures utilize a form of classical random walks to diffuse information . we propose quantum walk neural networks ( qwnn ) , a novel graph neural network architecture based on quantum random walks , the quantum parallel to classical random walks . a qwnn learns a quantum walk on a graph to construct a diffusion operator which can then be applied to graph - structured data . we demonstrate the use of qwnns on a variety of prediction tasks on graphs involving temperature , biological , and molecular datasets .
