we experimentally demonstrate a simple method to measure the biphoton joint spectrum by mapping the spectral information onto the temporal domain using a dispersive medium . various top - hat spectral filters are used to limit the spectral ( and hence , temporal ) extent of the broadband downconversion photons measured . the sharp edges of the spectral filters are utilized as spectral markers for dispersion characterization of the dispersive medium . this method allows dispersion characterization and joint spectral measurement to be completed simultaneously . the joint spectrum ( which extends beyond 100 nm , centered about 1.5 micron ) of the type - ii downconverted photon pairs generated from a poled optical fiber is obtained with this method .
