fidelity is known to increase through any kraus map : the fidelity between two density matrices is less than the fidelity between their images via a kraus map . we prove here that , in average , fidelity is also increasing for any discrete - time quantum filter : fidelity between the density matrix of the underlying markov chain and the density matrix of its associated quantum filter is a sub - martingale . this result is not restricted to pure states . it also holds true for mixed states .
