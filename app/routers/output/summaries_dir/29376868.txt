we report the development of a fiber - based single spatial mode source of photon - pairs where the efficiency of extracting photon - pairs is improved over a previous source [ 18 ] through the use of fiber - end expansion and bragg filters . this improvement in efficiency enabled a spectrally bright and pure photon - pair source having a small second - order correlation function ( 0.03 ) and a raw spectral brightness of 44,700 pairs/(s nm mw ) . the source can be configured to generate entangled photon - pairs , characterized via optimal and minimal quantum state tomography , to have a fidelity of 97 % and tangle of 92 % , without subtracting any background .
