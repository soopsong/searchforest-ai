we discuss how to build some partially entangled states of $ n$ two - state quantum systems ( qubits ) . the optimal partially entangled state with a high degree of symmetry is considered to be useful for overcoming a shot noise limit of ramsey spectroscopy under some decoherence . this state is invariant under permutation of any two qubits and inversion between the ground state $ |0\ket$ and an excited state $ |1\ket$ for each qubit . we show that using selective phase shifts in certain basis vectors and grover 's inversion about average operations , we can construct this high symmetric entangled state by $ ( { polynomial in $ n$})\times 2^{n/2}$ successive unitary transformations that are applied on two or three qubits . we can apply our method to build more general entangled states .
