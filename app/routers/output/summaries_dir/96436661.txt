in multiparty quantum systems , the monogamy inequality proposes an upper bound on the distribution of bipartite quantum correlation between a single party and each of the remaining parties in the system , in terms of the amount of quantum correlation shared by that party with the rest of the system taken as a whole . however , it is well - known that not all quantum correlation measures universally satisfy the monogamy inequality . in this work , we aim at determining the non - trivial value by which the monogamy inequality can be violated by a quantum correlation measure . using an information - theoretic complementarity relation between the normalized purity and quantum correlation in any given multiparty state , we obtain a non - trivial lower bound on the negative monogamy score for the quantum correlation measure . in particular , for the three - qubit states the lower bound is equal to the negative von neumann entropy of the single qubit reduced density matrix . we analytically examine the tightness of the derived lower bound for certain $ n$-qubit quantum states . further , we report numerical results of the same for monogamy violating correlation measures using haar uniformly generated three - qubit states .
