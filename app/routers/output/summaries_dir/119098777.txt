light beams with orbital angular momentum ( oam ) are convenient carriers of quantum information . they can be also used for imparting rotational motion to particles and provide high resolution in imaging . due to the conservation of oam in parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) , signal and idler photons generated at low gain have perfectly anti - correlated oam values . it is interesting to study the oam properties of high - gain pdc , where the same oam modes can be populated with large , but correlated , numbers of photons . here we investigate the oam spectrum of high - gain pdc and show that the oam mode content can be controlled by varying the pump power and the configuration of the source . in our experiment , we use a source consisting of two nonlinear crystals separated by an air gap . we discuss the oam properties of pdc radiation emitted by this source and suggest possible modifications .
