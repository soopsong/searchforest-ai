we present quantum algorithms for solving two problems regarding stochastic processes . the first algorithm prepares the thermal gibbs state of a quantum system and runs in time almost linear in $ \sqrt{n \beta/{\cal z}}$ and polynomial in $ \log(1/\epsilon)$ , where $ n$ is the hilbert space dimension , $ \beta$ is the inverse temperature , $ { \cal z}$ is the partition function , and $ \epsilon$ is the desired precision of the output state . our quantum algorithm exponentially improves the dependence on $ 1/\epsilon$ and quadratically improves the dependence on $ \beta$ of known quantum algorithms for this problem . the second algorithm estimates the hitting time of a markov chain . for a sparse stochastic matrix $ p$ , it runs in time almost linear in $ 1/(\epsilon \delta^{3/2})$ , where $ \epsilon$ is the absolute precision in the estimation and $ \delta$ is a parameter determined by $ p$ , and whose inverse is an upper bound of the hitting time . our quantum algorithm quadratically improves the dependence on $ 1/\epsilon$ and $ 1/\delta$ of the analog classical algorithm for hitting - time estimation . both algorithms use tools recently developed in the context of hamiltonian simulation , spectral gap amplification , and solving linear systems of equations .
