we propose a general quantum theory of optical phase and instantaneous frequency in the time domain for slowly varying optical signals . guided by classical estimation theory , we design homodyne phase - locked loops that enable quantum - limited measurements of temporal phase and instantaneous frequency . standard and heisenberg quantum limits to such measurements are then derived . for optical sensing applications , we propose multipass and fabry - p\'erot position and velocity sensors that take advantage of the signal - to - noise - ratio enhancement effect of wideband angle modulation without requiring nonclassical light . we also generalize our theory to three spatial dimensions for nonrelativistic bosons and define an hermitian fluid velocity operator , which provides a theoretical underpinning to the current - algebra approach of quantum hydrodynamics .
