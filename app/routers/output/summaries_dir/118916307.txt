motivated by the new theoretical paradigm that views spacetime geometry as emerging from the entanglement of a pre - geometric theory , we investigate the issue of the signature of the presence of horizons and localized matter on the entanglement entropy ( ee ) s_e for the case of three - dimensional ads ( ads_3 ) gravity . we use the holographically dual two - dimensional cft on the torus and the related modular symmetry in order to treat bulk black holes and conical singularities ( sourced by pointlike masses not shielded by horizons ) on the same footing . in the regime where boundary tori can be approximated by cylinders we are able to give universal expressions for the ee of black holes and conical singularities . we argue that the presence of horizons / localized matter in the bulk is encoded in the ee in terms of ( i ) enhancement / reduction of the entanglement of the ads_3 vacuum , ( ii ) scaling as area / volume of the leading term of the perturbative expansion of s_e , ( iii ) exponential / periodic behaviour of s_e , ( iv ) presence of unaccessible regions in the noncompact / compact dimension of the boundary cylinder . in particular , we show that the reduction effect of matter on the entanglement of the vacuum found by verlinde for the de sitter vacuum extends to the ads_3 vacuum
