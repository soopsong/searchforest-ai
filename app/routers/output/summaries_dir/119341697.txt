mitarai , negoro , kitagawa , and fujii proposed a type of parameterized quantum circuits , for which they gave a way to estimate derivatives wrt the parameters using only changes in the values of the parameters , not in the circuit itself , i.e. , no ancillas or controlled operations . recently , schuld et al . have extended the results , but they need to revert to ancillas and controlled operations for some cases . in this note , we extend the types of minkif circuits for which derivatives can be computed without ancillas or controlled operations --- at the cost of a larger number of evaluation points . we also propose a"training"(i.e . , optimizing the parameters ) which takes advantage of our approach .
