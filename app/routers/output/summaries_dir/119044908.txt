in this paper we investigate the possibility to make complete bell measurements on a product hilbert space of two two - level bosonic systems . we restrict our tools to linear elements , like beam splitters and phase shifters , delay lines and electronically switched linear elements , photo - detectors , and auxiliary bosons . as a result we show that with these tools a never failing bell measurement is impossible .
