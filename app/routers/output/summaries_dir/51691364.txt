recently , several groups have investigated quantum analogues of random walk algorithms , both on a line and on a circle . it has been found that the quantum versions have markedly different features to the classical versions . namely , the variance on the line , and the mixing time on the circle increase quadratically faster in the quantum versions as compared to the classical versions . here , we propose a scheme to implement the quantum random walk on a line and on a circle in an ion trap quantum computer . with current ion trap technology , the number of steps that could be experimentally implemented will be relatively small . however , we show how the enhanced features of these walks could be observed experimentally . in the limit of strong decoherence , the quantum random walk tends to the classical random walk . by measuring the degree to which the walk remains ` quantum ' , this algorithm could serve as an important benchmarking protocol for ion trap quantum computers .
