scale invariance usually occurs in extended systems where correlation functions decay algebraically in space and/or time . here we introduce a new type of scale invariance , occurring in the distribution functions of physical observables . at equilibrium these functions decay over a typical scale set by the temperature , but they can become scale invariant in a sudden quantum quench . we exemplify this effect through the analysis of linear and non - linear quantum oscillators . we find that their distribution functions generically diverge logarithmically close to the stable points of the classical dynamics . our study opens the possibility to address integrability and its breaking in distribution functions , with immediate applications to matter - wave interferometers .
