proposed near - future upgrades of the current advanced interferometric gravitational wave detectors include the usage of frequency dependent squeezed light to reduce the current sensitivity - limiting quantum noise . we quantify and describe the degradation effects that spatial mode - mismatches between optical resonators have on the squeezed field . these mode - mismatches can to first order be described by scattering of light into second - order gaussian modes . as a demonstration of principle , we also show that squeezing the second - order hermite - gaussian modes $ \mathrm{hg}_{02}$ and $ \mathrm{hg}_{20}$ , in addition to the fundamental mode , has the potential to increase the robustness to spatial mode - mismatches . this scheme , however , requires independently optimized squeeze angles for each squeezed spatial mode , which would be challenging to realise in practise .
