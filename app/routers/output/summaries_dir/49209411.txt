we compare two approaches to refine the"linear model"of cavity optomechanics , in order to describe radiation pressure effects that are beyond first order in the coupling constant . we compare corrections derived from ( i ) a widely used phenomenological hamiltonian that conserves the photon number and ( ii ) a two - mode truncation of c. k. law 's microscopic model , which we take as the"true"hamiltonian of the system . while these approaches agree at first order , the latter model does not conserve the photon number , resulting in challenging computations from second order onwards . our numerics suggest that the phenomenological hamiltonian significantly improves the linear model , yet it does not fully capture all second - order corrections arising from the c. k. law model . we conclude that , even when the mechanical frequency is much lower than the cavity one , photon number conservation must be eventually given up to model cavity optomechanics with high accuracy .
