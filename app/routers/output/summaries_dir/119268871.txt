we introduce and analyze a dispersive qubit readout scheme where two - mode squeezing is generated directly in the measurement cavities . the resulting suppression of noise enables fast , high- fidelity readout of naturally weakly coupled qubits , and the possibility to protect strongly coupled qubits from decoherence by weakening their coupling . unlike other approaches exploiting squeezing , our setup avoids the difficult task of transporting and injecting with high fidelity an externally - generated squeezed state . our setup is also surprisingly robust against unwanted non - qnd backaction effects , as interference naturally suppresses purcell decay : the system acts as its own purcell filter . our setup is compatible with the experimental state - of - the - art in circuit qed systems , but the basic idea could also be realized in other systems .
