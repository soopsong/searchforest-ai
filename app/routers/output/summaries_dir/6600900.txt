we consider the problem of communicating quantum states by simultaneously making use of a noiseless classical channel , a noiseless quantum channel and shared entanglement . we specifically study the version of the problem in which the sender is given knowledge of the state to be communicated . in this setting , a trade - off arises between the three resources , some portions of which have been investigated previously in the contexts of the quantum - classical trade - off in data compression , remote state preparation and superdense coding of quantum states , each of which amounts to allowing just two out of these three resources . we present a formula for the triple resource trade - off that reduces its calculation to evaluating the data compression trade - off formula . in the process , we also construct protocols achieving all the optimal points . these turn out to be achievable by trade - off coding and suitable time - sharing between optimal protocols for cases involving two resources out of the three mentioned above .
