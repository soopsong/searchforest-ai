cloning of observables , unlike standard cloning of states , aims at copying the information encoded in the statistics of a class of observables rather then on quantum states themselves . in such a process the emphasis is on the quantum operation ( evolution plus measurement ) necessary to retrieve the original information . we analyze , for qubit systems , the cloning of a class generated by two noncommuting observables , elucidating the relationship between such a process and joint measurements . this helps in establishing an optimality criterion for cloning of observables . we see that , even if the cloning machine is designed to act on the whole class generated by two noncommuting observables , the same optimal performances of a joint measurement can be attained . finally , the connection with state dependent cloning is enlightened .
