we present a systematic study of the purity for gaussian states of single - mode continuous variable systems . we prove the connection of purity to observable quantities for these states , and show that the joint measurement of two conjugate quadratures is necessary and sufficient to determine the purity at any time . the statistical reliability and the range of applicability of the proposed measurement scheme is tested by means of monte carlo simulated experiments . we then consider the dynamics of purity in noisy channels . we derive an evolution equation for the purity of general gaussian states both in thermal and squeezed thermal baths . we show that purity is maximized at any given time for an initial coherent state evolving in a thermal bath , or for an initial squeezed state evolving in a squeezed thermal bath whose asymptotic squeezing is orthogonal to that of the input state .
