we provide general conditions for which bosonic quadratic hamiltonians on fock spaces can be diagonalized by bogoliubov transformations . our results cover the case when quantum systems have infinite degrees of freedom and the associated one - body kinetic and paring operators are unbounded . our sufficient conditions are optimal in the sense that they become necessary when the relevant one - body operators commute .
