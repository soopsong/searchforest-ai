quantum network is a set of nodes connected with channels , through which the nodes communicate photons and classical information . classical structural complexity of a quantum network may be defined through its physical structure , i.e. mutual position of nodes and channels connecting them . we show here that the classical structural complexity of a quantum network does not restrict the structural complexity of entanglement graphs , which may be created in the quantum network with local operations and classical communication . we show , in particular , that 1d quantum network can simulate both simple entanglement graphs such as lattices and random graphs and complex small - world graphs .
