we present a nonlinear stochastic schroedinger equation for pure states describing non - markovian diffusion of quantum trajectories . it provides an unravelling of the evolution of a quantum system coupled to a finite or infinite number of harmonic oscillators , without any approximation . its power is illustrated by several examples , including measurement - like situations , dissipation , and quantum brownian motion . in some examples , we treat the environment phenomenologically as an infinite reservoir with fluctuations of arbitrary correlation . in other examples the environment consists of a finite number of oscillators . in these quasi - periodic cases we see the reversible decay of a ` schroedinger cat ' state . finally , our description of open systems is compatible with different positions of the ` heisenberg cut ' between system and environment .
