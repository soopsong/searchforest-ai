the characterization of physical systems requires a comprehensive understanding of quantum effects . one aspect is a proper quantification of the strength of such quantum phenomena . here , a general convex ordering of quantum states will be introduced which is based on the algebraic definition of classical states . this definition resolves the ambiguity of the quantumness quantification using topological distance measures . classical operations on quantum states will be considered to further generalize the ordering prescription . our technique can be used for a natural and unambiguous quantification of general quantum properties whose classical reference has a convex structure . we apply this method to typical scenarios in quantum optics and quantum information theory to study measures which are based on the fundamental quantum superposition principle .
