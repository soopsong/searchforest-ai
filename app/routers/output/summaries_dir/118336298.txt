similar to the three - qubit greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) symmetry we explore the four - qubit ghz symmetry group and its subgroup called restricted ghz symmetry group . while the set of symmetric states under the whole group transformation is represented by three real parameters , the set of symmetric states under the subgroup transformation is represented by two real parameters . after comparing the symmetric states for whole and subgroup , the entanglement is examined for the latter set . it is shown that the set has only two slocc classes , $ l_{abc_2}$ and $ g_{abcd}$. extension to the multi - qubit system is briefly discussed .
