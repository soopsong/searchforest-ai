we experimentally demonstrate the generation of multi - photon fock states with up to three photons in well - defined spatial - temporal modes synchronized with a classical clock . the states are characterized using quantum optical homodyne tomography to ensure mode selectivity . the three - photon fock states are probabilistically generated by pulsed spontaneous parametric down conversion at a rate of one per second , enabling complete characterization in 12 hours .
