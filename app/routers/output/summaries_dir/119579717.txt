we will see that vectors in $ \cc^n$ have natural analogs as rank 2 projections in $ \rr^{2n}$ and that this association transfers many vector properties into properties of rank two projections on $ \rr^{2n}$. we believe that this association will answer many open problems in $ \cc^n$ where the corresponding problem in $ \rr^n$ has already been answered - and vice versa . as a application , we will see that phase retrieval ( respectively , phase retrieval by projections ) in $ \cc^n$ transfers to a variation of phase retrieval by rank 2 projections ( respectively , phase retrieval by projections ) on $ \rr^{2n}$. as a consequence , we will answer the open problem : give the complex version of edidin 's theorem \cite{e } which classifies when projections do phase retrieval in $ \rr^n$. as another application we answer a longstanding open problem concerning fusion frames by showing that fusion frames in $ \cc^n$ associate with fusion frames in $ \rr^{2n}$ with twice the dimension . as another application , we will show that a family of mutually unbiased bases in $ \cc^n$ has a natural analog as a family of mutually unbiased rank 2 projections in $ \rr^{2n}$. the importance here is that there are very few real mutually unbiased bases but now there are unlimited numbers of real mutually unbiased rank 2 projections to be used in their place . as another application , we will give a variaton of edidin 's theorem which gives a surprising classification of norm retrieval . finally , we will show that equiangular and biangular frames in $ \cc^n$ have an analog as equiangular and biangular rank 2 projections in $ \rr^{2n}$.
