inter - area oscillations in bulk power systems are typically poorly controllable by means of local decentralized control . recent research efforts have been aimed at developing wide- area control strategies that involve communication of remote signals . in conventional wide - area control , the control structure is fixed a priori typically based on modal criteria . in contrast , here we employ the recently - introduced paradigm of sparsity- promoting optimal control to simultaneously identify the optimal control structure and optimize the closed - loop performance . to induce a sparse control architecture , we regularize the standard quadratic performance index with an l1-penalty on the feedback matrix . the quadratic objective functions are inspired by the classic slow coherency theory and are aimed at imitating homogeneous networks without inter - area oscillations . we use the new england power grid model to demonstrate that the proposed combination of the sparsity - promoting control design with the slow coherency objectives performs almost as well as the optimal centralized control while only making use of a single wide - area communication link . in addition to this nominal performance , we also demonstrate that our control strategy yields favorable robustness margins and that it can be used to identify a sparse control architecture for control design via alternative means .
