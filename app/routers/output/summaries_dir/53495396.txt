we demonstrate a dual - rail optical raman memory inside a polarization interferometer ; this enables us to store polarization - encoded information at ghz bandwidths in a room - temperature atomic ensemble . by performing full process tomography on the system we measure up to 97\pm1 % process fidelity for the storage and retrieval process . at longer storage times , the process fidelity remains high , despite a loss of efficiency . the fidelity is 86\pm4 % for 1.5 \mu s storage time , which is 5,000 times the pulse duration . hence high fidelity is combined with a large time - bandwidth product . this high performance , with an experimentally simple setup , demonstrates the suitability of the raman memory for integration into large - scale quantum networks .
