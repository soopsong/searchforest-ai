we report on the usage of a linear optics phase gate for distinguishing all four bell states simultaneously in a quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping protocol . this is demonstrated by full state tomography of the one and two qubit output states of the two protocols , yielding average state fidelities of about 0.83 and 0.77 , respectively . in addition , the performance of the teleportation channel is characterised by quantum process tomography . the non classical properties of the entanglement swapping output states are further confirmed by the violation of a chsh - type bell inequality of 2.14 on average .
