we explore a distance-3 homological css quantum code , namely the small stellated dodecahedron code , for dense storage of quantum information and we compare its performance with the distance-3 surface code . the data and ancilla qubits of the small stellated dodecahedron code can be located on the edges resp . vertices of a small stellated dodecahedron , making this code suitable for 3d connectivity . this code encodes 8 logical qubits into 30 physical qubits ( plus 22 ancilla qubits for parity check measurements ) as compared to 1 logical qubit into 9 physical qubits ( plus 8 ancilla qubits ) for the surface code . we develop fault - tolerant parity check circuits and a decoder for this code , allowing us to numerically assess the circuit - based pseudo - threshold .
