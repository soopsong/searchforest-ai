fingerprinting enables two parties to infer whether the messages they hold are the same or different when the cost of communication is high : each message is associated with a smaller fingerprint and comparisons between messages are made in terms of their fingerprints alone . in the simultaneous message passing model , it is known that fingerprints composed of quantum information can be made exponentially smaller than those composed of classical information . for small message lengths , we present constructions of optimal classical fingerprinting strategies with one - sided error , in both the one - way and simultaneous message passing models , and provide bounds on the worst - case error probability with the help of extremal set theory . the performance of these protocols is then compared to that for quantum fingerprinting strategies constructed from spherical codes , equiangular tight frames and mutually unbiased bases .
