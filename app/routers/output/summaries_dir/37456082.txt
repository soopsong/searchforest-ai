the click statistics from on - off detector systems is quite different from the counting statistics of the more traditional detectors . this necessitates introduction of new parameters to characterize the nonclassicality of fields from measurements using on - off detectors . to properly replace the mandel q_m parameter , we introduce a parameter q_b . a negative value represents a sub - binomial statistics . this is possible only for quantum fields , even for super - poisson light . it eliminates the problems encountered in discerning nonclassicality using mandel 's q_m for on - off data .
