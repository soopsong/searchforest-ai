it has been proposed in \cite{park:2014tia } that 4d einstein gravity becomes effectively reduced to 3d after solving the lagrangian analogues of the hamiltonian and momentum constraints of the hamiltonian quantization . the analysis in \cite{park:2014tia } was carried out at the classical / operator level . we review the proposal and make a transition to the path integral account . we then set the stage for explicitly carrying out the two - loop renormalization procedure of the resulting 3d action . we also address a potentially subtle issue in the gravity context concerning whether renormalizability does not depend on the background around which the original action is expanded .
