we study the shuttling of an atom in a trap with controllable position and frequency . using invariant - based inverse engineering , protocols in which the trap is simultaneously displaced and expanded are proposed to speed up transport between stationary trap locations as well as launching processes with narrow final - velocity distributions . depending on the physical constraints imposed , either simultaneous or sequential approaches may be faster . we consider first a perfectly harmonic trap , and then extend the treatment to generic traps . finally , we apply this general framework to a double - well potential to separate different motional states with different launching velocities .
