we investigate quantum walks in multiple dimensions with different quantum coins . we augment the model by assuming that at each step the amplitudes of the coin state are multiplied by random phases . this model enables us to study in detail the role of decoherence in quantum walks and to investigate the quantum - to - classical transition . we also provide classical analogues of the quantum random walks studied . interestingly enough , it turns out that the classical counterparts of some quantum random walks are classical random walks with a memory and biased coin . in addition random phase shifts"simplify"the dynamics ( the cross interference terms of different paths vanish on average ) and enable us to give a compact formula for the dispersion of such walks .
