physical realizability addresses the question of whether it is possible to implement a given lti system as a quantum system . it is in general not true that a given synthesized quantum controller described by a set of stochastic differential equations is equivalent to some physically meaningful quantum system . however , if additional quantum noises are permitted in the implementation it is always possible to implement an arbitrary lti system as a quantum system . in this paper we give an expression for the exact number of noises required to implement a given lti system as a quantum system . furthermore , we focus our attention on proving that this is a minimum , that is , it is not possible to implement the system as a quantum system with a smaller number of additional quantum noises .
