we investigate how the dynamical casimir effect can entangle quantum systems in different coupling regimes of circuit quantum electrodynamics , and show the robustness of such entanglement generation against dissipative effects with current technology . we consider two qubit - resonator systems , which are coupled by a squid driven with an external magnetic field , and explore the entire range of coupling regimes between each qubit and its respective resonator . in this scheme , we derive a semianalytic explanation for the entanglement generation between both superconducting qubits when they are coupled to their resonators in the strong coupling regime . for the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes , we design feasible protocols to generate maximally - entangled polaritonic states .
