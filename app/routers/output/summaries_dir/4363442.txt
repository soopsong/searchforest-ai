we describe a novel method for making microbottle - shaped lasers by using a co$_2 $ laser to melt er : yb glass onto silica microcapillaries or fibres . this is realised by the fact that the two glasses have different melting points . the co$_2 $ laser power is controlled to flow the doped glass around the silica cylinder . in the case of a capillary , the resulting geometry is a hollow , microbottle - shaped resonator . this is a simple method for fabricating a number of glass wgm lasers with a wide range of sizes on a single , micron - scale structure . the er : yb doped glass outer layer is pumped at 980 nm via a tapered optical fibre and whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) lasing is recorded around 1535 nm . this structure facilitates a new way to thermo - optically tune the microlaser modes by passing gas through the capillary . the cooling effect of the gas flow shifts the wgms towards shorter wavelengths , thus thermal tuning of the lasing modes over 70 ghz is achieved . results are fitted using the theory of hot wire anemometry , allowing the flow rate to be calibrated with a flow sensitivity as high as 100 ghz / sccm . strain tuning of the microlaser modes by up to 50 ghz is also demonstrated .
