adversarial learning is one of the most successful approaches to modelling high - dimensional probability distributions from data . the quantum computing community has recently begun to generalize this idea and to look for potential applications . in this work , we derive an adversarial algorithm for the problem of approximating an unknown quantum pure state . although this could be done on universal quantum computers , the adversarial formulation enables us to execute the algorithm on near - term quantum computers . two parametrized circuits are optimized in tandem : one tries to approximate the target state , the other tries to distinguish between target and approximated state . supported by numerical simulations , we show that resilient backpropagation algorithms perform remarkably well in optimizing the two circuits . we use the bipartite entanglement entropy to design an efficient heuristic for the stopping criterion . our approach may find application in quantum state tomography .
