engineered quantum systems allow us to observe phenomena that are not easily accessible naturally . the lego - like nature of superconducting circuits makes them particularly suited for building and coupling artificial atoms . here , we introduce an artificial molecule , composed of two strongly coupled fluxonium atoms , which possesses a tunable magnetic moment . using an applied external flux , one can tune the molecule between two regimes : one in which the ground - excited state manifold has a magnetic dipole moment and one in which the ground - excited state manifold has only a magnetic quadrupole moment . by varying the applied external flux , we find the coherence of the molecule to be limited by local flux noise . the ability to engineer and control artificial molecules paves the way for building more complex circuits for protected qubits and quantum simulation .
