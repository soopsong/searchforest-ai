we present the first demonstration of all - optical squeezing in an on - chip monolithically integrated cmos - compatible platform . our device consists of a low loss silicon nitride microring optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) with a gigahertz cavity linewidth . we measure 1.7 db ( 5 db corrected for losses ) of sub - shot noise quantum correlations between bright twin beams generated in the microring four - wave - mixing opo pumped above threshold . this experiment demonstrates a compact , robust , and scalable platform for quantum optics and quantum information experiments on - chip .
