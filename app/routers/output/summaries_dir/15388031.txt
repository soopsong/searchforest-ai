based on a recently developed notion of physical realizability for quantum linear stochastic systems , we formulate a quantum lqg optimal control problem for quantum linear stochastic systems where the controller itself may also be a quantum system and the plant output signal can be fully quantum . such a control scheme is often referred to in the quantum control literature as"coherent feedback control . ' ' it distinguishes the present work from previous works on the quantum lqg problem where measurement is performed on the plant and the measurement signals are used as input to a fully classical controller with no quantum degrees of freedom . the difference in our formulation is the presence of additional non - linear and linear constraints on the coefficients of the sought after controller , rendering the problem as a type of constrained controller design problem . due to the presence of these constraints our problem is inherently computationally hard and this also distinguishes it in an important way from the standard lqg problem . we propose a numerical procedure for solving this problem based on an alternating projections algorithm and , as initial demonstration of the feasibility of this approach , we provide fully quantum controller design examples in which numerical solutions to the problem were successfully obtained . for comparison , we also consider the case of classical linear controllers that use direct or indirect measurements , and show that there exists a fully quantum linear controller which offers an improvement in performance over the classical ones .
