we propose a bosonic josephson junction ( bjj ) in two nonlinear mechanical resonator coupled through two - phonon exchange interaction induced by quadratic optomechanical couplings . the nonlinear dynamic equations and effective hamiltonian are derived to describe behaviors of the bjj . we show that the bjj can work in two different dynamical regimes : josephson oscillation and macroscopic self - trapping . the system can transfer from one regime to the other one when the self - interaction and asymmetric parameters exceed their critical values . we predict that a transition from josephson oscillation to macroscopic self - trapping can be induced by the phonon damping in the asymmetric bjjs . our results opens up a way to demonstrate bjj with two - phonon exchange interaction and can be applied to other systems , such as the optical and microwave systems .
