this paper concerns a class of uncertain linear quantum systems subject to quadratic perturbations in the system hamiltonian . a small gain approach is used to evaluate the performance of the given quantum system . in order to get improved control performance , we propose two methods to design a coherent controller for the system . one is to formulate a static quantum controller by adding a controller hamiltonian to the given system , and the other is to build a dynamic quantum controller which is directly coupled to the given system . both controller design methods are given in terms of lmis and a non - convex equality . hence , a rank constrained lmi method is used as a numerical procedure . an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the proposed methods and also to make a performance comparison with different controller design methods . results show that for the same uncertain quantum system , the dynamic quantum controller can offer an improvement in performance over the static quantum controller .
