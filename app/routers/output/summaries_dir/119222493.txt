we study the relation between quantum fluctuations and the significant enhancement of the performance of quantum annealing in a mean - field hamiltonian . first - order quantum phase transitions were shown to be reduced to second order by antiferromagnetic transverse interactions in a mean - field - type many - body - interacting ising spin system in a transverse field , which means an exponential speedup of quantum annealing by adiabatic quantum computation . we investigate if and how quantum effects manifest themselves around these first- and second - order phase transitions to understand if the antiferromagnetic transverse interactions appended to the conventional transverse - field ising model induce notable quantum effects . by measuring the proximity of the semiclassical spin - coherent state to the true ground state as well as the magnitude of the concurrence representing entanglement , we conclude that significant quantum fluctuations exist around second - order transitions , whereas quantum effects are much less prominent at first - order transitions . although the location of the transition point can be predicted by the classical picture , system properties near the transition need quantum - mechanical descriptions for a second - order transition but not necessarily for first order . it is also found that quantum fluctuations are large within the ferromagnetic phase after a second - order transition from the paramagnetic phase . these results suggest that the antiferromagnetic transverse interactions induce marked quantum effects , and this fact would be related to closely to the significant enhancement of the performance of quantum annealing .
