this paper is concerned with variational methods for nonlinear open quantum systems with markovian dynamics governed by hudson - parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations . the latter are driven by quantum wiener processes of the external boson fields and are specified by the system hamiltonian and system - field coupling operators . we consider the system response to perturbations of these energy operators and introduce a transverse hamiltonian which encodes the propagation of the perturbations through the unitary system - field evolution . this provides a tool for the infinitesimal perturbation analysis and development of optimality conditions for coherent quantum control problems . we apply the transverse hamiltonian variational technique to a mean square optimal coherent quantum filtering problem for a measurement - free cascade connection of quantum systems .
