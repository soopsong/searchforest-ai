in this paper we complete the study on the asymptotic behaviour of the entanglement entropy for kitaev chains with long range pairing . we discover that when the couplings decay with the distance with a critical exponent new properties for the asymptotic growth of the entropy appear . the coefficient of the leading term is not universal any more and the connection with conformal field theories is lost . we perform a numerical and analytical approach to the problem showing a perfect agreement . in order to carry out the analytical study , a new technique for computing the asymptotic behaviour of block toeplitz determinants with discontinuous symbols has been developed .
