we investigate spin squeezing , quantum entanglement and second order coherence in two coupled , driven , dissipative , nonlinear cavities . we compare these quantum statistical properties for the cavities coupled with either single or two - photon exchange . solving the quantum optical master equation of the system numerically in the steady state , we calculate the zero - time delay second - order correlation function for the coherence , genuine two - mode entanglement parameter , and an optimal spin squeezing inequality associated with particle entanglement . we identify regimes of distinct quantum statistical character depending on the relative strength of photon - exchange and nonlinearity . moreover , we examine the effects of weak and strong drives on these quantum statistical regimes .
