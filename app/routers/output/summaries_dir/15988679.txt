we analyze the dynamics of a two - level system subject to driving by large - amplitude external fields , focusing on the resonance properties in the case of driving around the region of avoided level crossing . in particular , we consider three main questions that characterize resonance dynamics : ( 1 ) the resonance condition , ( 2 ) the frequency of the resulting oscillations on resonance and ( 3 ) the width of the resonance . we identify the regions of validity of different approximations . in a large region of the parameter space , we use a geometric picture in order to obtain both a simple understanding of the dynamics and quantitative results . the geometric approach is obtained by dividing the evolution into discrete time steps , with each time step described by either a phase shift on the basis states or a coherent mixing process corresponding to a landau - zener crossing . we compare the results of the geometric picture with those of a rotating - wave approximation . we also comment briefly on the prospects of employing strong driving as a useful tool to manipulate two - level systems .
