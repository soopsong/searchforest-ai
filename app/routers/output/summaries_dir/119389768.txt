the recently derived input - output relations for the radiation field at a dispersive and absorbing four - port device [ t. gruner and d.-g . welsch , phys . rev . a 54 , 1661 ( 1996 ) ] are used to derive the unitary transformation that relates the output quantum state to the input quantum state , including radiation and matter and without placing frequency restrictions . it is shown that for each frequency the transformation can be regarded as a well - behaved su(4 ) group transformation that can be decomposed into a product of u(2 ) and su(2 ) group transformations . each of them may be thought of as being realized by a particular lossless four - port device . if for narrow - bandwidth radiation far from the medium resonances the absorption matrix of the four - port device can be disregarded , the well - known su(2 ) group transformation for a lossless device is recognized . explicit formulas for the transformation of fock - states and coherent states are given .
