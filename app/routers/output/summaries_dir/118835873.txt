nonlocal correlations are useful for device independent ( di ) randomness certification [ nature ( london ) { \bf 464 } , 1021 ( 2010 ) ] . the advantage of this di protocol over the conventional quantum protocol is that randomness can be certified even when experimental apparatuses are not trusted . quantum entanglement is the necessary physical source for the nonlocal correlation required for such di task . however , nonlocality and entanglement are distinct concepts . there exist entangled states which produce no nonlocal correlation and hence are not useful for the di randomness certification task . here we introduce the measurement - device - independent randomness certification task where one has trusted quantum state preparation device but the measurement devices are completely unspecified . interestingly we show that there exist entangled states , with local description , that are useful resource in such task which otherwise are useless in corresponding di scenario .
