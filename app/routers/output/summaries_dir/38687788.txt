we study three methods of obtaining an approximation of unitary evolution of a quantum system under decoherence . we use three methods of optimizing the control pulses : genetic optimization , approximate evolution method and approximate gradient method . to model the noise in the system we use the lindblad equaiton . we obtain results showing that genetic optimization may give a better approximation of a unitary evolution in the case of high noise .
