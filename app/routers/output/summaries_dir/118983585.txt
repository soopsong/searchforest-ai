entanglement between three or more parties exhibits a realm of properties unknown to two - party states . bipartite states are easily classified using the schmidt decomposition . the schmidt coefficients of a bipartite pure state encompass all the non - local properties of the state and can be"seen"by looking at one party 's density matrix only . pure states of three and more parties however lack such a simple form . they have more invariants under local unitary transformations than any one party can"see"on their sub - system . these"hidden non - localities"will allow us to exhibit a class of multipartite states that can not be distinguished from each other by any party . generalizing a result of bprst and using a recent result by nielsen we will show that these states can not be transformed into each other by local actions and classical communication . furthermore we will use an orthogonal subset of such states to hint at applications to cryptography and illustrate an extension to quantum secret sharing ( using recently suggested ( ( n , k))-threshold schemes ) .
