we developed an apparatus to couple a 50-micrometer diameter whispering - gallery silica microtoroidal resonator in a helium-4 cryostat using a straight optical tapered - fiber at 1550 nm wavelength . on a top - loading probe specifically adapted for increased mechanical stability , we use a specifically - developed"cryotaper"to optically probe the cavity , allowing thus to record the calibrated mechanical spectrum of the optomechanical system at low temperatures . we then demonstrate excellent thermalization of a 63-mhz mechanical mode of a toroidal resonator down to the cryostat 's base temperature of 1.65k , thereby proving the viability of the cryogenic refrigeration via heat conduction through static low - pressure exchange gas . in the context of optomechanics , we therefore provide a versatile and powerful tool with state - of - the - art performances in optical coupling efficiency , mechanical stability and cryogenic cooling .
