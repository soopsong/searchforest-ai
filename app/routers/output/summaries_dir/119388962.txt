we previously established that in principle , it is possible to quantum compute using passive linear optics with photo - detectors ( quant - ph/0006088 ) . here we describe techniques based on error detection and correction that greatly improve the resource and device reliability requirements needed for scalability . the resource requirements are analyzed for ideal linear optics quantum computation ( loqc ) . the coding methods can be integrated both with loss detection and phase error - correction to deal with the primary relaxation processes in non - ideal optics , including detector inefficiencies . the main conclusion of our work is that the resource requirements for implementing quantum communication or computation with loqc are reasonable . furthermore , this work clearly demonstrates how special knowledge of the error behavior can be exploited for greatly improving the fault tolerance and overheads of a physical quantum computer .
