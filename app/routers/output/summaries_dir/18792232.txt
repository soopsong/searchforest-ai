coherent controlization , i.e. , coherent conditioning of arbitrary single- or multi - qubit operations on the state of one or more control qubits , is an important ingredient for the flexible implementation of many algorithms in quantum computation . this is of particular significance when certain subroutines are changing over time or when they are frequently modified , such as in decision - making algorithms for learning agents . we propose a scheme to realize coherent controlization for any number of superconducting qubits coupled to a microwave resonator . for two and three qubits , we present an explicit construction that is of high relevance for quantum learning agents . we demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal , taking into account loss , dephasing , and the cavity self - kerr effect .
