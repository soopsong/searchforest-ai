we derive upper and lower bounds on the convergence behavior of certain classes of one - parameter quantum dynamical semigroups . the classes we consider consist of tensor product channels and of channels with commuting liouvillians . we introduce the notion of cutoff phenomenon in the setting of quantum information theory , and show how it exemplifies the fact that the convergence of ( quantum ) stochastic processes is not solely governed by the spectral gap of the transition map . we apply the new methods to show that graph states can be prepared efficiently , albeit not in constant time , by dissipation , and give the exact scaling behavior of the time to stationarity .
