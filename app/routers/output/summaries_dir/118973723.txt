atmospheric channels are a promising candidate to establish secure quantum communication on a global scale . however , due to their turbulent nature , it is crucial to understand the impact of the atmosphere on the quantum properties of light and examine it experimentally . in this paper , we introduce a method to probe atmospheric free - space links with quantum light on a laboratory scale . in contrast to previous works , our method models arbitrary intensity losses caused by turbulence to emulate general atmospheric conditions . this allows us to characterize turbulent quantum channels in a well - controlled manner . to implement this technique , we perform a series of measurements with different constant attenuations and simulate the fluctuating losses by combining the obtained data . we directly test the proposed method with an on - chip source of nonclassical light and a time - bin - multiplexed detection system . with the obtained data , we characterize the nonclassicality of the generated states for different atmospheric noise models and analyze a post - selection protocol . this general technique in atmospheric quantum optics allows for studying turbulent quantum channels and predicting their properties for future applications .
