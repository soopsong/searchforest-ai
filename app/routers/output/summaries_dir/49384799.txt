a protocol is proposed to generate bell states in two non - directly interacting qubits by means of repeated measurements of the state of a central ancilla connected to both qubits . an optimal measurement rate is found that minimizes the time to stably encode a bell state in the target qubits , being of advantage in order to reduce detrimental effects from possible interactions with the environment . the quality of the entanglement is assessed in terms of the concurrence and the distance between the qubits state and the target bell state is quantified by the fidelity .
