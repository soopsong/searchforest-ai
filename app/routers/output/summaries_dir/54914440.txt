convex polytopes are convex hulls of point sets in the $ n$-dimensional space $ \e^n$ that generalize 2-dimensional convex polygons and 3-dimensional convex polyhedra . we concentrate on the class of $ n$-dimensional polytopes in $ \e^n$ called sign permutation polytopes . we characterize sign permutation polytopes before relating their construction to constructions over the space of quantum density matrices . finally , we consider the problem of state identification and show how sign permutation polytopes may be useful in addressing issues of robustness .
