we analyze the performance of optomechanical cooling of a mechanical resonator in the presence of a degenerate optical parametric amplifier within the optomechanical cavity , which squeezes the cavity light . we demonstrate that this allows to significantly enhance the cooling efficiency via the coherent suppression of stokes scattering . the enhanced cooling occurs also far from the resolved sideband regime , and we show that this cooling scheme can be more efficient than schemes realized by injecting a squeezed field into the optomechanical cavity .
