we report on the first realization of an integrated optical memory for light based on a laser written waveguide in a doped crystal . using femto - second laser micromachining , we fabricate waveguides in pr$^{3+}$:y$_2$sio$_5 $ crystal . we demonstrate that the waveguide inscription does not affect the coherence properties of the material and that the light confinement in the waveguide increases the interaction with the active ions by a factor 6 . we also demonstrate that , analogously to the bulk crystals , we can operate the optical pumping protocols necessary to prepare the population in atomic frequency combs , that we use to demonstrate light storage in excited and spin states of the praseodymium ions . our results represent the first realization of laser written waveguides in a pr$^{3+}$:y$_2$sio$_5 $ crystal and the first implementation of an integrated on - demand spin wave optical memory . they open new perspectives for integrated quantum memories .
