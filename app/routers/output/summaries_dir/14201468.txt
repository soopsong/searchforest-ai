cold atoms coupled to photonic crystals constitute an exciting platform for exploring quantum many - body physics . here we investigate the strong coupling between atomic internal ( " spin " ) degrees of freedom and motion , which arises from spin - dependent forces associated with the exchange of guided photons . we show that this system can realize a remarkable and extreme limit of quantum spin - orbital systems , where both the direct spin exchange between neighboring sites and the kinetic energy of the orbital motion vanish . we find that this previously unexplored system has a rich phase diagram of emergent orders , including spatially dimerized spin - entangled pairs , a fluid of composite particles comprised of joint spin - phonon excitations , phonon - induced n\'eel ordering , and a fractional magnetization plateau associated with trimer formation .
