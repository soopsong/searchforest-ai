we theoretically investigate a near - quantum - limited parametric amplifier based on the nonlinear dynamics of quasiparticles flowing through a superconducting - insulator - superconducting junction . photon - assisted tunneling , resulting from the combination of dc- and ac - voltage bias , gives rise to a strong parametric interaction for the electromagnetic modes reflected by the junction coupled to a transmission line . we show phase - sensitive and phase - preserving amplification , together with single- and two - mode squeezing . for an aluminum junction pumped at twice the center frequency , $ \omega_0/2\pi=6$~ghz , we predict narrow - band phase - sensitive amplification of microwaves signals to more than 20 db , and broadband phase - preserving amplification of 20 db over a 1.2 ghz 3-db bandwidth . we also predict single- and two - mode squeezing reaching more than -12 db over 5.3 ghz 3-db bandwidth . moreover , with a simple impedance matching circuit , we demonstrate 3 db bandwidth reaching 4.3 ghz for 20 db of gain . a key feature of the device is that its performance can be controlled in - situ with the applied dc- and ac - voltage biases .
