in the control of classical mechanical systems , the feedback has been successfully applied to the production of the desired nonlinear dynamics . however , how much this can be done is still an open problem in quantum mechanical systems . this paper proposes a scheme of generating strong nonlinear quantum effects via the recently developed coherent feedback techniques , which can be shown to outperform the measurement - based quantum feedback scheme that can only generate pseudo - nonlinear quantum effects . such advancement is demonstrated by two application examples in quantum optics on chip . in the first example , we show that the nonlinear kerr effect can be generated and amplified to be comparable with the linear effect in a transmission line resonator ( tlr ) . in the second example , we show that by tuning the gains of the quantum amplifiers in a tlr coherent feedback network , non - gaussian"light"(microwave field ) can be generated and manipulated via the nonlinear effects which exhibits fully quantum sub - poisson photoncount statistics and photon antibunching phenomenon . the scheme opens promising applications in demonstrating strong nonlinear quantum optics on chip , which is extremely weak and inflexible in traditional quantum optical devices .
