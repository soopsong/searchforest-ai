we study the hawking process on lattices falling into static black holes . the motivation is to understand how the outgoing modes and hawking radiation can arise in a setting with a strict short distance cutoff in the free - fall frame . we employ two - dimensional free scalar field theory . for a falling lattice with a discrete time - translation symmetry we use analytical methods to establish that , for killing frequency $ \omega$ and surface gravity $ \kappa$ satisfying $ \kappa\ll\omega^{1/3}\ll 1 $ in lattice units , the continuum hawking spectrum is recovered . the low frequency outgoing modes arise from exotic ingoing modes with large proper wavevectors that"refract"off the horizon . in this model with time translation symmetry the proper lattice spacing goes to zero at spatial infinity . we also consider instead falling lattices whose proper lattice spacing is constant at infinity and therefore grows with time at any finite radius . this violation of time translation symmetry is visible only at wavelengths comparable to the lattice spacing , and it is responsible for transmuting ingoing high killing frequency modes into low frequency outgoing modes .
