in this report , we explore the use of a quantum optimization algorithm for obtaining low energy conformations of protein models . we discuss mappings between protein models and optimization variables , which are in turn mapped to a system of coupled quantum bits . general strategies are given for constructing hamiltonians to be used to solve optimization problems of physical / chemical / biological interest via quantum computation by adiabatic evolution . as an example , we implement the hamiltonian corresponding to the hydrophobic - polar ( hp ) model for protein folding . furthermore , we present an approach to reduce the resulting hamiltonian to two - body terms gearing towards an experimental realization .
