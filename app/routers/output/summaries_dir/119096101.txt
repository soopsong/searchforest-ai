in this paper , we measure the spectrum of light scattered by a cold atomic cloud driven by a strong laser beam . the experimental technique is based on heterodyne spectroscopy coupled to single - photon detectors and intensity correlations . at resonance , we observe the mollow triplet . this spectrum is quantitatively compared to the theoretical one , emphasizing the influence of the temperature of the cloud and the finite - size of the laser beam . off resonance measurements are also done showing a very good agreement with theory .
