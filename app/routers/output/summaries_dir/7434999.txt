we report electronic transport on n - type silicon single electron transistors ( sets ) fabricated in complementary metal oxide semiconductor ( cmos ) technology . the n - mossets are built within a pre - industrial fully depleted silicon on insulator ( fdsoi ) technology with a silicon thickness down to 10 nm on 200 mm wafers . the nominal channel size of 20 $ \times$ 20 nm$^{2}$ is obtained by employing electron beam lithography for active and gate levels patterning . the coulomb blockade stability diagram is precisely resolved at 4.2 k and it exhibits large addition energies of tens of mev . the confinement of the electrons in the quantum dot has been modeled by using a current spin density functional theory ( cs - dft ) method . cmos technology enables massive production of sets for ultimate nanoelectronics and quantum variables based devices .
