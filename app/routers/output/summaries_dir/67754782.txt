we derive necessary conditions in terms of the variances of position and momentum linear combinations for all kinds of separability of a multi - party multi - mode continuous - variable state . their violations can be sufficient for genuine multipartite entanglement , provided the combinations contain both conjugate variables of all modes . hence a complete state determination , for example by detecting the entire correlation matrix of a gaussian state , is not needed .
