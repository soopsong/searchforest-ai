we examine a two - level system coupled to a quantum oscillator , typically representing experiments in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics . we show how such a system can be treated analytically in the ultrastrong coupling limit , where the ratio $ g/\omega$ between coupling strength and oscillator frequency approaches unity and goes beyond . in this regime the jaynes - cummings model is known to fail , because counter - rotating terms have to be taken into account . by using van vleck perturbation theory to higher orders in the qubit tunneling matrix element $ \delta$ we are able to enlarge the regime of applicability of existing analytical treatments , including in particular also the finite bias case . we present a detailed discussion on the energy spectrum of the system and on the dynamics of the qubit for an oscillator at low temperature . we consider the coupling strength $ g$ to all orders , and the validity of our approach is even enhanced in the ultrastrong coupling regime . looking at the fourier spectrum of the population difference , we find that many frequencies are contributing to the dynamics . they are gathered into groups whose spacing depends on the qubit - oscillator detuning . furthermore , the dynamics is not governed anymore by a vacuum rabi splitting which scales linearly with $ g$ , but by a non - trivial dressing of the tunneling matrix element , which can be used to suppress specific frequencies through a variation of the coupling .
