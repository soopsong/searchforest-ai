information transfer rates in optical communications may be dramatically increased by making use of spatially non - gaussian states of light . here we demonstrate the ability of deep neural networks to classify numerically - generated , noisy laguerre - gauss modes of up to 100 quanta of orbital angular momentum with near - unity fidelity . the scheme relies only on the intensity profile of the detected modes , allowing for considerable simplification of current measurement schemes required to sort the states containing increasing degrees of orbital angular momentum . we also present results that show the strength of deep neural networks in the classification of experimental superpositions of laguerre - gauss modes when the networks are trained solely using simulated images . it is anticipated that these results will allow for an enhancement of current optical communications technologies .
