this paper is concerned with networks of interacting linear systems at sites of a multidimensional lattice . the systems are governed by linear odes with constant coefficients driven by external inputs , and their internal dynamics and coupling with the other component systems are translation invariant . such systems occur , for example , in finite - difference models of large - scale flexible structures manufactured from homogeneous materials . using the spatio - temporal transfer function of this translation invariant network , we establish conditions for its positive realness in the sense of energy dissipation . the latter is formulated in terms of block toeplitz bilinear forms of the input and output variables of the composite system . we also discuss quadratic stability of the network in isolation from the environment and phonon theoretic dispersion relations .
