we prove additivity of the minimal conditional entropy associated with a quantum channel phi , represented by a completely positive ( cp ) , trace - preserving map , when the infimum of s(gamma_{12 } ) - s(gamma_1 ) is restricted to states of the form gamma_{12 } = ( i \ot phi)(| psi><psi | ) . we show that this follows from multiplicativity of the completely bounded norm of phi considered as a map from l_1 ->l_p for l_p spaces defined by the schatten p - norm on matrices ; we also give an independent proof based on entropy inequalities . several related multiplicativity results are discussed and proved . in particular , we show that both the usual l_1 ->l_p norm of a cp map and the corresponding completely bounded norm are achieved for positive semi - definite matrices . physical interpretations are considered , and a new proof of strong subadditivity is presented .
