previously a new scheme of quantum information processing based on spin coherent states of two component bose - einstein condensates was proposed ( byrnes { \it et al . } phys . rev . a 85 , 40306(r ) ) . in this paper we give a more detailed exposition of the scheme , expanding on several aspects that were not discussed in full previously . the basic concept of the scheme is that spin coherent states are used instead of qubits to encode qubit information , and manipulated using collective spin operators . the scheme goes beyond the continuous variable regime such that the full space of the bloch sphere is used . we construct a general framework for quantum algorithms to be executed using multiple spin coherent states , which are individually controlled . we illustrate the scheme by applications to quantum information protocols , and discuss possible experimental implementations . decoherence effects are analyzed under both general conditions and for the experimental implementation proposed .
