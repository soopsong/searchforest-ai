we derive exceedingly simple practical procedures revealing the quantum nature of states and measurements by the violation of classical upper bounds on the statistics of arbitrary measurements . data analysis is minimum and definite conclusions are obtained without evaluation of moments , or any other more sophisticated procedures . these nonclassical tests are independent of other typical quantum signatures such as sub - poissonian statistics , quadrature squeezing , or oscillatory statistics . this approach can be equally well applied to very diverse situations such as single- and two - mode fields , observables with continuous and discrete spectra , finite- and infinite - dimensional systems , and ideal and noisy measurements .
