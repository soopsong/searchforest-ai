based on a microwave - photon quantum processor with two superconducting resonators coupled to one transmon qutrit , we construct the controlled - phase ( c - phase ) gate on microwave - photon - resonator qudits , by combination of the photon - number - dependent frequency - shift effect on the transmon qutrit by the first resonator and the resonant operation between the qutrit and the second resonator . this distinct feature provides us a useful way to achieve the c - phase gate on the two resonator qudits with a higher fidelity and a shorter operation time , compared with the previous proposals . the fidelity of our c - phase gate can reach 99.51 % within 93 ns . moreover , our device can be extended easily to construct the three - qudit gates on three resonator qudits , far different from the existing proposals . our controlled - controlled - phase gate on three resonator qudits is accomplished with the assistance of a transmon qutrit and its fidelity can reach 92.92 % within 124.64 ns .
