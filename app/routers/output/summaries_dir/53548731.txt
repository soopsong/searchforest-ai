we study how an optical parametric amplifier inside the cavity can affect the normal mode splitting behavior of the coupled movable mirror and the cavity field . we work in the resolved sideband regime . the spectra exhibit a double - peak structure as the parametric gain is increased . moreover , for a fixed parametric gain , the double - peak structure of the spectrum is more pronounced with increasing the input laser power . we give results for mode splitting . the widths of the split lines are sensitive to parametric gain .
