multi - qubit quantum rabi model , which is a fundamental model describing light - matter interaction , plays an important role in various physical systems . in this paper , we propose a theoretical method to simulate multi - qubit quantum rabi model in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system . by means of external transversal and longitudinal driving fields , an effective hamiltonian describing the multi - qubit quantum rabi model is derived . the effective frequency of the resonator and the effective splitting of the qubits depend on the external driving fields . by adjusting the frequencies and the amplitudes of the driving fields , the stronger coupling regimes could be reached . the numerical simulation shows that our proposal works well in a wide range of parameter space . moreover , our scheme can be utilized to generate two - qubit gate , schr\"odinger states , and multi - qubit ghz states . the maximum displacement of the schr\"odinger cat states can be enhanced by increasing the number of the qubits and the relative coupling strength . it should be mention that we can obtain high fidelity schr\"odinger cat states and multi - qubit ghz states even the system suffering dissipation . the presented proposal may open a way to study the stronger coupling regimes whose coupling strength is far away from ultrastrong coupling regimes .
