we introduce a general method of gluing multi - partite states and show that entanglement swapping is a special class of a wider range of gluing operations . the gluing operation of two m and n qudit states consists of an entangling operation on two given qudits of the the two states followed by operations of measurements of the two qudits in the computational basis . depending on how many qudits ( two , one or zero ) we measure , we have three classes of gluing operation , resulting respectively in m+n-2 , m+n-1 or m+n qudit states . entanglement swapping belongs to the first class and has been widely studied , while the other two classes are presented and studied here . in particular we study how larger ghz and w states can be constructed when we glue the smaller ghz and w states by the second method . finally we prove that when we glue two states by the third method , the k - uniformity of the states is preserved . that is when a k - uniform state of m qudits is glued to a k'-uniform state of n qudits , the resulting state will be a min(k , k')-uniform of m+n qudits .
