a key goal of quantum chaos is to establish a relationship between widely observed universal spectral fluctuations of clean quantum systems and random matrix theory ( rmt ) . for single particle systems with fully chaotic classical counterparts , the problem has been partly solved by berry ( 1985 ) within the so - called diagonal approximation of semiclassical periodic - orbit sums . derivation of the full rmt spectral form factor $ k(t)$ from semiclassics has been completed only much later in a tour de force by mueller et al ( 2004 ) . in recent years , the questions of long - time dynamics at high energies , for which the full many - body energy spectrum becomes relevant , are coming at the forefront even for simple many - body quantum systems , such as locally interacting spin chains . such systems display two universal types of behaviour which are termed as ` many - body localized phase ' and ` ergodic phase ' . in the ergodic phase , the spectral fluctuations are excellently described by rmt , even for very simple interactions and in the absence of any external source of disorder . here we provide the first theoretical explanation for these observations . we compute $ k(t)$ explicitly in the leading two orders in $ t$ and show its agreement with rmt for non - integrable , time - reversal invariant many - body systems without classical counterparts , a generic example of which are ising spin 1/2 models in a periodically kicking transverse field .
