we develop several algorithms for performing quantum phase estimation based on basic measurements and classical post - processing . we present a pedagogical review of quantum phase estimation and simulate the algorithm to numerically determine its scaling in circuit depth and width . we show that the use of purely random measurements requires a number of measurements that is optimal up to constant factors , albeit at the cost of exponential classical post - processing ; the method can also be used to improve classical signal processing . we then develop a quantum algorithm for phase estimation that yields an asymptotic improvement in runtime , coming within a factor of log * of the minimum number of measurements required while still requiring only minimal classical post - processing . the corresponding quantum circuit requires asymptotically lower depth and width ( number of qubits ) than quantum phase estimation .
