in quantum information science , the external control of qubits must be balanced with the extreme isolation of the qubits from the environment . atomic qubit systems typically mitigate this balance through the use of gated laser fields that can create superpositions and entanglement between qubits . here we propose the use of high - order optical stark shifts from optical fields to manipulate the splitting of atomic qubits that are insensitive to other types of fields . we demonstrate a fourth - order ac stark shift in a trapped atomic ion system that does not require extra laser power beyond that needed for other control fields . we individually address a chain of tightly - spaced trapped ions and show how these controlled shifts can produce an arbitrary product state of ten ions as well as generate site - specific magnetic field terms in a simulated spin hamiltonian .
