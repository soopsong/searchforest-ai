one of the most important questions in studying quantum computation is : whether a quantum computer can solve np - complete problems more efficiently than a classical computer ? in 2000 , farhi , et al . ( science , 292(5516):472 - -476 , 2001 ) proposed the adiabatic quantum optimization ( aqo ) , a paradigm that directly attacks np - hard optimization problems . how powerful is aqo ? early on , van dam and vazirani claimed that aqo failed ( i.e. would take exponential time ) for a family of 3sat instances they constructed . more recently , altshuler , et al . ( proc natl acad sci usa , 107(28 ) : 12446 - -12450 , 2010 ) claimed that aqo failed also for random instances of the np - complete exact cover problem . in this paper , we make clear that all these negative results are only for a specific aqo algorithm . we do so by demonstrating different aqo algorithms for the same problem for which their arguments no longer hold . whether aqo fails or succeeds for solving the np - complete problems ( either the worst case or the average case ) requires further investigation . our aqo algorithms for exact cover and 3sat are based on the polynomial reductions to the np - complete maximum - weight independent set ( mis ) problem .
