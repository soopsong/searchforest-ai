optomechanical arrays made of structured flexible dielectrics are a promising system for exploring quantum and many - body optomechanical phenomena . we generalize investigations of the optomechanical properties of periodic arrays of one - dimensional scatterers in optical resonators to the case of vibrating membranes whose thickness is not necessarily small with respect to the optical wavelength of interest . the array optical transmission spectrum and its optomechanical coupling with a linear fabry - perot cavity field are investigated both analytically and numerically .
