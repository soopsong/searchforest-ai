this paper considers basic properties of super - operator norms induced by schatten p - norms . such super - operator norms arise in various contexts in the study of quantum information . it is proved that for completely positive super - operators , the value of any such norm is achieved by a positive semidefinite input , answering a question recently posed by king and ruskai . however , for any choice of p , there exists a super - operator that is the difference of two completely positive , trace - preserving super - operators such that the value of the super - operator norm is not even achieved on a hermitian input operator . also considered are the properties of the above norms for super - operators tensored with the identity super - operator .
