in this paper i explore the entanglement evolution of qubits that are part of a five qubit quantum error correction code subject to various decohering environments . specifically , i look for possible parallels between the entanglement degradation and the fidelity of the logical qubit of quantum information stored in the physical qubits . in addition , i note the possible exhibition of entanglement sudden death ( esd ) due to decoherence and question whether esd is actually a roadblock to successful quantum computation .
