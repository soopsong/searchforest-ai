the equivalence of thermodynamic ensembles is at the heart of statistical mechanics and central to our understanding of equilibrium states of matter . recently , it has been shown that there is a formal connection between the dynamics of open quantum systems and the statistical mechanics in an extra dimension . this is established through the fact that an open system dynamics generates a matrix product state ( mps ) which encodes the set of all possible quantum jump trajectories and permits the construction of generating functions in the spirit of thermodynamic partition functions . in the case of continuous - time markovian evolution , such as that generated by a lindblad master equation , the corresponding mps is a so - called continuous mps which encodes the set of continuous measurement records terminated at some fixed total observation time . here we show that if one instead terminates trajectories after a fixed total number of quantum jumps , e.g. emission events into the environment , the associated mps is discrete . this establishes an interesting analogy : the continuous and discrete mps correspond to different ensembles of quantum trajectories , one characterised by total time the other by total number of quantum jumps . hence they give rise to quantum versions of different thermodynamic ensembles , akin to"grand - canonical"and"isobaric " , but for trajectories . here we prove that these trajectory ensembles are equivalent in a suitable limit of long time or large number of jumps . this is in direct analogy to equilibrium statistical mechanics where equivalence between ensembles is only strictly established in the thermodynamic limit . an intrinsic quantum feature is that the equivalence holds only for all observables that commute with the number of quantum jumps .
