we consider a coherent - classical estimation scheme for a class of linear quantum systems . it comprises an estimator that is a mixed quantum - classical system without involving coherent feedback . the estimator yields a classical estimate of a variable for the quantum plant . we demonstrate that for a passive plant that can be characterized by annihilation operators only , such coherent - classical estimation provides no improvement over purely - classical estimation . an example is also given which shows that if the plant is not assumed to be an annihilation operator only quantum system , it is possible to get better estimates with such coherent - classical estimation compared with purely - classical estimation .
