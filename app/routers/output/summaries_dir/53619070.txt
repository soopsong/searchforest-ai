we present an extension of the canonical coupled mode theory of electromagnetic waves to the case of pulses and spatio - temporal perturbations in complex media . unlike previous attempts to derive such a model , our approach involves no approximation , and does not impose any restriction on the spatio - temporal profile . moreover , the effect of modal dispersion on mode evolution and on the coupling to other modes is fully taken into account . thus , our approach can yield any required accuracy by retaining as many terms in the expansion as needed . it also avoids various artifacts of previous derivations by introducing the correct form of the solution . we then provide what is , to the best of our knowledge , the first ever validation of the coupled mode equations with exact numerical simulations , and demonstrate the wide range of possibilities enabled by spatio - temporal perturbations of pulses , including pulse shortening or broadening or more complex shaping . our formulation is valid across the electromagnetic spectrum , and can be applied directly also to other wave systems .
