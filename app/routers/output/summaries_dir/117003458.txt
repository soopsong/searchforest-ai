nonclassicality of a single - mode field is equivalent to the rank of two - mode entanglement this field generates at the output of a beam - splitter [ phys . rev . a 89 , 052302 ( 2014 ) ] . we derive a measure for the nonclassicality of a single - mode field using the two - mode inseparability measure of simon - peres - horodecki . degree of the single - mode nonclassicality requires the knowledge of only $ \langle \hat{a}^2\rangle$ and $ \langle\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}\rangle$. this condition / measure is both a necessary and sufficient condition for gaussian single - mode states . we show that this measure increases with squeezing strength and display a jump at the critical coupling for a superradiant phase transition . additionally , we derive a simple analytical condition , $ |\langle \hat{a}^2\rangle|>\langle\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}\rangle$ , for nonclassicality from duan - giedke - cirac - zoller criterion . in a forthcoming study , we use the derived measure to show the following . non - causal linear optical response of an optomechanical cavity emerges at the same critical cavity - mechanical coupling where output field becomes nonclassical .
