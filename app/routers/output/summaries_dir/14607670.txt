we propose a quantum processor for the scalable quantum computation on microwave photons in distant one - dimensional superconducting resonators . it is composed of a common resonator r acting as a quantum bus and some distant resonators $ r_j$ coupled to the bus in different positions assisted by superconducting quantum interferometer devices ( squid ) , different from previous processors . r is coupled to one transmon qutrit , and the coupling strengths between $ r_j$ and r can be fully tuned by the external flux through the squid . to show the processor can be used to achieve universal quantum computation effectively , we present a scheme to complete the high - fidelity quantum state transfer between two distant microwave - photon resonators and another one for the high - fidelity controlled - phase gate on them . by using the technique for catching and releasing the microwave photons from resonators , our processor may play an important role in quantum communication as well .
