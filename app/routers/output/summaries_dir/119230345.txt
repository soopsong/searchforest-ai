we propose a spectrometric method to detect a classical weak force acting upon the moving end mirror in a cavity optomechanical system . the force changes the equilibrium position of the mirror , and thus the resonance frequency of the cavity field depends on the force to be detected . as a result , the magnitude of the force can be inferred by analyzing the single - photon emission and scattering spectra of the optomechanical cavity . since the emission and scattering processes are much faster than the characteristic mechanical dissipation , the influence of the mechanical thermal noise is negligible in this spectrometric detection scheme . we also extent this spectrometric method to detect a monochromatic oscillating force by utilizing an optomechanical coupling modulated at the same frequency as the force .
