we introduce a novel time - frequency quantum key distribution ( tfqkd ) scheme based on photon pairs entangled in these two conjugate degrees of freedom . the scheme uses spectral detection and phase modulation to enable measurements in the temporal basis by means of time - to - frequency conversion . this allows large - alphabet encoding to be implemented with realistic components . a general security analysis for tfqkd with binned measurements reveals a close connection with finite - dimensional qkd protocols and enables analysis of the effects of dark counts on the secure key size .
