we investigate the structure of smooth and horizonless microstate geometries in six dimensions , in the spirit of the five - dimensional analysis of gibbons and warner [ arxiv:1305.0957 ] . in six dimensions , which is the natural setting for horizonless geometries with the charges of the d1-d5-p black hole , the natural black objects are strings and there are no chern - simons terms for the tensor gauge fields . however , we still find that the same reasoning applies : in absence of horizons , there can be no smooth stationary solutions without non - trivial topology . we use topological arguments to describe the smarr formula in various examples : the uplift of the five - dimensional minimal supergravity microstates to six dimensions , the two - charge d1-d5 microstates , and the non - extremal jmart solution . we also discuss d1-d5-p superstrata and confirm that the smarr formula gives the same result as for the d1-d5 supertubes which are topologically equivalent .
