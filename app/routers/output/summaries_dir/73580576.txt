with the purpose of controlling the steady state of a dielectric nanosphere levitated within an optical cavity , we study its conditional dynamics under simultaneous sideband cooling and additional time - continuous measurement of either the output cavity mode or the nanosphere 's position . we find that the average phonon number , purity and quantum squeezing of the steady - states can all be made more non - classical through the addition of time - continuous measurement . we predict that the continuous monitoring of the system , together with markovian feedback , allows one to stabilize the dynamics for any value of the laser frequency driving the cavity . by considering state - of - the - art values of the experimental parameters , we prove that one can in principle obtain a non - classical ( squeezed ) steady - state with an average phonon number $ n_{\sf ph}\approx 0.5$.
