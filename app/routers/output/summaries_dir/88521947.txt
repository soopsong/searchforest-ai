quantum - enhanced metrology aims to estimate an unknown parameter such that the precision scales better than the shot - noise bound . single - shot adaptive quantum - enhanced metrology ( aqem ) is a promising approach that uses feedback to tweak the quantum process according to previous measurement outcomes . techniques and formalism for the adaptive case are quite different from the usual non - adaptive quantum metrology approach due to the causal relationship between measurements and outcomes . we construct a formal framework for aqem by modeling the procedure as a decision - making process , and we derive the imprecision and the cram\'{e}r - rao lower bound with explicit dependence on the feedback policy . we also explain the reinforcement learning approach for generating quantum control policies , which is adopted due to the optimal policy being non - trivial to devise . applying a learning algorithm based on differential evolution enables us to attain imprecision for adaptive interferometric phase estimation , which turns out to be sql when non - entangled particles are used in the scheme .
