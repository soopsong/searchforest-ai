we study the entanglement contour , a quasi - local measure of entanglement , and propose a generic formula for the contour in 1 + 1d quantum systems . we use this formalism to investigate the real space entanglement structure of various static cfts as well as local and global quantum quenches . the global quench elucidates the spatial distribution of entanglement entropy in strongly interacting cfts and clarifies the interpretation of the entanglement tsunami picture . the entanglement tsunami effectively characterizes the non - local growth of entanglement entropy while the contour characterizes the local propagation of entanglement . we generalize the formula for the entanglement contour to arbitrary dimensions and entangling surface geometries using bit threads , and are able to realize a holographic contour for logarithmic negativity and the entanglement of purification by restricting the bulk spacetime to the entanglement wedge . furthermore , we explore the connections between the entanglement contour , bit threads , and entanglement density in kinematic space .
