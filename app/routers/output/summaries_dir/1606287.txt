the hitting time of a classical random walk ( markov chain ) is the time required to detect the presence of — or equivalently , to find — a marked state . the hitting time of a quantum walk is subtler to define ; in particular , it is unknown whether the detection and finding problems have the same time complexity . in this paper we define new monte carlo type classical and quantum hitting times , and we prove several relationships among these and the already existing las vegas type definitions . in particular , we show that for some marked state the two types of hitting time are of the same order in both the classical and the quantum case . then , we present new quantum algorithms for the detection and finding problems . the complexities of both algorithms are related to the new , potentially smaller , quantum hitting times . the detection algorithm is based on phase estimation and is particularly simple . the finding algorithm combines a similar phase estimation based procedure with ideas of tulsi from his recent theorem ( tulsi a. : phys . rev . a 78:012310 2008 ) for the 2d grid . extending his result , we show that we can find a unique marked element with constant probability and with the same complexity as detection for a large class of quantum walks — the quantum analogue of state - transitive reversible ergodic markov chains . further , we prove that for any reversible ergodic markov chain p , the quantum hitting time of the quantum analogue of p has the same order as the square root of the classical hitting time of p. we also investigate the ( im)possibility of achieving a gap greater than quadratic using an alternative quantum walk . in doing so , we define a notion of reversibility for a broad class of quantum walks and show how to derive from any such quantum walk a classical analogue . for the special case of quantum walks built on reflections , we show that the hitting time of the classical analogue is exactly the square of the quantum walk .
