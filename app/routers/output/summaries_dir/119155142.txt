we consider a two - level system such as a two - level atom , interacting with a cavity field mode in the rotating wave approximation , when the atomic transition frequency or the field mode frequency is periodically driven in time . we show that in both cases , for an appropriate choice of the modulation parameters , the state amplitudes in a generic $ n${-}excitation subspace obey the same equations of motion that can be obtained from a \emph{static } non - hermitian jaynes - cummings hamiltonian with $ { \mathcal pt}$ symmetry , that is with an imaginary coupling constant . this gives further support to recent results showing the possible physical interest of $ { \mathcal pt}$ symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonians . we also generalize the well - known diagonalization of the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian to the non - hermitian case in terms of pseudo - bosons and pseudo - fermions , and discuss relevant mathematical and physical aspects .
