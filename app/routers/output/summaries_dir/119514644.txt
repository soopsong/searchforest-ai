we use microwave radiation generated by a semiconductor double quantum dot ( dqd ) micromaser for charge state detection . a cavity is populated with n_c ~ 6000 photons by driving a current through an emitter dqd . these photons are used to sense the charge state of a target dqd that is located at the opposite end of the cavity . charge dynamics in the target dqd influence the output power and emission frequency of the maser . three different readout mechanisms are compared . the detection scheme requires no cavity input field and may potentially be used to improve the scalability of semiconductor and superconducting qubit readout technologies .
