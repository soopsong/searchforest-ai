recently , braunstein et al . [ 1 ] introduced normalized laplacian matrices of graphs as density matrices in quantum mechanics and studied the relationships between quantum physical properties and graph theoretical properties of the underlying graphs . we provide further results on the multipartite separability of laplacian matrices of graphs . in particular , we identify complete bipartite graphs whose normalized laplacian matrix is multipartite entangled under any vertex labeling . furthermore , we give conditions on the vertex degrees such that there is a vertex labeling under which the normalized laplacian matrix is entangled . these results address an open question raised in [ 1 ] . finally , we extend some of the results in [ 1,2 ] to the multipartite case and show that the laplacian matrix of any product of graphs ( strong , cartesian , tensor , categorical , etc . ) is multipartite separable .
