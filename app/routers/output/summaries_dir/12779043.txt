closed timelike curves are among the most controversial features of modern physics . as legitimate solutions to einstein 's field equations , they allow for time travel , which instinctively seems paradoxical . however , in the quantum regime these paradoxes can be resolved leaving closed timelike curves consistent with relativity . the study of these systems therefore provides valuable insight into non - linearities and the emergence of causal structures in quantum mechanics - essential for any formulation of a quantum theory of gravity . here we experimentally simulate the non - linear behaviour of a qubit interacting unitarily with an older version of itself , addressing some of the fascinating effects that arise in systems traversing a closed timelike curve . these include perfect discrimination of non - orthogonal states and , most intriguingly , the ability to distinguish nominally equivalent ways of preparing pure quantum states . finally , we examine the dependence of these effects on the initial qubit state , the form of the unitary interaction , and the influence of decoherence .
