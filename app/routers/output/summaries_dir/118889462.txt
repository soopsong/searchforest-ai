cooperative scattering in cold atoms has gained renewed interest , in particular in the context of single - photon superradiance , with the recent experimental observation of super - and subradiance in dilute atomic clouds . numerical simulations to support experimental signatures of cooperative scattering are often limited by the number of dipoles which can be treated , well below the number of atoms in the experiments . in this paper , we provide systematic numerical studies aimed at matching the regime of dilute atomic clouds . we use a scalar coupled - dipole model in the low excitation limit and an exclusion volume to avoid density - related effects . scaling laws for super - and subradiance are obtained and the limits of numerical studies are pointed out . we also illustrate the cooperative nature of light scattering by considering an incident laser field , where half of the beam has a $ \pi$ phase shift . the enhanced subradiance obtained under such condition provides an additional signature of the role of coherence in the detected signal .
