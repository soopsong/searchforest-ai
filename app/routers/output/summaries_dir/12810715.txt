there have been a number of attempts to derive the set of quantum non - local correlations from reasonable physical principles . here we introduce $ \tilde{q}$ , a set of multipartite supra - quantum correlations that has appeared under different names in fields as diverse as graph theory , quantum gravity and quantum information science . we argue that $ \tilde{q}$ may correspond to the set of correlations of a reasonable physical theory , in which case the research program to reconstruct quantum theory from device - independent principles is met with strong obstacles . in support of this conjecture , we prove that $ \tilde{q}$ is closed under classical operations and satisfies the physical principles of non - trivial communication complexity , no advantage for nonlocal computation , macroscopic locality and local orthogonality . we also review numerical evidence that almost quantum correlations satisfy information causality .
