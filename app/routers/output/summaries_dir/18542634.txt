quantum information processors need to be protected against errors and faults . one of the most widely considered fault - tolerant architecture is based on surface codes . while the general principles of these codes are well understood and basic code properties such as minimum distance and rate are easy to characterize , a code 's average performance depends on the detailed geometric layout of the qubits . to date , optimizing a surface code architecture and comparing different geometric layouts relies on costly numerical simulations . here , we propose a benchmarking algorithm for simulating the performance of surface codes , and generalizations thereof , that runs in linear time . we implemented this algorithm in a software that generates performance reports and allows to quickly compare different architectures .
