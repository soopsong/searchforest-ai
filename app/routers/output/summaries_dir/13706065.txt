the three - electron configuration of gate - defined double quantum dots encodes a promising qubit for quantum information processing . i propose a two - qubit entangling gate using a pulse - gated manipulation procedure . the requirements for high - fidelity entangling operations are equivalent to the requirements for the pulse - gated single - qubit manipulations that have been successfully realized for si qds . this two - qubit gate completes the universal set of all - pulse - gated operations for the three - electron double - dot qubit and paves the way for a scalable setup to achieve quantum computation .
