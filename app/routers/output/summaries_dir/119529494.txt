a bell test separates quantum mechanics from a classical , local realist theory of physics . however , a bell test can not separate quantum physics from all classical theories . classical devices supplemented with non - signaling correlations , e.g. , the popescu - rohrlich"nonlocal box,"can pass a bell test with probability at least as high as any quantum devices can . after all , quantum entanglement does not allow for signaling faster than the speed of light , so in a sense is a weaker special case of non - signaling correlations . it could be that underneath quantum mechanics is a deeper non - signaling theory . we present a test to separate quantum theory from powerful non - signaling theories . the test extends the chsh game to involve three space - like separated devices . quantum devices sharing a three - qubit ghz state can pass the test with probability 5.1 % higher than classical devices sharing arbitrary non - signaling correlations between pairs . more generally , we give a test that k space - like separated quantum devices can pass with higher probability than classical devices sharing arbitrary ( k-1)-local non - signaling correlations .
