quantum annealing aims to solve combinatorial optimization problems mapped on to ising interactions between quantum spins . a critical factor that limits the success of a quantum annealer is its sensitivity to noise , and intensive research is consequently focussed towards developing noise - resilient annealers . here we propose a new paradigm for quantum annealing with a scalable network of all - to - all connected , two - photon driven kerr - nonlinear resonators . each of these resonators encode an ising spin in a robust degenerate subspace formed by two coherent states of opposite phases . the fully - connected optimization problem is mapped onto local fields driving the resonators , which are themselves connected by local four - body interactions . we describe an adiabatic annealing protocol in this system and analyze its performance in the presence of photon loss . numerical simulations indicate substantial resilience to this noise channel , making it a promising platform for implementing a large scale quantum ising machine . finally , we propose a realistic implementation of this scheme in circuit qed .
