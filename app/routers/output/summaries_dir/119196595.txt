we theoretically propose a photonic flash based on a linearly coupled cavity system . via driving the two side cavities by external fields , it forms a cyclic energy - level diagram and therefore the phase difference between the driving fields acts as a controller of the steady state due to the quantum interference effect . in the optical trimer structure , we show that the perfect photonic flash can be realized in the situation of resonant driving . the perfect photonic flash scheme is furthermore generalized to multiple coupled cavity system , where the cavities with odd and even number turn bright and dark alternatively . { our proposal may be applied in the designing of quantum neon and realizing a controllable photonic localization .
