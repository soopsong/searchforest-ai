in this paper we address the question : to what extent is the quantum state preparation of multiatom clusters ( before they are injected into the microwave cavity ) instrumental for determining not only the kind of machine we may operate but also the quantitative bounds of its performance ? figuratively speaking , if the multiatom cluster is the"crude oil " , the question is : which preparation of the cluster is the refining process that can deliver a"gasoline"with a"specific octane " ? we classify coherences or quantum correlations among the atoms according to their ability to serve as ( i ) fuel for nonthermal machines corresponding to atomic states whose coherences displace or squeeze the cavity field , as well as cause its heating ; and ( ii ) fuel which is purely"combustible " , i.e. , corresponds to atomic states that only allow for heat and entropy exchange with the field and can energize a proper heat engine . we identify highly promising multiatom states for each kind of fuel and propose viable experimental schemes for their implementation .
