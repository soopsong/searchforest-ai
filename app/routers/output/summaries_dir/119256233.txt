we compute holographic r\'enyi entropies for spherical entangling surfaces on the boundary while considering third order lovelock gravity with negative cosmological constant in the bulk . our study shows that third order lovelock black holes with hyperbolic event horizon are unstable , and at low temperatures those with smaller mass are favoured , giving rise to first order phase transitions in the bulk . we determine regions in the lovelock parameter space in arbitrary dimensions , where bulk phase transitions happen and where boundary causality constraints are met . we show that each of these points corresponds to a dual boundary conformal field theory whose r\'enyi entropy exhibits a kink at a certain critical index $ n$.
