we found analytically a first order quantum phase transition in the cooper pair box array of $ n$ low - capacitance josephson junctions capacitively coupled to a resonant photon in a microwave cavity . the hamiltonian of the system maps on the extended dicke hamiltonian of $ n$ spins one - half with infinitely coordinated antiferromagnetic ( frustrating ) interaction . this interaction arises from the gauge - invariant coupling of the josephson junctions phases to the vector potential of the resonant photon field . in $ n \gg 1 $ semiclassical limit , we found a critical coupling at which ground state of the system switches to the one with a net collective electric dipole moment of the cooper pair boxes coupled to superradiant equilibrium photonic condensate . this phase transition changes from the first to second order if the frustrating interaction is switched off . a self - consistently ` rotating ' holstein - primakoff representation for the cartesian components of the total superspin is proposed , that enables to trace both the first and the second order quantum phase transitions in the extended and standard dicke models respectively .
