we introduce a simple optical gate to fuse arbitrary size polarization entangled w - states to prepare larger w - states . the gate requires a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) , a half wave plate ( hwp ) and two photon detectors . we study numerically and analytically the necessary resource consumption for preparing larger w - states by fusing smaller ones with the proposed fusion gate . we show analytically that resource requirement scales at most sub - exponentially with the increasing size of the state to be prepared . we numerically determine the resource cost for fusion without recycling where w - states of arbitrary size can be optimally prepared . moreover , we introduce another strategy which is based on recycling and outperforms the optimal strategy for non - recycling case .
