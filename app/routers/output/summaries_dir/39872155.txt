we analyze the steady - state energy transfer in a chain of coupled two - level systems connecting two thermal reservoirs . through an analytic treatment we find that the energy current is independent of the system size , hence violating fourier 's law of heat conduction . the classical diffusive behavior in fourier 's law of heat conduction can be recovered by introducing decoherence to the quantum systems constituting the chain . implications of these results on energy transfer in biological light harvesting systems , and the role of quantum coherences and entanglement are discussed .
