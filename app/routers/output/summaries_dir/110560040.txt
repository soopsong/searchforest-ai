continuous - variable quantum key distribution protocols , based on gaussian modulation of the quadratures of coherent states , have been implemented in recent experiments . a present limitation of such systems is the finite efficiency of the detectors , which can in principle be compensated for by the use of classical optical preamplifiers . here we study this possibility in detail , by deriving the modified secret key generation rates when an optical parametric amplifier is placed at the output of the quantum channel . after presenting a general set of security proofs , we show that the use of preamplifiers does compensate for all the imperfections of the detectors when the amplifier is optimal in terms of gain and noise . imperfect amplifiers can also enhance the system performance , under conditions which are generally satisfied in practice .
