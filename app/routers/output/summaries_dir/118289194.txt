in this work we study the relation between the set of symmetric operators and the set of mutually unbiased operators from finite plane geometry point of view . here symmetric operators are generalization of symmetric informationally complete probability - operator measurements ( sic poms ) , while mutually unbiased operators are the operator generalization of mutually unbiased bases ( mub ) . we also discuss the implication of this relation to the particular cases of rank-1 sic poms and mub .
