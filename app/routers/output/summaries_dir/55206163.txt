inseparability criteria for continuous and discrete bipartite quantum states based on moments of annihilation and creation operators are studied by developing the idea of shchukin - vogel criterion [ phys . rev . lett . { \bf 95 } , 230502 ( 2005 ) ] . if a state is separable , then the corresponding matrix of moments is separable too . thus , we derive generalized criteria , based on the separability properties of the matrix of moments , are thus derived . in particular , a new criterion based on realignment of moments in the matrix is proposed as an analogue of the standard realignment criterion for density matrices . other inseparability inequalities are obtained by applying positive maps to the matrix of moments . usefulness of the shchukin - vogel criterion to describe bipartite - entanglement of more than two modes is demonstrated : we obtain some previously known three - mode inseparability criteria originally derived from the cauchy - schwarz inequality , and we introduce new ones .
