a sort of planar tensor networks with tensor constraints is investigated as a model for holography . we study the greedy algorithm generated by tensor constraints and propose the notion of critical protection ( cp ) against the action of greedy algorithm . for given tensor constraints , a cp tensor chain can be defined . we further find that the ability of quantum error correction ( qec ) , the non - flatness of entanglement spectrum ( es ) and the correlation function can be quantitatively evaluated by the geometric structure of cp tensor chain . four classes of tensor networks with different properties of entanglement is discussed . thanks to tensor constraints and cp , the correlation function is reduced into a bracket of matrix production state and the result agrees with the one in conformal field theory .
