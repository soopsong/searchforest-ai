we present a stochastic theory for the nonequilibrium dynamics of charges moving in a quantum scalar field based on the worldline influence functional and the close - time - path ( ctp or in - in ) coarse - grained effective action method . we summarize ( 1 ) the steps leading to a derivation of a modified abraham - lorentz - dirac equation whose solutions describe a causal semiclassical theory free of runaway solutions and without pre - acceleration patholigies , and ( 2 ) the transformation to a stochastic effective action which generates abraham - lorentz - dirac - langevin equations depicting the fluctuations of a particle 's worldline around its semiclassical trajectory . we point out the misconceptions in trying to directly relate radiation reaction to vacuum fluctuations , and discuss how , in the framework that we have developed , an array of phenomena , from classical radiation and radiation reaction to the unruh effect , are interrelated to each other as manifestations at the classical , stochastic and quantum levels . using this method we give a derivation of the unruh effect for the spacetime worldline coordinates of an accelerating charge . our stochastic particle - field model , which was inspired by earlier work in cosmological backreaction , can be used as an analog to the black hole backreaction problem describing the stochastic dynamics of a black hole event horizon .
