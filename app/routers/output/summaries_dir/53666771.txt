a notion of monitored recurrence for discrete - time quantum processes was recently introduced in [ commun . math . phys . , doi 10.1007 / s00220 - 012 - 1645 - 2 ] ( see also arxiv:1202.3903 ) taking the initial state as an absorbing one . we extend this notion of monitored recurrence to absorbing subspaces of arbitrary finite dimension . the generating function approach leads to a connection with the well - known theory of operator - valued schur functions . this is the cornerstone of a spectral characterization of subspace recurrence that generalizes some of the main results in the above mentioned paper . the spectral decomposition of the unitary step operator driving the evolution yields a spectral measure , which we project onto the subspace to obtain a new spectral measure that is purely singular iff the subspace is recurrent , and consists of a pure point spectrum with a finite number of masses precisely when all states in the subspace have a finite expected return time . this notion of subspace recurrence also links the concept of expected return time to an aharonov - anandan phase that , in contrast to the case of state recurrence , can be non - integer . even more surprising is the fact that averaging such geometrical phases over the absorbing subspace yields an integer with a topological meaning , so that the averaged expected return time is always a rational number . moreover , state recurrence can occasionally give higher return probabilities than subspace recurrence , a fact that reveals once more the counterintuitive behavior of quantum systems . all these phenomena are illustrated with explicit examples , including as a natural application the analysis of site recurrence for coined walks .
