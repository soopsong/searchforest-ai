we introduce an approach which allows a detailed structural and quantitative analysis of multipartite entanglement . the sets of states with different structures are convex and nested . hence , they can be distinguished from each other using appropriate measurable witnesses . we derive equations for the construction of optimal witnesses and discuss general properties arising from our approach . as an example , we formulate witnesses for a 4-cluster state and perform a full quantitative analysis of the entanglement structure in the presence of noise and losses . the strength of the method in multimode continuous variable systems is also demonstrated by considering a dephased ghz - type state .
