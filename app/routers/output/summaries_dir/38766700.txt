we propose an experiment to create and verify entanglement between remote mechanical objects by use of an optomechanical interferometer . two optical cavities , each coupled to a separate mechanical oscillator , are coherently driven such that the oscillators are laser cooled to the quantum regime . the entanglement is induced by optical measurement and comes about by combining the output from the two cavities to erase which - path information . it can be verified through measurements of degrees of second - order coherence of the optical output field . the experiment is feasible in the regime of weak optomechanical coupling . realistic parameters for the membrane - in - the - middle geometry suggest entangled state lifetimes on the order of milliseconds .
