we present a scheme for encoding and decoding an unknown state for css codes , based on syndrome measurements . we illustrate our method by means of kitaev toric code , defected - lattice code , topological subsystem code and haah 3d code . the protocol is local whenever in a given code the crossings between the logical operators consist of next neighbour pairs , which holds for the above codes . for subsystem code we also present scheme in a noisy case , where we allow for bit and phase - flip errors on qubits as well as state preparation and syndrome measurement errors . similar scheme can be built for two other codes . we show that the fidelity of the protected qubit in the noisy scenario in a large code size limit is of $ 1-\mathcal{o}(p)$ , where $ p$ is a probability of error on a single qubit . regarding haah code we provide noiseless scheme , leaving the noisy case as an open problem .
