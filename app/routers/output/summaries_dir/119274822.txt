in this paper , we examine and compare two fundamentally different teleportation schemes ; the well - known continuous variable scheme by vaidman , braunstein and kimble ( vbk ) , and a recently proposed hybrid scheme by andersen and ralph ( ar ) . we analyze the teleportation of ensembles of arbitrary pure single - mode gaussian states using these schemes and see how they fare against the optimal measure - and - prepare strategies -- the benchmarks . in the vbk case , we allow for non - unit gain tuning and consider a class of possibly non - gaussian resources in order to optimize performance . the results suggest that the ar scheme may likely be a more suitable candidate for beating the benchmarks in the teleportation of squeezing , capable of achieving this for moderate resources in comparison to the vbk scheme . moreover , our quantification of resources , whereby different protocols are compared at fixed values of the entanglement entropy or the mean energy of the resource states , brings into question any advantage due to non - gaussianity for quantum teleportation of gaussian states .
