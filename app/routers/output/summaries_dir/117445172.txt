the symmetries associated with discrete - time quantum walks ( dtqws ) and the flexibilities in controlling their dynamical parameters allow to create a large number of topological phases . an interface in position space , which separates two regions with different topological numbers , can , for example , be effectively modelled using different coin parameters for the walk on either side of the interface . depending on the neighbouring numbers , this can lead to localized states in one - dimensional configurations and here we carry out a detailed study into the strength of such localized states . we show that it can be related to the amount of entanglement created by the walks , with minima appearing for strong localizations . this feature also persists in the presence of small amounts of $ \sigma_x$ ( bit flip ) noise .
