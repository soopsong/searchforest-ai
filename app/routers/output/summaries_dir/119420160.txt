entangled multi - qubit states are an essential resource for quantum information and computation . solid - state emitters can mediate interactions between subsequently emitted photons via their spin , thus offering a route towards generating entangled multi - photon states . however , existing schemes typically rely on the incoherent emission of single photons and suffer from severe practical limitations , for self - assembled quantum dots most notably the limited spin coherence time due to overhauser magnetic field fluctuations . we here propose an alternative approach of employing spin - flip raman scattering events of self - assembled quantum dots in voigt geometry . we argue that weakly driven hole spins constitute a promising platform for the practical generation of frequency - entangled photonic cluster states .
