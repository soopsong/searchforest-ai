quantum technologies lead to a variety of applications that outperform their classical counterparts . in order to build a quantum device it must be verified that it operates below some error threshold . recently , because of technological developments which allow for the experimental realization of quantum states with increasing complexity , these tasks must be applied to large multi - qubit states . however , due to the exponentially - increasing system size , tasks like quantum entanglement verification become hard to carry out in such cases . here we develop a generic framework to translate any entanglement witness into a resource - efficient probabilistic scheme . we show that the confidence to detect entanglement grows exponentially with the number of individual detection events . to benchmark our findings , we experimentally verify the presence of entanglement in a photonic six - qubit cluster state generated using three single - photon sources operating at telecommunication wavelengths . we find that its presence can be certified with at least 99.74 % confidence by detecting 20 copies of the quantum state . additionally , we show that genuine six - qubit entanglement is verified with at least 99 % confidence by using 112 copies of the state . our protocol can be carried out with a remarkably low number of copies , making it a practical and applicable method to verify large - scale quantum devices .
