we address the limit of the gaussian operations and classical communication in the problem of quantum state discrimination . we show that the optimal gaussian strategy for the discrimination of the binary phase shift keyed ( bpsk ) coherent signal is a simple homodyne detection . we also propose practical near - optimal quantum receivers that beat the bpsk homodyne limit in all areas of the signal power . our scheme is simple and does not require realtime electrical feedback .
