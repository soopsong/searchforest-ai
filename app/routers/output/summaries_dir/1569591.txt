one of the most striking features of quantum theory is the existence of entangled states , responsible for einstein 's so called"spooky action at a distance " . these states emerge from the mathematical formalism of quantum theory , but to date we do not have a clear idea of the physical principles that give rise to entanglement . why does nature have entangled states ? would any theory superseding classical theory have entangled states , or is quantum theory special ? one important feature of quantum theory is that it has a classical limit , recovering classical theory through the process of decoherence . we show that any theory with a classical limit must contain entangled states , thus establishing entanglement as an inevitable feature of any theory superseding classical theory .
