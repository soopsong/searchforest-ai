the entanglement content of high - dimensional random pure states is almost maximal , nevertheless , we show that , due to the complexity of such states , the detection of their entanglement using witness operators is rather difficult . we discuss the case of unknown random states , and the case of known random states for which we can optimize the entanglement witness . moreover , we show that coarse graining , modeled by considering mixtures of m random states instead of pure ones , leads to a decay in the entanglement detection probability exponential with m. our results also allow to explain the emergence of classicality in coarse grained quantum chaotic dynamics .
