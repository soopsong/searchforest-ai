we report a development of an electro - optomechanical system based on a surface acoustic wave ( saw ) , where a piezoelectric material with a large optoelastic susceptibility is used for the coupling of both a radio wave and optical light to the saw . in the optical domain , we exploit a tensorial nature of the optoelastic effect to show a polarization dependence of the photon - saw interaction . we discuss the construction of two - dimensional saw focusing circuits for the coupling enhancement and the optical cavity enhanced photon - phonon scattering . we estimate an optomechanical coupling rate $ g_0 $ of the system and discuss the future direction for the improvement of the coupling strength .
