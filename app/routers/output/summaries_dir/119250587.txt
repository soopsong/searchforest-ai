we propose an efficient optomechanical mass sensor operating at exceptional points ( eps ) , non - hermitian degeneracies where eigenvalues of a system and their corresponding eigenvectors simultaneously coalesce . the benchmark system consists of two optomechanical cavities ( omcs ) that are mechanically coupled , where we engineer mechanical gain ( loss ) by driving the cavity with a blue ( red ) detuned laser . the system features ep at the gain and loss balance , where any perturbation induces a frequency splitting that scales as the square - root of the perturbation strength , resulting in a giant sensitivity factor enhancement compared to the conventional optomechanical sensors . for non - degenerated mechanical resonators , quadratic optomechanical coupling is used to tune the mismatch frequency in order to get closer to the ep , extending the efficiency of our sensing scheme to mismatched resonators . this work paves the way towards new levels of sensitivity for optomechanical sensors , which could find applications in many other fields including nanoparticles detection , precision measurement , and quantum metrology .
