the conditions under which entanglement becomes maximal are sought in the general one -- dimensional quantum random walk with two walkers . moreover , a one -- dimensional shift operator for the two walkers is introduced and its performance in generating entanglement is analyzed as a function of several free parameters , some of them coming from the shift operator itself and some others from the coin operator . to simplify the investigation an averaged entanglement is defined .
