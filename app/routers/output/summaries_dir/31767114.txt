we study zero - temperature quantum spin chains which are characterized by a non - vanishing current . for the xx model starting from the initial state | ... + + + - - - ... > we derive an exact expression for the variance of the total spin current . we show that asymptotically the variance exhibits an anomalously slow logarithmic growth ; we also extract the sub - leading constant term . we then argue that the logarithmic growth remains valid for the xxz model in the critical region .
