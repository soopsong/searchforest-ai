similarly to quantum states , also quantum measurements can be"mixed " , corresponding to a random choice within an ensemble of measuring apparatuses . such mixing is equivalent to a sort of hidden variable , which produces a noise of purely classical nature . it is then natural to ask which apparatuses are"indecomposable " , i. e. do not correspond to any random choice of apparatuses . this problem is interesting not only for foundations , but also for applications , since most optimization strategies give optimal apparatuses that are indecomposable . mathematically the problem is posed describing each measuring apparatus by a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) , which gives the statistics of the outcomes for any input state . the povm 's form a convex set , and in this language the indecomposable apparatuses are represented by extremal points -- the analogous of"pure states"in the convex set of states . differently from the case of states , however , indecomposable povm 's are not necessarily rank - one , e. g. von neumann measurements . in this paper we give a complete classification of indecomposable apparatuses ( for discrete spectrum ) , by providing different necessary and sufficient conditions for extremality of povm 's , along with a simple general algorithm for the decomposition of a povm into extremals . as an interesting application,"informationally complete"measurements are analyzed in this respect . the convex set of povm 's is fully characterized by determining its border in terms of simple algebraic properties of the corresponding povm 's .
