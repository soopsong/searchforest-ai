the out - of - time - ordered correlators ( otocs ) have been proposed and widely used recently as a tool to define and describe many - body quantum chaos . here , we develop the keldysh non - linear sigma model technique to calculate these correlators in interacting disordered metals . in particular , we focus on the regularized and unregularized otocs , defined as $ tr[\sqrt{\rho } a(t ) \sqrt{\rho } a^\dagger(t)]$ and $ tr[\rho a(t)a^\dagger(t)]$ respectively ( where $ a(t)$ is the anti - commutator of fermion field operators and $ \rho$ is the thermal density matrix ) . the calculation of the rate of otocs ' exponential growth is reminiscent to that of the dephasing rate in interacting metals , but here it involves two replicas of the system ( two"worlds " ) . the intra - world contributions reproduce the dephasing ( that would correspond to a decay of the correlator ) , while the inter - world terms provide a term of the opposite sign that exceeds dephasing . consequently , both regularized and unregularized otocs grow exponentially in time , but surprisingly we find that the corresponding many - body lyapunov exponents are different . for the regularized correlator , we reproduce an earlier perturbation theory result for the lyapunov exponent that satisfies the maldacena - shenker - stanford bound . however , the lyapunov exponent of the unregularized correlator parametrically exceeds the bound . we argue that the latter is not a reliable indicator of many body quantum chaos as it contains additional contributions from elastic scattering events due to virtual processes that should not contribute to many - body chaos . these results bring up an important general question of the physical meaning of the otocs often used in calculations and proofs . we briefly discuss possible connections of the otocs to observables in quantum interference effects and level statistics via a many - body analogue of the bohigas - giannoni - schmit conjecture .
