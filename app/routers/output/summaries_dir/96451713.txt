the notions of qubits and coherent states correspond to different physical systems and are described by specific formalisms . qubits are associated with a two - dimensional hilbert space and can be illustrated on the bloch sphere . in contrast , the underlying hilbert space of coherent states is infinite - dimensional and the states are typically represented in phase space . for the particular case of binary coherent state alphabets these otherwise distinct formalisms can equally be applied . we capitalize this formal connection to analyse the properties of optimally cloned binary coherent states . several practical and near - optimal cloning schemes are discussed and the associated fidelities are compared to the performance of the optimal cloner .
