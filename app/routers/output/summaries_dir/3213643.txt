an analysis is conducted of the multipartite entanglement for gaussian states generated by the parametric down - conversion of a femtosecond frequency comb . using a recently introduced method for constructing optimal entanglement criteria , a family of tests is formulated for mode decompositions that extends beyond the traditional bipartition analyses . a numerical optimization over this family is performed to achieve maximal significance of entanglement verification . for experimentally prepared 4- , 6- , and 10-mode states , full entanglement is certified for all of the 14 , 202 , and 115974 possible nontrivial partitions , respectively .
