we present two different strategies for developing a quantum information science platform , based on our experimental results with magnetic microtrap arrays on a magnetic - film atom chip . the first strategy aims for mesoscopic ensemble qubits in a lattice of ~5 { \mu}m period , so that qubits can be individually addressed and interactions can be mediated by rydberg excitations . the second strategy aims for direct quantum simulators using sub - optical lattices of ~100 nm period . these would allow the realization of condensed matter inspired quantum many - body systems , such as hubbard models in new parameter regimes . the two approaches raise quite different issues , some of which are identified and discussed .
