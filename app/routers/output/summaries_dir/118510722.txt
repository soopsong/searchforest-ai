quantum key distribution is a quantum communication technique in which random numbers are encoded on quantum systems , usually photons , and sent from one party , alice , to another , bob . using the data sent via the quantum signals , supplemented by classical communication , it is possible for alice and bob to share an unconditionally secure secret key . this is not possible if only classical signals are sent . whilst this last statement is a long standing result from quantum information theory it turns out only to be true in a non - relativistic setting . if relativistic quantum field theory is considered we show it is possible to distribute an unconditionally secure secret key without sending a quantum signal , instead harnessing the intrinsic entanglement between different regions of space time . the protocol is practical in free space given horizon technology and might be testable in principle in the near term using microwave technology .
