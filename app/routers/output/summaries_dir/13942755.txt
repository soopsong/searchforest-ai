this paper presents models for transforming standard reversible circuits into linear nearest neighbor ( lnn ) architecture without inserting swap gates . templates to optimize the transformed lnn circuits are proposed . all minimal lnn circuits for all 3-qubit functions have been generated to serve as benchmarks to evaluate heuristic optimization algorithms . the minimal results generated are compared with optimized lnn circuits obtained from the post synthesis algorithm --- template matching with lnn templates . experiments show that the suggested synthesis flow significantly improves the quantum cost of circuits .
