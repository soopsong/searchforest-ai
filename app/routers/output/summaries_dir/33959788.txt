the theory of quantum brownian motion describes the properties of a large class of open quantum systems . nonetheless , its description in terms of a born - markov master equation , widely used in the literature , is known to violate the positivity of the density operator at very low temperatures . we study an extension of existing models , leading to an equation in the lindblad form , which is free of this problem . we study the dynamics of the model , including the detailed properties of its stationary solution , for both constant and position - dependent coupling of the brownian particle to the bath , focusing in particular on the correlations and the squeezing of the probability distribution induced by the environment
