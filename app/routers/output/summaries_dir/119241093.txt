among the most popular and well studied quantum characterization , verification and validation techniques is randomized benchmarking ( rb ) , an important statistical tool used to characterize the performance of physical logic operations useful in quantum information processing . in this work we provide a detailed mathematical treatment of the effect of temporal noise correlations on the outcomes of rb protocols . we provide a fully analytic framework capturing the accumulation of error in rb expressed in terms of a three - dimensional random walk in"pauli space . "using this framework we derive the probability density function describing rb outcomes ( averaged over noise ) for both markovian and correlated errors , which we show is generally described by a gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters depending on the correlation structure . long temporal correlations impart large nonvanishing variance and skew in the distribution towards high - fidelity outcomes -- consistent with existing experimental data -- highlighting potential finite - sampling pitfalls and the divergence of the mean rb outcome from worst - case errors in the presence of noise correlations . we use the filter - transfer function formalism to reveal the underlying reason for these differences in terms of effective coherent averaging of correlated errors in certain random sequences . we conclude by commenting on the impact of these calculations on the utility of single - metric approaches to quantum characterization , verification , and validation .
