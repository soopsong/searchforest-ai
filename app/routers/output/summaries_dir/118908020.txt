we propose a quantum simulation of the quantum rabi model in an atomic quantum dot , which is a single atom in a tight optical trap coupled to the quasiparticle modes of a superfluid bose - einstein condensate . this widely tunable setup allows to simulate the ultrastrong coupling regime of light - matter interaction in a system which enjoys an amenable characteristic timescale , paving the way for an experimental analysis of the transition between the jaynes - cummings and the quantum rabi dynamics using cold - atom systems . our scheme can be naturally extended to simulate multi - qubit quantum rabi models . in particular , we discuss the appearance of effective two - qubit interactions due to phononic exchange , among other features .
