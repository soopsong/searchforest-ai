in a quantum markov chain , the temporal succession of states is modeled by the repeated action of a"bistochastic quantum operation"on the density matrix of a quantum system . based on this conceptual framework , we derive some new results concerning the evolution of a quantum system , including its long - term behavior . among our findings is the fact that the ces$\grave{a}$ro limit of any quantum markov chain always exists and equals the orthogonal projection of the initial state upon the eigenspace of the unit eigenvalue of the bistochastic quantum operation . moreover , if the unit eigenvalue is the only eigenvalue on the unit circle , then the quantum markov chain converges in the conventional sense to the said orthogonal projection . as a corollary , we offer a new derivation of the classic result describing limiting distributions of unitary quantum walks on finite graphs \cite{aakv01 } .
