we investigate thin films of conducting aluminium - oxide , also known as granular aluminium , as a material for superconducting high quality , high kinetic inductance circuits . the films are deposited by an optimised reactive dc magnetron sputter process and characterised using microwave measurement techniques at milli - kelvin temperatures . we show that , by precise control of the reactive sputter conditions , a high room temperature sheet resistance and therefore high kinetic inductance at low temperatures can be obtained . for a coplanar waveguide resonator with 1.5\,k$\omega$ sheet resistance and a kinetic inductance fraction close to unity , we measure a quality factor in the order of 700\,000 at 20\,mk . furthermore , we observe a sheet resistance reduction by gentle heat treatment in air . this behaviour is exploited to study the kinetic inductance change using the microwave response of a coplanar wave guide resonator . we find the correlation between the kinetic inductance and the sheet resistance to be in good agreement with theoretical expectations .
