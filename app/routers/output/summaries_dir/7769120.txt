we consider the definition of quantum walks on directed graphs . call a directed graph reversible if , for each pair of vertices ( i , j ) , if i is connected to j then there is a path from j to i. we show that reversibility is a necessary and sufficient condition for a directed graph to allow the notion of a discrete - time quantum walk , and discuss some implications of this condition . we present a method for defining a"partially quantum"walk on directed graphs that are not reversible .
