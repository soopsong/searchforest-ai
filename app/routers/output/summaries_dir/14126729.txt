an asymmetric nature of the boson ` destruction ' operator $ \hat{a}$ and its ` creation ' partner $ \hat{a}^{\dagger}$ is made apparent by applying them to a quantum state $ |\psi>$ different from the fock state $ |n>$. we show that it is possible to { \em increase } ( by many times or by any quantity ) the mean number of quanta in the new ` photon - subtracted ' state $ \hat{a}|\psi>$. moreover , for certain ` hyper - poissonian ' states $ |\psi>$ the mean number of quanta in the ( normalized ) state $ \hat{a}|\psi>$ can be much greater than in the ` photon - added ' state $ \hat{a}^{\dagger}|\psi>$. the explanation of this ` paradox ' is given and some examples elucidating the meaning of mandel 's $ q$-parameter and the exponential phase operators are considered .
