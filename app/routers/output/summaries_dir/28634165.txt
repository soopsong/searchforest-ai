mapping the system evolution of a two - state system allows the determination of the effective system hamiltonian directly . we show how this can be achieved even if the system is decohering appreciably over the observation time . a method to include various decoherence models is given and the limits of this technique are explored . this technique is applicable both to the problem of calibrating a control hamiltonian for quantum computing applications and for precision experiments in two - state quantum systems . for simple models of decoherence , this method can be applied even when the decoherence time is comparable to the oscillation period of the system .
