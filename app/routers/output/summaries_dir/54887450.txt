we define and analyze measures of correlations for bipartite states based on trace distance . for bell diagonal states of two qubits , in addition to the known expression for quantum correlations using this metric , we provide analytic expressions for the classical and total correlations . the ensuing hierarchy of correlations based on trace distance is compared to the ones based on relative entropy and hilbert - schmidt norm . although some common features can be found , the trace distance measure is shown to differentiate from the others in that the closest uncorrelated state to a given bipartite quantum state is not given by the product of the marginals , and further , the total correlations are strictly smaller than the sum of the quantum and classical correlations . we compare the various correlation measures in two dynamical non - markovian models , locally applied phase - flip channels and random external fields . it is shown that the freezing behavior , observed across all known valid measures of quantum correlations for bell diagonal states under local phase - flip channels , occurs for a larger set of starting states for the trace distance than for the other metrics .
