it is the aim of this article to determine curvature quantities of an arbitrary riemannian monotone metric on the space of positive matrices resp . nonsingular density matrices . special interest is focused on the scalar curvature due to its expected quantum statistical meaning . the scalar curvature is explained in more detail for three examples , the bures metric , the largest monotone metric and the kubo - mori metric . in particular , we show an important conjecture of petz concerning the kubo - mori metric up to a formal proof of the concavity of a certain function on r_+^3 . this concavity seems to be numerically evident . the conjecture of petz asserts that the scalar curvature of the kubo - mori metric increases if one goes to more mixed states .
