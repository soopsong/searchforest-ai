we discuss a model with ultra - cold atoms confined in optical superlattices . in particular , we study the ground - state properties of two spin-1 bosons trapped in a double - well potential . depending on the external magnetic field and biquadratic interactions different phases of magnetic order are realized . applying von neumann entropy and number of relevant orbitals , we quantify the bipartite entanglement between particles . changing the values of the parameters determining superlattices , we can switch the system between differently entangled states .
