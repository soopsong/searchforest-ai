we investigate the usefulness of a recently introduced five qubit state by brown $ \it et al . \normalfont$ \cite{brown } for quantum teleportation , quantum state sharing and superdense coding . it is shown that this five - qubit state can be utilized for perfect teleportation of arbitrary single and two qubit systems . we devise various schemes for quantum state sharing of an arbitrary single and two particle state via cooperative teleportation . we later show that this state can be used for superdense coding as well . it is found that five classical bits can be sent by sending only three quantum bits .
