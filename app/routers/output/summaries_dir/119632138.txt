we consider from a microscopic perspective large deviation properties of several stochastic interacting particle systems , using their mapping to integrable quantum spin systems . a brief review of recent work is given and several new results are presented : ( i ) for the general disordered symmectric exclusion process ( sep ) on some finite lattice conditioned on no jumps into some absorbing sublattice and with initial bernoulli product measure with density $ \rho$ we prove that the probability $ s_\rho(t)$ of no absorption event up to microscopic time $ t$ can be expressed in terms of the generating function for the particle number of a sep with particle injection and empty initial lattice . specifically , for the symmetric simple exclusion process on $ \mathbb z$ conditioned on no jumps into the origin we obtain the explicit first and second order expansion in $ \rho$ of $ s_\rho(t)$ and also to first order in $ \rho$ the optimal microscopic density profile under this conditioning . for the disordered asep on the finite torus conditioned on a very large current we show that the effective dynamics that optimally realizes this rare event does not depend on the disorder , except for the time scale . for annihilating and coalescing random walkers we obtain the generating function of the number of annihilated particles up to time $ t$ , which turns out to exhibit some universal features .
