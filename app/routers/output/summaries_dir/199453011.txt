the conventional photon subtraction and photon addition transformations , $ \varrho \rightarrow t a \varrho a^{\dag}$ and $ \varrho \rightarrow t a^{\dag } \varrho a$ , are not valid quantum operations for any constant $ t>0 $ since these transformations are not trace nonincreasing . for a fixed density operator $ \varrho$ there exist fair quantum operations , $ { \cal n}_{-}$ and $ { \cal n}_{+}$ , whose conditional output states approximate the normalized outputs of former transformations with an arbitrary accuracy . however , the uniform convergence for some classes of density operators $ \varrho$ has remained essentially unknown . here we show that , in the case of photon addition operation , the uniform convergence takes place for the energy - second - moment - constrained states such that $ { \rm tr}[\varrho h^2 ] \leq e_2<\infty$ , $ h = a^{\dag}a$. in the case of photon subtraction , the uniform convergence takes place for the energy - second - moment - constrained states with nonvanishing energy , i.e. , the states $ \varrho$ such that $ { \rm tr}[\varrho h ] \geq e_1>0 $ and $ { \rm tr}[\varrho h^2 ] \leq e_2<\infty$. we prove that these conditions can not be relaxed and generalize the results to the cases of multiple photon subtraction and addition .
