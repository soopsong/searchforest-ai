we suggest alternative quantum otto engines , using heat bath algorithmic cooling with partner pairing algorithm instead of isochoric cooling . liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance systems in one entropy sink are considered as working fluids . then , the extractable work and thermal efficiency are analyzed in detail for four - stroke and two - stroke type of quantum otto engines . the role of heat bath algorithmic cooling in these cycles is to use a single entropy sink instead of two . also , this cooling algorithm increases the power of engines reducing the time required for one cycle .
