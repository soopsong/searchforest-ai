high - dimensional degrees of freedom of photons can encode more quantum information than their two - dimensional counterparts . while the increased information capacity has advantages in quantum applications ( such as quantum communication ) , controlling and manipulating these systems has been challenging . here we show a method to perform lossless arbitrary high - dimensional pauli - x gates for single photon . the x - gate consists of a cyclic permutation of qudit basis vectors , and , together with the z gate , forms the basis for performing arbitrary transformations . we propose an implementation of such gates on the orbital angular momentum of photons . the proposed experimental setups only use two basic optical elements such as mode - sorters and mode - shifters -- thus could be implemented in any system where these experimental tools are available . furthermore the number of involved interferometers scales logarithmically with the dimension , which is important for practical implementation .
