we define a new criterion for selecting a specific minimal entanglement purification of given mixed states in generic quantum states using the entanglement of purification . we then propose that its holographic dual is the state living on the boundary of the entanglement wedge in the surface - state correspondence . finally , we make some remarks about the relationship between this and the complexity equals action proposals .
