high dimensional quantum states are of fundamental interest for quantum information processing . they give access to large hilbert spaces and , in turn , enable the encoding of quantum information on multiple modes . one method to create such quantum states is parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) in waveguide arrays ( wgas ) which allows for the creation of highly entangled photon - pairs in controlled , easily accessible spatial modes , with unique spectral properties . in this paper we examine both theoretically and experimentally the pdc process in a lithium niobate wga . we measure the spatial and spectral properties of the emitted photon - pairs , revealing strong correlations between spectral and spatial degrees of freedom of the created photons . our measurements show that , in contrast to prior theoretical approaches , spectrally dependent coupling effects have to be taken into account in the theory of pdc in wgas . to interpret the results , we developed a theoretical model specifically taking into account spectrally dependent coupling effects , which further enables us to explore the capabilities and limitations for engineering the spatial correlations of the generated quantum states .
