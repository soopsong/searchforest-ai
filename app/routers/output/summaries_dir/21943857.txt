in distributed systems based on the quantum recursive network architecture , quantum channels and quantum memories are used to establish entangled quantum states between node pairs . such systems are robust against attackers that interact with the quantum channels . conversely , weaknesses emerge when an attacker takes full control of a node and alters the configuration of the local quantum memory , either to make a denial - of - service attack or to reprogram the node . in such a scenario , entanglement verification over quantum memories is a means for detecting the intruder . usually , entanglement verification approaches focus either on untrusted sources of entangled qubits ( photons , in most cases ) or on eavesdroppers that interfere with the quantum channel while entangled qubits are transmitted . instead , in this work we assume that the source of entanglement is trusted , but parties may be dishonest . looking for efficient entanglement verification protocols that only require classical channels and local quantum operations to work , we thoroughly analyze the one proposed by nagy and akl , that we denote as na2010 for simplicity , and we define and analyze two entanglement verification protocols based on teleportation ( denoted as ac1 and ac2 ) , characterized by increasing efficiency in terms of intrusion detection probability versus sacrificed quantum resources .
