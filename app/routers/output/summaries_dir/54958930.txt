we show that measurement - based quantum computation on scalable continuous - variable ( cv ) cluster states admits more quantum - circuit flexibility and compactness than similar protocols for standard square - lattice cv cluster states . this advantage is a direct result of the macronode structure of these states --- that is , a lattice structure in which each graph node actually consists of several physical modes . these extra modes provide additional measurement degrees of freedom at each graph location , which can be used to manipulate the flow and processing of quantum information more robustly and with additional flexibility that is not available on an ordinary lattice .
