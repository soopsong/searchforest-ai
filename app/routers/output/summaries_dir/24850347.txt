the hierarchical graphs and sierpi\'nski graphs are constructed iteratively , which have the same number of vertices and edges at any iteration , but exhibit quite different structural properties : the hierarchical graphs are non - fractal and small - world , while the sierpi\'nski graphs are fractal and"large - world " . both graphs have found broad applications . in this paper , we study consensus problems in hierarchical graphs and sierpi\'nski graphs , focusing on three important quantities of consensus problems , that is , convergence speed , delay robustness , and coherence for first - order ( and second - order ) dynamics , which are , respectively , determined by algebraic connectivity , maximum eigenvalue , and sum of reciprocal ( and square of reciprocal ) of each nonzero eigenvalue of laplacian matrix . for both graphs , based on the explicit recursive relation of eigenvalues at two successive iterations , we evaluate the second smallest eigenvalue , as well as the largest eigenvalue , and obtain the closed - form solutions to the sum of reciprocals ( and square of reciprocals ) of all nonzero eigenvalues . we also compare our obtained results for consensus problems on both graphs and show that they differ in all quantities concerned , which is due to the marked difference of their topological structures .
