we prove that one - way quantum computations have the same computational power as quantum circuits with unbounded fan - out . it demonstrates that the one - way model is not only one of the most promising models of physical realisation , but also a very powerful model of quantum computation . it confirms and completes previous results which have pointed out , for some specific problems , a depth separation between the one - way model and the quantum circuit model . since one - way model has the same computational power as unbounded quantum fan - out circuits , the quantum fourier transform can be approximated in constant depth in the one - way model , and thus the factorisation can be done by a polytime probabilistic classical algorithm which has access to a constant - depth one - way quantum computer . the extra power of the one - way model , comparing with the quantum circuit model , comes from its classical - quantum hybrid nature . we show that this extra power is reduced to the capability to perform unbounded classical parity gates in constant depth .
