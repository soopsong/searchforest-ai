we investigate the optimal control problem for non - markovian open , dissipative quantum system . optimal control using pontryagin maximum principle is specifically derived . the influences of ohmic reservoir with lorentz - drude regularization are numerically studied in a two - level system under the following three conditions : \omega_0\ll\omega_c , \omega_0\approx\omega_c or \omega_0\gg\omega_c , where \omega_0 is the characteristic frequency of the quantum system of interest , and \omega_c the cut - off frequency of ohmic reservoir . the optimal control process shows its remarkable influences on the decoherence dynamics . the temperature is a key factor in the decoherence dynamics . we analyze the optimal decoherence control in high temperature , intermediate temperature , and low temperature reservoirs respectively . it implies that designing some engineered reservoirs with the controlled coupling and state of the environment can slow down the decoherence rate and delay the decoherence time . moreover , we compare the non - markovian optimal decoherence control with the markovian one and find that with non - markovian the engineered artificial reservoirs are better than with the markovian approximation in controlling the open , dissipative quantum system 's decoherence .
