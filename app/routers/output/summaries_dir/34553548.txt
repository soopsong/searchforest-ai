for two two - level atoms coupled to a single - mode cavity field that is driven and heavily damped , the steady - state can be entangled by shining an un - modulated driving laser on the system [ s.schneider , g. j. milburn phys . rev a 65 , 042107 , 2002 ] . we present a scheme to significantly increase the steady - state entanglement by using homodyne - mediated feedback , in which the driving laser is modulated by the homodyne photocurrent derived from the cavity output . such feedback can increase the nonlinear response to both the decoherence process of the two - qubit system and the coherent evolution of individual qubits . we present the properties of the entangled states using the so(3 ) q function .
