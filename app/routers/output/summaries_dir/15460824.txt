quantum key distribution ( qkd ) is a quantum - proof key - exchange scheme which is fast approaching the communication industry . an essential component in qkd is the information reconciliation step , which is used for correcting the quantum - channel noise errors . the recently suggested blind reconciliation technique , based on low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes , offers remarkable prospectives for efficient information reconciliation without an a priori error rate estimation . we suggest an improvement of the blind - information - reconciliation protocol promoting a significant increase in the efficiency of the procedure and reducing its interactivity . the proposed technique is based on introducing symmetry in operations of parties , and the consideration of results of unsuccessful belief - propagation decodings .
