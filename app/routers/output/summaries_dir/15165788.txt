the technical merits of weak value amplification techniques are analyzed . we consider models of several different types of technical noise in an optical context and show that weak value amplification techniques ( which only use a small fraction of the photons ) compare favorably with standard techniques ( which uses all of them ) . using the fisher information metric , we demonstrate that weak value techniques can put all of the fisher information about the detected parameter into a small portion of the events and show how this fact alone gives technical advantages . we go on to consider a time correlated noise model , and find that a fisher information analysis indicates that while the standard method can have much larger information about the detected parameter than the postselected technique . however , the estimator needed to gather the information is technically difficult to implement , showing that the inefficient ( but practical ) signal - to - noise estimation of the parameter is usually superior . we also describe other technical advantages unique to imaginary weak value amplification techniques , focusing on beam deflection measurements . in this case , we discuss combined noise types ( such as detector transverse jitter , angular beam jitter before the interferometer and turbulence ) for which the interferometric weak value technique gives higher fisher information over conventional methods . we go on to calculate the fisher information of the recently proposed photon recycling scheme for beam deflection measurements , and show it further boosts the fisher information by the inverse postselection probability relative to the standard measurement case .
