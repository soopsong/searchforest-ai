we propose an alternative scheme of shortcuts to quantum phase gate in a much shorter time based on the approach of lewis - riesenfeld invariants in cavity quantum electronic dynamics ( qed ) systems . this scheme can be used to perform one - qubit phase gate , two - qubit controlled phase gate and also multiqubit controlled phase gate . the strict numerical simulation for some quantum gates are given , and demonstrate that the total operation time of our scheme is shorter than previous schemes and very robustness against decoherence .
