we consider a nanomechanical analogue of a nonlinear interferometer , consisting of two parallel , flexural nanomechanical resonators , each with an intrinsic duffing nonlinearity and with a switchable beamsplitter - like coupling between them . we calculate the precision with which the strength of the nonlinearity can be estimated and show that it scales as $ 1 / n^{3/2}$ , where $ n$ is the mean phonon number of the initial state . this result holds even in the presence of dissipation , but assumes the ability to make measurements of the quadrature components of the nanoresonators .
