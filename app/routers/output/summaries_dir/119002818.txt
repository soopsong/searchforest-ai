sufficient conditions for complete controllability of $ n$-level quantum systems subject to a single control pulse that addresses multiple allowed transitions concurrently are established . the results are applied in particular to morse and harmonic - oscillator systems , as well as some systems with degenerate energy levels . morse and harmonic oscillators serve as models for molecular bonds , and the standard control approach of using a sequence of frequency - selective pulses to address a single transition at a time is either not applicable or only of limited utility for such systems .
