we develop a framework for studying the well - known universal term in the renyi entropy for an arbitrary entangling region in four - dimensional conformal field theories that are holographically dual to gravitational theories . the shape dependence of the renyi entropy $ s_n$ is described by two coefficients : $ f_b(n)$ for traceless extrinsic curvature deformations and $ f_c(n)$ for weyl tensor deformations . we provide the first calculation of the coefficient $ f_b(n)$ in interacting theories by relating it to the stress tensor one - point function in a deformed hyperboloid background . the latter is then determined by a straightforward holographic calculation . our results show that a previous conjecture $ f_b(n ) = f_c(n)$ , motivated by surprising evidence from a variety of free field theories and studies of conical defects , fails holographically .
