spectral properties of an arbitrary matrix can be characterized by the entropy of its rescaled singular values . any quantum operation can be described by the associated dynamical matrix or by the corresponding superoperator . the entropy of the dynamical matrix describes the degree of decoherence introduced by the map , while the entropy of the superoperator characterizes the a priori knowledge of the receiver of the outcome of a quantum channel phi . we prove that for any map acting on a n -- dimensional quantum system the sum of both entropies is not smaller than ln n. for any bistochastic map this lower bound reads 2 ln n. we investigate also the corresponding r\'enyi entropies , providing an upper bound for their sum and analyze entanglement of the bi - partite quantum state associated with the channel .
