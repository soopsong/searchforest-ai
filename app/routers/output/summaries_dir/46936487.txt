a class of langevin stochastic differential equations is shown to converge in the small - mass limit under very weak assumptions on the coefficients defining the equation . the convergence result is applied to physically realizable examples where the coefficients defining the langevin equation grow unboundedly either at a boundary , such as a wall , and/or at the point at infinity .
