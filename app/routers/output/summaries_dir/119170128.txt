it is well known that a particle can not freely share entanglement with two or more particles . this restriction is generally called monogamy . however the formal quantification of such restriction is only known for some measures of entanglement and for two - level systems . the first and broadly known monogamy relation was established by coffman , kundu , and wootters for the square of the concurrence . since then , it is usually said that the entanglement of formation is not monogamous , as it does not obey the same relation . we show here that despite that , the entanglement of formation can not be freely shared and therefore should be said to be monogamous . furthermore , the square of the entanglement of formation does obey the same relation of the squared concurrence , a fact recently noted for three particles and extended here for n particles . therefore the entanglement of formation is as monogamous as the concurrence . we also numerically study how the entanglement is distributed in pure states of three qubits and the relation between the sum of the bipartite entanglement and the classical correlation .
