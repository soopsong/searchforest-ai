magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) has been proposed as a complimentary method to measure bone quality and assess fracture risk . however , manual segmentation of mr images of bone is time - consuming , limiting the use of mri measurements in the clinical practice . the purpose of this paper is to present an automatic proximal femur segmentation method that is based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) . this study had institutional review board approval and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects . a dataset of volumetric structural mr images of the proximal femur from 86 subject were manually - segmented by an expert . we performed experiments by training two different cnn architectures with multiple number of initial feature maps and layers , and tested their segmentation performance against the gold standard of manual segmentations using four - fold cross - validation . automatic segmentation of the proximal femur achieved a high dice similarity score of 0.94$\pm$0.05 with precision = 0.95$\pm$0.02 , and recall = 0.94$\pm$0.08 using a cnn architecture based on 3d convolution exceeding the performance of 2d cnns . the high segmentation accuracy provided by cnns has the potential to help bring the use of structural mri measurements of bone quality into clinical practice for management of osteoporosis .
