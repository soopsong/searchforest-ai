when computing a confidence interval for a binomial proportion p one must choose between using an exact interval , which has a coverage probability of at least 1-{\alpha } for all values of p , and a shorter approximate interval , which may have lower coverage for some p but that on average has coverage equal to 1-\alpha . we investigate the cost of using the exact one and two - sided clopper -- pearson confidence intervals rather than shorter approximate intervals , first in terms of increased expected length and then in terms of the increase in sample size required to obtain a desired expected length . using asymptotic expansions , we also give a closed - form formula for determining the sample size for the exact clopper -- pearson methods . for two - sided intervals , our investigation reveals an interesting connection between the frequentist clopper -- pearson interval and bayesian intervals based on noninformative priors .
