we study quantum information processing using superpositions of fock states in superconducting resonators , as quantum $ d$-level systems ( qudits ) . a universal set of single and coupled logic gates is theoretically proposed for resonators coupled by superconducting circuits of josephson juctions . these gates use experimentally demonstrated interactions , and provide an attractive route to quantum information processing using harmonic oscillator modes .
