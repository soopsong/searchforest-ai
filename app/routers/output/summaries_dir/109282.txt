the creation of composite quantum gates that implement quantum response functions $ \hat{u}(\theta)$ dependent on some parameter of interest $ \theta$ is often more of an art than a science . through inspired design , a sequence of $ l$ primitive gates also depending on $ \theta$ can engineer a highly nontrivial $ \hat{u}(\theta)$ that enables myriad precision metrology , spectroscopy , and control techniques . however , discovering new , useful examples of $ \hat{u}(\theta)$ requires great intuition to perceive the possibilities , and often brute - force to find optimal implementations . we present a systematic and efficient methodology for composite gate design of arbitrary length , where phase - controlled primitive gates all rotating by $ \theta$ act on a single spin . we fully characterize the realizable family of $ \hat{u}(\theta)$ , provide an efficient algorithm that decomposes a choice of $ \hat{u}(\theta)$ into its shortest sequence of gates , and show how to efficiently choose an achievable $ \hat{u}(\theta)$ that for fixed $ l$ , is an optimal approximation to objective functions on its quadratures . a strong connection is forged with \emph{classical } discrete - time signal processing , allowing us to swiftly construct , as examples , compensated gates with optimal bandwidth that implement arbitrary single spin rotations with sub - wavelength spatial selectivity .
