brillouin laser oscillators offer powerful and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode - locked lasers , microwave oscillators , and optical gyroscopes in a variety of optical systems . however , brillouin interactions are exceedingly weak in conventional silicon photonic waveguides , stifling progress towards silicon - based brillouin lasers . the recent advent of hybrid photonic - phononic waveguides has revealed brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon . here , we harness these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate brillouin lasing in silicon . moreover , we show that this silicon - based brillouin laser enters an intriguing regime of dynamics , in which optical self - oscillation produces phonon linewidth narrowing . our results provide a platform to develop a range of applications for monolithic integration within silicon photonic circuits .
