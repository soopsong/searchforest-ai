we report that under some specific conditions a single qubit model weakly interacting with information environments can be referred to as a quantum classifier . we exploit the additivity and the divisibility properties of the completely positive ( cp ) quantum dynamical maps in order to obtain an open quantum classifier . the steady state response of the system with respect to the input parameters was numerically investigated and it 's found that the response of the open quantum dynamics at steady state acts non - linearly with respect to the input data parameters . we also demonstrate the linear separation of the quantum data instances that reflects the success of the functionality of the proposed model both for ideal and experimental conditions . superconducting circuits were pointed out as the physical model to implement the theoretical model with possible imperfections .
