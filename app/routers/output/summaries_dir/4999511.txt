we investigate periodic optomechanical arrays as reconfigurable platforms for engineering the coupling between multiple mechanical and electromagnetic modes and for exploring many - body phonon dynamics . exploiting structural resonances in the coupling between light fields and collective motional modes of the array , we show that tunable effective long - range interactions between mechanical modes can be achieved . this paves the way towards the implementation of controlled phononic walks and heat transfer on densely - connected graphs as well as the coherent transfer of excitations between distant elements of optomechanical arrays .
