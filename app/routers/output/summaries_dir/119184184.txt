we study the evolution of the entanglement of noninteracting qubits coupled to reservoirs under monitoring of the reservoirs by means of continuous measurements . we calculate the average of the concurrence of the qubits wavefunction over all quantum trajectories . for two qubits coupled to independent baths subjected to local measurements , this average decays exponentially with a rate depending on the measurement scheme only . this contrasts with the known disappearance of entanglement after a finite time for the density matrix in the absence of measurements . for two qubits coupled to a common bath , the mean concurrence can vanish at discrete times . our analysis applies to arbitrary quantum jump or quantum state diffusion dynamics in the markov limit . we discuss the best measurement schemes to protect entanglement in specific examples .
