the quantum zeno effect freezes the evolution of a quantum system subject to frequent measure- ments . we apply a fisher information analysis to show that because of this effect , a closed quantum system should be probed as rarely as possible while a dissipative quantum systems should be probed at specifically determined intervals to yield the optimal estimation of parameters governing the sys- tem dynamics . with a bayesian analysis we show that a few frequent measurements are needed to identify the parameter region within which the fisher information analysis applies
