we present relaxed criteria for quantum error correction which are useful when the specific dominant noise process is known . these criteria have no classical analogue . as an example , we provide a four - bit code which corrects for a single amplitude damping error . this code violates the usual hamming bound calculated for a pauli description of the error process , and does not fit into the gf(4 ) classification .
