in classical physics , properties of the objects exist independently on the context , i.e. whether and how measurements are performed . quantum physics showed this assumption to be wrong and that nature is indeed"contextual " . contextuality has been observed in the simplest physical systems such as single particles , and plays fundamental roles in quantum computation advantage . here , we demonstrate for the first time quantum contextuality in an integrated photonic chip . the chip implements different combinations of measurements on a single photon delocalized on four distinct spatial modes . we show violations of a chsh - like non - contextuality inequality by 14 standard deviations . this paves the way to compact and portable devices for contextuality - based quantum - powered protocols .
