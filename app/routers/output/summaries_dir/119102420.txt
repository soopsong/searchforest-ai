we implement a quantum error correction algorithm for bit - flip errors on the topological toric code using deep reinforcement learning . an action - value q - function encodes the discounted value of moving a defect to a neighboring site on the square grid ( the action ) depending on the full set of defects on the torus ( the syndrome or state ) . the q - function is represented by a deep convolutional neural network . using the translational invariance on the torus allows for viewing each defect from a central perspective which significantly simplifies the state space representation independently of the number of defect pairs . the training is done using experience replay , where data from the algorithm being played out is stored and used for mini - batch upgrade of the q - network . we find performance which is close to , and for small error rates asymptotically equivalent to , that achieved by the minimum weight perfect matching algorithm for code distances up to $ d=7$. our results show that it is possible for a self - trained agent without supervision or support algorithms to find a decoding scheme that performs on par with hand - made algorithms , opening up for future machine engineered decoders for more general error models and error correcting codes .
