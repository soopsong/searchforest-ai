a one - dimensional atom -- an atomic system coupled to a single optical mode -- is central for many applications in optical quantum technologies . here we introduce an effective one - dimensional atom consisting of two interacting quantum emitters coupled to a cavity mode . the dipole - dipole interaction and cavity coupling gives rise to optical resonances of tunable bandwidth with a constant mode coupling . such versatility , combined with a dynamical control of the system , opens the way to many applications . it can be used to generate single photon light pulses with continuous variable encoding in the time - frequency domain and light states that show sub - planck features . it can also be exploited to develop a versatile quantum memory of tunable bandwidth , another key ingredient for quantum networks . our scheme ensures that all above functionalities can be obtained at record high efficiencies . we discuss practical implementation in the most advanced platform for quantum light generation , namely the semiconductor quantum dot system where all the technological tools are in place to bring these new concepts to reality .
