conventional neuro - computing architectures and artificial neural networks have often been developed with no or loose connections to neuroscience . as a consequence , they have largely ignored key features of biological neural processing systems , such as their extremely low - power consumption features or their ability to carry out robust and efficient computation using massively parallel arrays of limited precision , highly variable , and unreliable components . recent developments in nano - technologies are making available extremely compact and low - power , but also variable and unreliable solid - state devices that can potentially extend the offerings of availing cmos technologies . in particular , memristors are regarded as a promising solution for modeling key features of biological synapses due to their nanoscale dimensions , their capacity to store multiple bits of information per element and the low energy required to write distinct states . in this paper , we first review the neuro- and neuromorphic - computing approaches that can best exploit the properties of memristor and - scale devices , and then propose a novel hybrid memristor - cmos neuromorphic circuit which represents a radical departure from conventional neuro - computing approaches , as it uses memristors to directly emulate the biophysics and temporal dynamics of real synapses . we point out the differences between the use of memristors in conventional neuro - computing architectures and the hybrid memristor - cmos circuit proposed , and argue how this circuit represents an ideal building block for implementing brain - inspired probabilistic computing paradigms that are robust to variability and fault - tolerant by design .
