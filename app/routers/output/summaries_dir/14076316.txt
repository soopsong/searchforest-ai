we investigate a quantum key distribution ( qkd ) scheme which utilizes a biased basis choice in order to increase the efficiency of the scheme . the optimal bias between the two measurement bases , a more refined error analysis , and finite key size effects are all studied in order to assure the security of the final key generated with the system . we then implement the scheme in a local entangled qkd system that uses polarization entangled photon pairs to securely distribute the key . a 50/50 non - polarizing beamsplitter with different optical attenuators is used to simulate a variable beamsplitter in order to allow us to study the operation of the system for different biases . over 6 hours of continuous operation with a total bias of 0.9837/0.0163 ( z / x ) , we were able to generate 0.4567 secure key bits per raw key bit as compared to 0.2550 secure key bits per raw key bit for the unbiased case . this represents an increase in the efficiency of the key generation rate by 79 % .
