composite quantum systems can be in generic states characterized not only by entanglement , but also by more general quantum correlations . the interplay between these two signatures of nonclassicality is still not completely understood . in this work we investigate this issue focusing on computable and observable measures of such correlations : entanglement is quantified by the negativity n , while general quantum correlations are measured by the ( normalized ) geometric quantum discord d_g . for two - qubit systems , we find that the geometric discord reduces to the squared negativity on pure states , while the relationship $ d_g \geq n^2 $ holds for arbitrary mixed states . the latter result is rigorously extended to pure , werner and isotropic states of two - qudit systems for arbitrary d , and numerical evidence of its validity for arbitrary states of a qubit and a qutrit is provided as well . our results establish an interesting hierarchy , that we conjecture to be universal , between two relevant and experimentally friendly nonclassicality indicators . this ties in with the intuition that general quantum correlations should at least contain and in general exceed entanglement on mixed states of composite quantum systems .
