we study a tripartite quantum system consisting of a coplanar - waveguide ( cpw ) resonator and a nanomechanical resonator ( namr ) connected by a flux qubit , where the flux qubit has a large detuning from both resonators . by a unitray transformation and a second - order approximation , we obtain a strong and controllable ( i.e. , magnetic - field - dependent ) effective coupling between the namr and the cpw resonator . due to the strong coupling , vacuum rabi splitting can be observed from the voltage - fluctuation spectrum of the cpw resonator . we further study the properties of single photon transport as inferred from the reflectance or equivalently the transmittance . we show that the reflectance and the corresponding phase shift spectra both exhibit doublet of narrow spectral features due to vacuum rabi splitting . by tuning the external magnetic field , the reflectance and the phase shift can be varied from 0 to 1 and $ -\pi$ to $ \pi$ , respectively . the results indicate that this hybrid quantum system can act as a quantum router .
