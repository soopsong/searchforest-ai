the fuzzball construction resolves the black hole information paradox by making spacetime end just before the horizon is reached . but if there is no traditional horizon , then do we lose the elegant relations of black hole thermodynamics ? using an argument similar to modular invariance , we argue that the answer is no ; the completeness of fuzzball states implies that the generic fuzzball indeed reproduces the thermal properties attributed to the traditional hole .
