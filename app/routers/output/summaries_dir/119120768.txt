we propose a method to perform precision measurements of the interaction parameters in systems of n ultra - cold spin 1/2 atoms . the spectroscopy is realized by first creating a coherent spin superposition of the two relevant internal states of each atom and then letting the atoms evolve under a squeezing hamiltonian . the non - linear nature of the hamiltonian decreases the fundamental limit imposed by the heisenberg uncertainty principle to n^(-2 ) , a factor of n smaller than the fundamental limit achievable with non - interacting atoms . we study the effect of decoherence and show that even with decoherence , entangled states can outperform the signal to noise limit of non - entangled states . we present two possible experimental implementations of the method using bose - einstein spinor condensates and fermionic atoms loaded in optical lattices and discuss their advantages and disadvantages .
