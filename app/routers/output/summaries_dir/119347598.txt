we derive the continuous - time limit of discrete quantum walks with topological phases . we show the existence of a continuous - time limit that preserves their topological phases . we consider both simple - step and split - step walks , and derive analytically equations of motion governing their behavior . we obtain simple analytical solutions showing the existence of bound states at the boundary of two phases , and solve the equations of motion numerically in the bulk .
