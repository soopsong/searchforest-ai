carrying out a research program outlined by john s. bell in 1987 , we arrive at a relativistic version of the ghirardi - rimini - weber ( grw ) model of spontaneous wavefunction collapse . the grw model was proposed as a solution of the measurement problem of quantum mechanics and involves a stochastic and nonlinear modification of the schr\"odinger equation . it deviates very little from the schr\"odinger equation for microscopic systems but efficiently suppresses , for macroscopic systems , superpositions of macroscopically different states . as suggested by bell , we take the primitive ontology , or local beables , of our model to be a discrete set of space - time points , at which the collapses are centered . this set is random with distribution determined by the initial wavefunction . our model is nonlocal and violates bell 's inequality though it does not make use of a preferred slicing of space - time or any other sort of synchronization of spacelike separated points . like the grw model , it reproduces the quantum probabilities in all cases presently testable , though it entails deviations from the quantum formalism that are in principle testable . our model works in minkowski space - time as well as in ( well - behaved ) curved background space - times .
