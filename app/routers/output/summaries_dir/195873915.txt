the paradigm of cavity qed is a two - level emitter interacting with a high quality factor single mode optical resonator . the hybridization of the emitter and photon wave functions mandates large vacuum rabi frequencies and long coherence times ; features that so far have been successfully realized with trapped cold atoms and ions and localized solid state quantum emitters such as superconducting circuits , quantum dots , and color centers . thermal atoms on the other hand , provide us with a dense emitter ensemble and in comparison to the cold systems are more compatible with integration , hence enabling large - scale quantum systems . however , their thermal motion and large transit time broadening is a major challenge that has to be circumvented . a promising remedy could benefit from the highly controllable and tunable electromagnetic fields of a nano - photonic cavity with strong local electric - field enhancements . utilizing this feature , here we calculate the interaction between fast moving , thermal atoms and a nano - beam photonic crystal cavity ( pcc ) with large quality factor and small mode volume . through fully quantum mechanical calculations , including casimir - polder potential ( i.e. the effect of the surface on radiation properties of an atom ) we show , when designed properly , the achievable coupling between the flying atom and the cavity photon would be strong enough to lead to rabi flopping in spite of short interaction times . in addition , the time - resolved detection of different trajectories can be used to identify single and multiple atom counts . this probabilistic approach will find applications in cavity qed studies in dense atomic media and paves the way towards realizing coherent quantum control schemes in large - scale macroscopic systems aimed at out of the lab quantum devices .
