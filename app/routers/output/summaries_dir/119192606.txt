we construct nonlinear coherent states or f - deformed coherent states for a nonpolynomial nonlinear oscillator which can be considered as placed in the middle between the harmonic oscillator and the isotonic oscillator ( cari\~nena j f et al , j. phys . a : math . theor . 41 , 085301 ( 2008 ) ) . the deformed annihilation and creation operators which are required to construct the nonlinear coherent states in the number basis are obtained from the solution of the schr\"odinger equation . using these operators , we construct generalized intelligent states , nonlinear coherent states , gazeau - klauder coherent states and the even and odd nonlinear coherent states for this newly solvable system . we also report certain nonclassical properties exhibited by these nonlinear coherent states . in addition to the above , we consider position dependent mass schr\"odinger equation associated with this solvable nonlinear oscillator and construct nonlinear coherent states , gazeau - klauder coherent states and the even and odd nonlinear coherent states for it . we also give explicit expressions of all these nonlinear coherent states by considering a mass profile which is often used for studying transport properties in semiconductors .
