we study the problem of optimal control of dissipative quantum dynamics . although under most circumstances dissipation leads to an increase in entropy ( or a decrease in purity ) of the system , there is an important class of problems for which dissipation with external control can decrease the entropy ( or increase the purity ) of the system . an important example is laser cooling . in such systems , there is an interplay of the hamiltonian part of the dynamics , which is controllable and the dissipative part of the dynamics , which is uncontrollable . the strategy is to control the hamiltonian portion of the evolution in such a way that the dissipation causes the purity of the system to increase rather than decrease . the goal of this paper is to find the strategy that leads to maximal purity at the final time . under the assumption that hamiltonian control is complete and arbitrarily fast , we provide a general framework by which to calculate optimal cooling strategies . these assumptions lead to a great simplification , in which the control problem can be reformulated in terms of the spectrum of eigenvalues of $ \rho$ , rather than $ \rho$ itself . by combining this formulation with the hamilton - jacobi - bellman theorem we are able to obtain an equation for the globaly optimal cooling strategy in terms of the spectrum of the density matrix . for the three - level $ \lambda$ system , we provide a complete analytic solution for the optimal cooling strategy . for this system it is found that the optimal strategy does not exploit system coherences and is a ' greedy ' strategy , in which the purity is increased maximally at each instant .
