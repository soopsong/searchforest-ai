we present an exact model of the detection statistics of a probabilistic source of photon pairs from which a fast , simple and precise method to measure the source 's brightness and photon channel transmissions is demonstrated . we measure such properties for a source based on spontaneous parametric downconversion in a periodically poled linbo$_3 $ crystal producing pairs at 810 and 1550 nm wavelengths . we further validate the model by comparing the predicted and measured values for the $ g^{(2)}(0)$ of a heralded single photon source over a wide range of the brightness . our model is of particular use for monitoring and tuning the brightness on demand as required for various quantum communication applications . we comment on its applicability to sources involving spectral and/or spatial filtering .
