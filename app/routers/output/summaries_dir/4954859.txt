energy transfer plays a vital role in many natural and technological processes . in this work , we study the effects of mechanical motion on the excitation transfer through a chain of interacting molecules with application to biological scenarios of transfer processes . our investigation demonstrates that , for various types of mechanical oscillations , the transfer efficiency is significantly enhanced over that of comparable static configurations . this enhancement is a genuine quantum signature , and requires the collaborative interplay between the quantum - coherent evolution of the excitation and the mechanical motion of the molecules ; it has no analogue in the classical incoherent energy transfer . this effect may not only occur naturally , but it could be exploited in artificially designed systems to optimize transport processes . as an application , we discuss a simple and hence robust control technique .
