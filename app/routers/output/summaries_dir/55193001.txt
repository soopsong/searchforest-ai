we study correlation functions of scalar operators on the boundary of the $ ads_3 $ space deformed by moving massive particles in the context of the ads / cft duality . to calculate two - point correlation functions we use the geodesic approximation and the renormalized image method . we compare results of the renormalized image method with direct calculations using tracing of winding geodesics around the cone singularities , and show on examples that they are equivalent . we demonstrate that in the geodesic approximation the correlators exhibit a zone structure . this structure substantially depends on the mass and velocity of the particle .
