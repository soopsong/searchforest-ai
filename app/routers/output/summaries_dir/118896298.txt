although universal continuous - variable quantum computation can not be achieved via linear optics ( including squeezing ) , homodyne detection and feed - forward , inclusion of ideal photon counting measurements overcomes this obstacle . these measurements are sometimes described by arrays of beam splitters to distribute the photons across several modes . we show that such a scheme can not be used to implement ideal photon counting and that such measurements necessarily involve nonlinear evolution . however , this requirement of nonlinearity can be moved"off - line,"thereby permitting universal continuous - variable quantum computation with linear optics .
