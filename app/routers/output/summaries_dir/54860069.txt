we construct two spin models on lattices ( both two and three - dimensional ) to study the capability of quantum computational power as a function of temperature and the system parameter . there exists a finite region in the phase diagram such that the thermal equilibrium states are capable of providing a universal fault - tolerant resource for measurement - based quantum computation . moreover , in such a region the thermal resource states on the 3d lattices can enable topological protection for quantum computation . the two models behave similarly in terms of quantum computational power . however , they have different properties in terms of the usual phase transitions . the first model has a first - order phase transition only at zero temperature whereas there is no transition at all in the second model . interestingly , the transition in the quantum computational power does not coincide with the phase transition in the first model .
