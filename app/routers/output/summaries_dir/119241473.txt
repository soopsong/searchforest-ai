we consider the inverse eigenvalue problem for entanglement witnesses , which asks for a characterization of their possible spectra ( or equivalently , of the possible spectra resulting from positive linear maps of matrices ) . we completely solve this problem in the two - qubit case and we derive a large family of new necessary conditions on the spectra in arbitrary dimensions . we also establish a natural duality relationship with the set of absolutely separable states , and we completely characterize witnesses ( i.e. , separating hyperplanes ) of that set when one of the local dimensions is 2 .
