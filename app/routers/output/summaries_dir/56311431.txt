we consider a dissipative evolution of parametrically - driven qubits - cavity system under the periodical modulation of coupling energy between two subsystems , which leads to the amplification of counterrotating processes . we reveal a very rich dynamical behavior of this hybrid system . in particular , we find that the energy dissipation in one of the subsystems can enhance quantum effects in another subsystem . for instance , optimal cavity decay assists to stabilize entanglement and quantum correlations between qubits even in the steady state and to compensate finite qubit relaxation . on the contrary , energy dissipation in qubit subsystem results in the enhanced photon production from vacuum for strong modulation , but destroys both quantum concurrence and quantum mutual information between qubits . our results provide deeper insights to nonstationary cavity quantum electrodynamics in context of quantum information processing and might be of importance for dissipative quantum state engineering .
