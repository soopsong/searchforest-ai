we present the design , fabrication , and experimental implementation of surface ion traps with y - shaped junctions . the traps are designed to minimize the pseudopotential variations in the junction region at the symmetric intersection of three linear segments . we experimentally demonstrate robust linear and junction shuttling with greater than one million round - trip shuttles without ion loss . by minimizing the direct line of sight between trapped ions and dielectric surfaces , negligible day - to - day and trap - to - trap variations are observed . in addition to high - fidelity single - ion shuttling , multiple - ion chains survive splitting , ion - position swapping , and recombining routines . the development of two - dimensional trapping structures is an important milestone for ion - trap quantum computing and quantum simulations .
