we consider a physical system which is coupled indirectly to a markovian resevoir through an oscillator mode . this is the case , for example , in the usual model of an atomic sample in a leaky optical cavity which is ubiquitous in quantum optics . in the strong coupling limit the oscillator can be eliminated entirely from the model , leaving an effective direct coupling between the system and the resevoir . here we provide a mathematically rigorous treatment of this limit as a weak limit of the time evolution and observables on a suitably chosen exponential domain in fock space . the resulting effective model may contain emission and absorption as well as scattering interactions .
