we study a quantum otto engine operating on the basis of a helical spin- 1/2 multiferroic chain with strongly coupled magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters . the presence of a finite spin chirality in the working substance enables steering of the cycle by an external electric field that couples to the electric polarization . we observe a direct connection between the chirality , the entanglement and the efficiency of the engine . an electric - field dependent threshold temperature is identified above which the pair correlations in the system , as quantified by the thermal entanglement , diminish . in contrast to the pair correlations , the collective many - body thermal entanglement is less sensitive to the electric field , and in the high temperature limit converges to a constant value . we also discuss the correlations between the threshold temperature of the pair entanglement , the spin chirality and the minimum of the fidelities in relation to the electric and magnetic fields . the efficiency of the quantum otto cycle shows a saturation plateau with increasing electric field amplitude .
