we investigate continuous - time quantum walks of two indistinguishable particles [ bosons , fermions or hard - core bosons ( hcbs ) ] in one - dimensional lattices with nearest - neighbor interactions . the results for two hcbs are well consistent with the recent experimental observation of two - magnon dynamics [ nature 502 , 76 ( 2013 ) ] . the two interacting particles can undergo independent- and/or co - walking depending on both quantum statistics and interaction strength . two strongly interacting particles may form a bound state and then co - walk like a single composite particle with statistics - dependent walk speed . analytical solutions for the scattering and bound states , which appear in the two - particle quantum walks , are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem in the two - particle hilbert space . in the context of degenerate perturbation theory , an effective single - particle model for the quantum co - walking is analytically derived and the walk seep of bosons is found to be exactly three times of the ones of fermions / hcbs . our result paves the way for experimentally exploring quantum statistics via two - particle quantum walks .
