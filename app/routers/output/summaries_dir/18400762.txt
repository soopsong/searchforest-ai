we propose a totally corrective boosting algorithm with explicit cardinality regularization . the resulting combinatorial optimization problems are not known to be efficiently solvable with existing classical methods , but emerging quantum optimization technology gives hope for achieving sparser models in practice . in order to demonstrate the utility of our algorithm , we use a distributed classical heuristic optimizer as a stand - in for quantum hardware . even though this evaluation methodology incurs large time and resource costs on classical computing machinery , it allows us to gauge the potential gains in generalization performance and sparsity of the resulting boosted ensembles . our experimental results on public data sets commonly used for benchmarking of boosting algorithms decidedly demonstrate the existence of such advantages . if actual quantum optimization were to be used with this algorithm in the future , we would expect equivalent or superior results at much smaller time and energy costs during training . moreover , studying cardinality - penalized boosting also sheds light on why unregularized boosting algorithms with early stopping often yield better results than their counterparts with explicit convex regularization : early stopping performs suboptimal cardinality regularization . the results that we present here indicate it is beneficial to explicitly solve the combinatorial problem still left open at early termination .
