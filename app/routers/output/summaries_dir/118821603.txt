we present a generic condition for lorentzian manifolds to have a barrier that limits the reach of boundary - anchored extremal surfaces of arbitrary dimension . we show that any surface with nonpositive extrinsic curvature is a barrier , in the sense that extremal surfaces can not be continuously deformed past it . furthermore , the outermost barrier surface has nonnegative extrinsic curvature . under certain conditions , we show that the existence of trapped surfaces implies a barrier , and conversely . in the context of ads / cft , these barriers imply that it is impossible to reconstruct the entire bulk using extremal surfaces . we comment on the implications for the firewall controversy .
