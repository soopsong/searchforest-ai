we propose a scheme for the detection of quantum phase transitions in the 1d bose - hubbard ( bh ) and 1d extended bose - hubbard ( ebh ) models , using the non - demolition measurement technique of quantum polarization spectroscopy . we use collective measurements of the effective total angular momentum of a particular spatial mode to characterise the mott insulator to superfluid phase transition in the bh model , and the transition to a density wave state in the ebh model . we extend the application of collective measurements to the ground states at various deformations of a super - lattice potential .
