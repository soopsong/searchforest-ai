in a previous paper ( krumm and vogel 2018 phys . rev . a 97 , 043806 ) we presented a method to solve the nonlinear jaynes - cummings dynamics , describing the quantized motion of a trapped ion exactly , including detuning . here we investigate this model with respect to nonclassical effects , such as squeezing and sub - poisson statistics . we show that for the versatile model under study there exist quantum phenomena beyond squeezing and sub - poisson statistics , such as anomalous quantum correlations of two non - commuting observables . in particular , it is shown that for the excitation of the zeroth sideband neither squeezing nor sub - poisson statistics do occur , but anomalous correlations can be verified . furthermore , it is shown how these anomalous correlation functions can be derived from measured data .
