by using an ancilla qubit as a mediator , two distant qubits can undergo a non - local entangling unitary operation . this is desirable for when attempting to scale up or distribute quantum computation by combining fixed static local sets of qubits with ballistic mediators . using a model driven by measurements on the ancilla , it is possible to generate a maximally entangling cz gate while only having access to a less entangling gate between the pair qubits and the ancilla . however this results in a stochastic process of generating control phase rotation gates where the expected time for success does not correlate with the entangling power of the connection gate . we explore how one can use feedback into the preparation and measurement parameters of the ancilla to speed up the expected time to generate a cz gate between a pair of separated qubits and to leverage stronger coupling strengths for faster times . surprisingly , by choosing an appropriate strategy , control of a binary discrete parameter achieves comparable speed up to full continuous control of all degrees of freedom of the ancilla .
