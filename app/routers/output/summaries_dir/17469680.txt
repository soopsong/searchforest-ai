there has been much interest in so - called sic - povms : rank 1 symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measures . in this paper we discuss the larger class of povms which are symmetric and informationally complete but not necessarily rank 1 . this class of povms is of some independent interest . in particular it includes a povm which is closely related to the discrete wigner function . however , it is interesting mainly because of the light it casts on the problem of constructing rank 1 symmetric informationally complete povms . in this connection we derive an extremal condition alternative to the one derived by renes et al .
