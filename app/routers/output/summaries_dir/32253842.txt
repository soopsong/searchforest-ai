this paper presents the first experimental investigation and physical discussion of the cryogenic behavior of a commercial 28 nm bulk cmos technology . here we extract the fundamental physical parameters of this technology at 300 , 77 and 4.2 k based on dc measurement results . the extracted values are then used to demonstrate the impact of cryogenic temperatures on the essential analog design parameters . we find that the simplified charge - based ekv model can accurately predict the cryogenic behavior . this represents a main step towards the design of analog / rf circuits integrated in an advanced bulk cmos process and operating at cryogenic temperature for quantum computing control systems .
