generalized schmidt decomposition of pure three - qubit states has four positive and one complex coefficients . in contrast to the bipartite case , they are not arbitrary and the largest schmidt coefficient restricts severely other coefficients . we derive a nonstrict inequality between three - qubit schmidt coefficients , where the largest coefficient defines the least upper bound for the three nondiagonal coefficients or , equivalently , the three nondiagonal coefficients together define the greatest lower bound for the largest coefficient . in addition , we show the existence of another inequality which should establish an upper bound for the remaining schmidt coefficient .
