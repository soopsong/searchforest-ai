classically , the black hole ( bh ) horizon is a rigid surface of infinite redshift ; whereas the uncertainty principle dictates that the semiclassical ( would - be ) horizon can not be fixed in space nor can it exhibit any divergences . we propose that this distinction underlies the bh information - loss paradox , the apparent absence of bh hair , the so - called trans - planckian problem and the recent"firewall"controversy . we argue that the correct prescription is to first integrate out the fluctuations of the background geometry and only then evaluate matter observables . the basic idea is illustrated using a system of two strongly coupled harmonic oscillators , with the heavier oscillator representing the background . we then apply our proposal to matter fields near a bh horizon , initially treating the matter fields as classical and the background as semiclassical . in this case , the average value of the associated current does not vanish ; so that it is possible , in principle , to measure the global charge of the bh . then the matter is , in addition to the background , treated quantum mechanically . we show that the average energy density of matter as seen by an asymptotic observer is finite and proportional to the bh entropy , rather than divergent . we discuss the implications of our results for the various controversial issues concerning bh physics .
