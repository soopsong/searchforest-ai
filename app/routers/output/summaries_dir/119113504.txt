we propose an analysis of the time - optimal control of a dissipative two - level quantum system whose dynamics is governed by the lindblad equation . this simple system allows one to use tools of geometric control theory and to construct its optimal synthesis , i.e. to determine the set of all the optimal trajectories starting from a given initial point . we study different processes such as conversion of a pure state into a mixed state and purification of a mixed state . in particular cases , we show that dissipation is not undesirable and can help accelerating the control .
