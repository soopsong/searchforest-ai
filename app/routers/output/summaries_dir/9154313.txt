in this paper we present a linear quadratic gaussian ( lqg ) feedback control strategy for a class of linear non - markovian quantum systems . the feedback control law is designed based on the estimated states of a whitening quantum filter for an augmented markovian model of the non - markovian open quantum systems . in this augmented markovian model , an ancillary system plays the role of internal modes of the environment converting white noise into lorentzian noise and a principal system obeys non - markovian dynamics due to the direct interaction with the ancillary system . the simulation results show the lqg controller with the whitening filter obtains a better control performance than that with a markovian filter in the problem of minimizing the photon numbers of the principal system when the ancillary system is disturbed by thermal noise .
