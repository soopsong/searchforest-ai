both classical and quantum dynamics of the synchronization between two nonlinear mechanical modes scattered from bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) by the standing - wave laser beam are comparatively investigated . as the ultra - low dissipations of the momentum modes in the atomic becs , the synchronized dynamics are studied in a framework of closed - system theory in order to track down both the classical and the quantum synchronizations from an angle of quantum control . the classical synchronization and the relevant dynamics of measure synchronization , the quantum synchronization and two different types of measures proposed by mari and estimated by mutual information based on $ q$-function are studied respectively in order to reveal both the macroscopic and the microscopic signatures of synchronized behaviors in a closed quantum system . the results demonstrate that the"revival and collapse"of the quantum fluctuations beyond the classical mean - value dynamics due to long - lasting mode coherence discriminates the quantum synchronization from the classical one , which not only excludes the possibilities of an exact synchronization and a perfect density overlap in phase space , but also leads to upper limitations to mari measure and large unceasing fluctuations to mutual information between two scattering modes . we reveal a close dynamic connection between mari measure and the mutual information of two nonlinear momentum modes in closed bec systems by demonstrating an opposite mean - value behavior but a similar fluctuation variation with respect to their respective evolutionary scales .
