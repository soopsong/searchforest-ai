the recently proposed er = epr correspondence postulates the existence of wormholes ( einstein - rosen bridges ) between entangled states ( such as epr pairs ) . entanglement is famously known to be unobservable in quantum mechanics , in that there exists no observable ( or , equivalently , projector ) that can accurately pick out whether a generic state is entangled . many features of the geometry of spacetime , however , are observables , so one might worry that the presence or absence of a wormhole could identify an entangled state in er = epr , violating quantum mechanics , specifically , the property of state - independence of observables . in this note , we establish that this can not occur : there is no measurement in general relativity that unambiguously detects the presence of a generic wormhole geometry . this statement is the er = epr dual of the undetectability of entanglement .
