the understanding of out - of - equilibrium physics , especially dynamic instabilities and dynamic phase transitions , is one of the major challenges of contemporary science , spanning the broadest wealth of research areas that range from quantum optics to living organisms . focusing on nonequilibrium dynamics of an open dissipative spin system , we introduce a non - hermitian hamiltonian approach , in which non - hermiticity reflects dissipation and deviation from equilibrium . the imaginary part of the proposed spin hamiltonian describes the effects of gilbert damping and applied slonczewski spin - transfer torque . in the classical limit , our approach reproduces landau - lifshitz - gilbert - slonczewski dynamics of a large macrospin . we reveal the spin - transfer torque - driven parity - time symmetry - breaking phase transition corresponding to a transition from precessional to exponentially damped spin dynamics . micromagnetic simulations for nanoscale ferromagnetic disks demonstrate the predicted effect . our findings can pave the way to a general quantitative description of out - of - equilibrium phase transitions driven by spontaneous parity - time symmetry breaking .
