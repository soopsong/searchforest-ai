resilience to noise and to decoherence processes is an important ingredient for the implementation of quantum information processing , and quantum technologies . to this end , techniques such as pulsed and continuous dynamical decoupling have been proposed to reduce noise effects . in this paper , we suggest a new approach to implementing continuous dynamical decoupling techniques , that uses an extra control parameter ; namely , the ability to shape the time dependence of the detuning . this approach reduces the complexity of the experimental setup , such that we are only left with noise originating from the frequency of the driving field , which is much more robust than the amplitude ( rabi frequency ) noise . as an example , we show that our technique can be utilized for improved sensing .
