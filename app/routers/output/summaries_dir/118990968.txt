it has recently been pointed out that the geometric quantum discord , as defined by the hilbert - schmidt norm ( 2-norm ) , is not a good measure of quantum correlations , since it may increase under local reversible operations on the unmeasured subsystem . here , we revisit the geometric discord by considering general schatten p - norms , explicitly showing that the 1-norm is the only p - norm able to define a consistent quantum correlation measure . in addition , by restricting the optimization to the tetrahedron of two - qubit bell - diagonal states , we provide an analytical expression for the 1-norm geometric discord , which turns out to be equivalent to the negativity of quantumness . we illustrate the measure by analyzing its monotonicity properties .
