we investigate system - environment correlations based on the exact dynamics of a qubit and its environment in the framework of pure decoherence ( phase damping ) . we focus on the relation of decoherence and the build - up of system - reservoir entanglement for an arbitrary ( possibly mixed ) initial qubit state . in the commonly employed regime where the qubit dynamics can be described by a markov master equation of lindblad type , we find that for almost all qubit initial states inside the bloch sphere , decoherence is complete while the total state is still separable - no entanglement is involved . in general , both"separable"and"entangling"decoherence occurs , depending on temperature and initial qubit state . moreover , we find situations where classical and quantum correlations periodically alternate as a function of time in the regime of low temperatures .
