it has been conjectured that the dual of the eternal black hole in ads is two entangled but disconnected cfts . we show that the entanglement created by the process of hawking radiation creates several challenges for this conjecture . the nature of fuzzball states suggests a different picture , where the dual to two entangled cfts is two entangled but disconnected spacetimes . we argue for a process of ` quick tunneling ' where the einstein - rosen bridge of the eternal hole tunnels rapidly into fuzzball states , preventing the existence of the eternal hole as a semiclassical spacetime . the regions behind the horizon then emerge only in the approximation of fuzzball complementarity , where one considers the impact of probes with energy $ e\gg t$.
