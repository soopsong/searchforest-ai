security proofs of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) systems usually assume that the users have access to source of perfect randomness . state - of - the - art qkd systems run at frequencies in the ghz range , requiring a sustained ghz rate of generation and acquisition of quantum random numbers . in this paper we demonstrate such a high speed random number generator . the entropy source is based on amplified spontaneous emission from an erbium - doped fibre , which is directly acquired using a standard small form - factor pluggable ( sfp ) module . the module connects to the field programmable gate array ( fpga ) of a qkd system . a real - time randomness extractor is implemented in the fpga and achieves a sustained rate of 1.25 gbps of provably random bits .
