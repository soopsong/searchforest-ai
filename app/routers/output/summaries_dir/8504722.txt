the quantum fourier transform ( qft ) , a quantum analog of the classical fourier transform , has been shown to be a powerful tool in developing quantum algorithms . however , in classical computing there is another class of unitary transforms , the wavelet transforms , which are every bit as useful as the fourier transform . wavelet transforms are used to expose the multi - scale structure of a signal and are likely to be useful for quantum image processing and quantum data compression . in this paper , we derive efficient , complete , quantum circuits for two representative quantum wavelet transforms , the quantum haar and quantum daubechies $ d^{(4)}$ transforms . our approach is to factor the operators for these transforms into direct sums , direct products and dot products of unitary matrices . in so doing , we find that permutation matrices , a particular class of unitary matrices , play a pivotal role . surprisingly , we find that operations that are easy and inexpensive to implement classically are not always easy and inexpensive to implement quantum mechanically , and vice versa . in particular , the computational cost of performing certain permutation matrices is ignored classically because they can be avoided explicitly . however , quantum mechanically , these permutation operations must be performed explicitly and hence their cost enters into the full complexity measure of the quantum transform . we consider the particular set of permutation matrices arising in quantum wavelet transforms and develop efficient quantum circuits that implement them . this allows us to design efficient , complete quantum circuits for the quantum wavelet transform .
