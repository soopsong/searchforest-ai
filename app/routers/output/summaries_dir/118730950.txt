we consider the light scattering from ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice inside a cavity . in such a system , both the light and atomic motion should be treated in a fully quantum mechanical way . the unitary evolution of the light - matter quantum state is shown to demonstrate the non - trivial phase dependence , quadratic in the atom number . this is essentially due to the dynamical self - consistent nature of the light modes assumed in our model . the collapse of the quantum state during the photocounting process is analyzed as well . it corresponds to the measurement - induced atom number squeezing . we show that , at the final stage of the state collapse , the shrinking of the width of the atom number distribution behaves exponentially in time . this is much faster than the square root time dependence , obtained for the initial stage of the state collapse . the exponentially fast squeezing appears due to the discrete nature of the atom number distribution .
