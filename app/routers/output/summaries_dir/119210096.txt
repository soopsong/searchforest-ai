the purpose of this paper is to set out the problems of modeling quantum communication and signal processing where the communication between systems via a non - markovian channel . this is a general feature of quantum transmission lines . our ultimate objective is to extend the networks rules that have been developed for markovian models . to this end we recall the hamiltonian description of such non - markov models of transmission lines and their quantization . these have occurred in the context of non - quilibrium thermodynamics , but our interest is in the transmission lines as carriers of information rather than heat baths . we show that there is an analytic scattering matrix associated with these models and that stability may be formulated in terms of the lossless bounded real property . noting that the input and output fields do not separately satisfy a non - self- demolition principle , we discuss the rigorous limit in which such models appear markov and so amenable to standard approaches of quantum filtering and control
