taking into account the density matrices with non - full ranks , we show that the fidelity susceptibility is determined by the support of the density matrix . combining with the corresponding expression of the quantum fisher information , we rigorously prove that the fidelity susceptibility is proportional to the quantum fisher information . as this proof can be naturally extended to the full rank case , this proportional relation is generally established for density matrices with arbitrary ranks . furthermore , we give an analytical expression of the quantum fisher information matrix , and show that the quantum fisher information matrix can also be represented in the density matrix 's support .
