we report the realization of a new polarization entangled photon - pair source based on a titanium - indiffused waveguide integrated on periodically poled lithium niobate pumped by a cw laser at $ 655 nm$. the paired photons are emitted at the telecom wavelength of $ 1310 nm$ within a bandwidth of $ 0.7 nm$. the quantum properties of the pairs are measured using a two - photon coalescence experiment showing a visibility of 85 % . the evaluated source brightness , on the order of $ 10 ^ 5 $ pairs $ s^{-1 } ghz^{-1 } mw^{-1}$ , associated with its compactness and reliability , demonstrates the source 's high potential for long - distance quantum communication .
