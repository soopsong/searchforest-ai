we introduce an experimentally accessible method to measure a unique degree of nonclassicality , based on the quantum superposition principle , for arbitrary quantum states . we formulate witnesses and test a given state for any particular value of this measure . the construction of optimal tests is presented as well as the general numerical implementation . we apply this approach on examples such as squeezed states , and we show how to formulate conditions to certify a particular degree of nonclassicality for single- and multimode radiation fields .
