satellites are the efficient way to achieve global scale quantum communication ( q.com ) because unavoidable losses restrict fiber based q.com to a few hundred kilometers . we demonstrate the feasibility of establishing a q.com uplink with a tiny 3u cubesat ( measuring just 10x10x32 cm^3 ) using commercial off - the - shelf components , the majority of which have space heritage . we demonstrate how to leverage the latest advancements in nano - satellite body - pointing to show that our 4 kg cubesat can provide performance comparable to much larger 600 kg satellite missions . a comprehensive link budget and simulation was performed to calculate the secure key rates . we discuss design choices and trade - offs to maximize the key rate while minimizing the cost and development needed . our detailed design and feasibility study can be readily used as a template for global scale q.com .
