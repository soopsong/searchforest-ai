at present , the problem to steer a non - markovian process with minimum energy between specified end - point marginal distributions remains unsolved . herein , we consider the special case for a non - markovian process y(t ) which , however , assumes a finite - dimensional stochastic realization with a markov state process that is fully observable . in this setting , and over a finite time horizon [ 0,t ] , we determine an optimal ( least ) finite - energy control law that steers the stochastic system to a final distribution that is compatible with a specified distribution for the terminal output process y(t ) ; the solution is given in closed - form . this work provides a key step towards the important problem to steer a stochastic system based on partial observations of the state ( i.e. , an output process ) corrupted by noise , which will be the subject of forthcoming work .
