sensors that harness exclusively quantum phenomena ( such as entanglement ) can achieve superior performance compared to those employing only classical principles . recently , a technique based on postselected , weakly - performed measurements has emerged as a method of overcoming technical noise in the detection and estimation of small interaction parameters , particularly in optical systems . the question of which other types of noise may be combatted remains open . we here analyze whether the effect can overcome decoherence in a typical field sensing scenario . benchmarking a weak , postselected measurement strategy against a strong , direct strategy we conclude that no advantage is achievable , and that even a small amount of decoherence proves catastrophic to the weak - value amplification technique .
