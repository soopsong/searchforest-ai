this paper is concerned with stochastic hamiltonian systems which model a class of open dynamical systems subject to random external forces . their dynamics are governed by ito stochastic differential equations whose structure is specified by a hamiltonian , viscous damping parameters and system - environment coupling functions . we consider energy balance relations for such systems with an emphasis on linear stochastic hamiltonian ( lsh ) systems with quadratic hamiltonians and linear coupling . for lsh systems , we also discuss stability conditions , the structure of the invariant measure and its relation with stochastic versions of the virial theorem . using lyapunov functions , organised as deformed hamiltonians , dissipation relations are also considered for lsh systems driven by statistically uncertain external forces . an application of these results to feedback connections of lsh systems is outlined .
