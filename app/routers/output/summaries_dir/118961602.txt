the coherence properties of mechanical resonators are often limited by multiple unavoidable forms of loss -- including phonon - phonon and phonon - defect scattering -- which result in the scattering of sound into other resonant modes and into the phonon bath . dynamic suppression of this scattering loss can lift constraints on device structure and can improve tolerance to defects in the material , even after fabrication . inspired by recent experiments , here we introduce a model of phonon losses resulting from disorder in a whispering gallery mode resonator with acousto - optical coupling between optical and mechanical modes . we show that a typical elastic scattering mechanism of high quality factor ( q ) mechanical modes flips the direction of phonon propagation via high - angle scattering , leading to damping into modes with the opposite parity . when the optical mode overlaps co - propagating high - q and bulk mechanical modes , the addition of laser cooling via sideband - resolved damping of the mechanical mode of a chosen parity also damps and modifies the response of the bulk modes of the same parity . this , in turn , simultaneously improves the quality factor and reduces the thermal load of the counter - propagating high - q modes , leading to the dynamical creation of a cold phononic shield . we compare our theoretical results to the recent experiments of kim et al . , and find quantitative agreement with our theory .
