quantum error correction will be a necessary component towards realizing scalable quantum computers with physical qubits . theoretically , it is possible to perform arbitrarily long computations if the error rate is below a threshold value . the two - dimensional surface code permits relatively high fault - tolerant thresholds at the ~1 % level , and only requires a latticed network of qubits with nearest - neighbor interactions . superconducting qubits have continued to steadily improve in coherence , gate , and readout fidelities , to become a leading candidate for implementation into larger quantum networks . here we describe characterization experiments and calibration of a system of four superconducting qubits arranged in a planar lattice , amenable to the surface code . insights into the particular qubit design and comparison between simulated parameters and experimentally determined parameters are given . single- and two - qubit gate tune - up procedures are described and results for simultaneously benchmarking pairs of two - qubit gates are given . all controls are eventually used for an arbitrary error detection protocol described in separate work [ corcoles et al . , nature communications , 6 , 2015 ]
