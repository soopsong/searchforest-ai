simulations of standard 1d and 2d quantum walks have been performed within quantum computer simulator ( qcs system ) environment and with the use of gpu supported by cuda technology . in particular , simulations of quantum walks may be seen as an appropriate benchmarks for testing calculational power of the processors used . it was demonstrated by a series of tests that the use of cuda based technology radically increases the computational power compared to the standard cpu based computations .
