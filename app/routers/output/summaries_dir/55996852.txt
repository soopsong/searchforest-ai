device - independent quantum key distribution ( diqkd ) in its current design requires a violation of bell 's inequality between two honest parties , alice and bob , who are connected by a quantum channel . however , in reality , quantum channels are lossy , and this can be exploited for attacks based on the detection loophole . here , we propose a novel approach to diqkd that overcomes this limitation . in particular , based on a combination between an entropic uncertainty relation and the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) test , we design a diqkd protocol where the chsh test is carried out entirely in alice 's laboratory . thus the loophole caused by channel losses is avoided .
