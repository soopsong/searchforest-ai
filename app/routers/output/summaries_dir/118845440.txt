we construct photon modulated coherent states of a generalized isotonic oscillator by expanding the newly introduced superposed operator through weyl ordering method . we evaluate the parameter $ a_3 $ and the $ s$-parameterized quasi probability distribution function to confirm the non - classical nature of the states . we also calculate the identities related with the quadrature squeezing to explore the squeezing property of the states . finally , we investigate the fidelity between the photon modulated coherent states and coherent states to quantify the non - gaussianity of the states . the constructed states and their associated non - classical properties will add further knowledge on the potential .
