we study phonon statistics in a nanomechanical resonator ( namr ) which is resonantly coupled to a qubit . we find that there are two different mechanisms for phonon blockade in such a resonantly coupled namr - qubit system . one is due to the strong anharmonicity of the namr - qubit system with large coupling strength ; the other one is due to the destructive interference between different paths for two - phonon excitation in the namr - qubit system with a moderate coupling strength . we find that the phonon blockade is fragile towards thermal mode occupations and can only be observed for namr being at ultracold effective temperature . in order to enlarge the mean phonon number for strong phonon antibunching with a moderate namr - qubit coupling strength , we assume that two external driving fields are applied to the namr and qubit , respectively . in this case , we find that the phonon blockades under two mechanisms can appear at the same frequency regime by optimizing the strength ratio and phase difference of the two external driving fields .
