the past of the photon in a nested mach - zehnder interferometer with an inserted dove prism is analyzed . it is argued that the dove prism does not change the past of the photon . alonso and jordan correctly point out that an experiment by danan et al . demonstrating the past of the photon in nested interferometer will show different results when the dove prism is inserted . the reason , however , is not that the past is changed , but that the experimental demonstration becomes incorrect . the explanation of a signal from the place in which the photon was ( almost ) not present is given . bohmian trajectory of the photon is specified .
