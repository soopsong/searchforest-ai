in this study , a distinctive feature of quantum computation ( qc ) is characterized . to this end , a seemingly - powerful classical computing model , called"stochastic ensemble machine ( senm),"is considered . the senm runs with an ensemble consisting of finite copies of a single probabilistic machine , hence is as powerful as a probabilistic turing machine ( ptm ) . then the hypothesis -- that is , the senm can effectively simulate a general circuit model of qc -- is tested by introducing an information - theoretic inequality , named readout inequality . the inequality is satisfied by the senm and imposes a critical condition : if the hypothesis holds , the inequality should be satisfied by the probing model of qc . however , it is shown that the above hypothesis is not generally accepted with the inequality violation , namely , such a simulation necessarily fails , implying that ptm $ \subseteq$ qc .
