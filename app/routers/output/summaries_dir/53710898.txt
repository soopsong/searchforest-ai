we investigate a two - level unruh - dewitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field or its proper time derivative in $ ( 1 + 1)$-dimensional minkowski spacetime , in a quantum state whose correlation structure across the rindler horizon mimics the stationary aspects of a firewall that almheiri et al have argued to ensue in an evaporating black hole spacetime . within first - order perturbation theory , we show that the detector 's response on falling through the horizon is sudden but finite . the difference from the minkowski vacuum response is proportional to $ \omega^{-2}\ln(|\omega|)$ for the non - derivative detector and to $ \ln(|\omega|)$ for the derivative - coupling detector , both in the limit of a large energy gap $ \omega$ and in the limit of adiabatic switching . adding to the quantum state high rindler temperature excitations behind the horizon increases the detector 's response proportionally to the temperature ; this situation has been suggested to model the energetic curtain proposal of braunstein et al . we speculate that the $ ( 1 + 1)$-dimensional derivative - coupling detector may be a good model for a non - derivative detector that crosses a firewall in $ 3 + 1 $ dimensions .
