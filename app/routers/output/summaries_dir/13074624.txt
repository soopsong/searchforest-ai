the main advantage of quantum metrology relies on the effective use of entanglement , which indeed allows us to achieve strictly better estimation performance over the standard quantum limit . in this paper , we propose an analogous method uti- lizing entanglement for the purpose of feedback control . the system considered is a general linear dynamical quantum system , where the control goal can be systemati- cally formulated as a linear quadratic gaussian control problem based on the quantum kalman filtering method ; in this setting , an entangled input probe field is effectively used to reduce the estimation error and accordingly the control cost function . in par- ticular , we show that , in the problem of cooling an opto - mechanical oscillator , the entanglement - assisted feedback control can lower the stationary occupation number of the oscillator below the limit attainable by the controller with a coherent probe field and furthermore beats the controller with an optimized squeezed probe field .
