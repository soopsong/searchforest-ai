the quantum teleportation with noisy epr state is discussed . using an optimal decomposition technique , we compute the concurrence , entanglement of formation and groverian measure for various noisy epr resources . it is shown analytically that all entanglement measures reduce to zero when $ \bar{f } \leq 2/3 $ , where $ \bar{f}$ is an average fidelity between alice and bob . this fact indicates that the entanglement is a genuine physical resource for the teleportation process . this fact gives valuable clues on the optimal decomposition for higher - qubit mixed states . as an example , the optimal decompositions for the three - qubit mixed states are discussed by adopting a teleportation with w - state
