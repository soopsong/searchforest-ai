we investigate the detection problem of quantum nonlocal correlation by two qubit detectors . the detectors with an initial product state interact with a massless scalar field in the vacuum state , and then the out - state of the detectors are correlated after the interaction . under the perturbative treatment in the second order of the coupling , the detectors ' state can be entangled but satisfies the bell - chsh inequality . it is known that the violation of the bell - chsh inequality for such an entangled state is obtained after a local filtering operation . in this paper , we construct the optimal filtering operation for the qubit detectors and derive the success probability of the filtering operation , which characterizes the reliability of revealing the bell - chsh nonlocality by the filtering operations . by applying the optimal filtering , it is shown that the detected bell - chsh nonlocality depends on the coherence of the detectors ' state and the spontaneous emission of scalar particles from each detector . we also comment on a trade - off relation between the success probability and the size of the parameter region showing quantum correlation .
