the aim of this paper is to discuss new results concerning some kinds of parametric extended entropies and divergences . as a result of our studies for mathematical properties on entropy and divergence , we give new bounds for the tsallis quasilinear entropy and divergence by applying the hermite - hadamard inequality . we also give bounds for biparametrical extended entropies and divergences which have been given in \cite{7 } . in addition , we study $ ( r , q)$-quasilinear entropies and divergences as alternative biparametrical extended entropy and divergence , and then we give bounds for them . finally we obtain inequalities for an extended lin 's divergence and some characterizations of fermi - dirac entropy and bose - einstein entropy .
