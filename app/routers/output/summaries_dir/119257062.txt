the development of si$_3$n$_4 $ nanobeam optomechanical crystals is reviewed . these structures consist of a 350 nm thick , 700 nm wide doubly - clamped si$_3$n$_4 $ nanobeam that is periodically patterned with an array of air holes to which a defect region is introduced . the periodic patterning simultaneously creates a photonic bandgap for 980 nm band photons and a phononic bandgap for 4 ghz phonons , with the defect region serving to co - localize optical and mechanical modes within their respective bandgaps . these optical and mechanical modes interact dispersively with a coupling rate $ g_{0}/2\pi\approx$100 khz , which describes the shift in cavity mode optical frequency due to the zero - point motion of the mechanical mode . optical sidebands generated by interaction with the mechanical mode lie outside of the optical cavity linewidth , enabling possible use of this system in applications requiring sideband - resolved operation . along with a review of the basic device design , fabrication , and measurement procedures , we present new results on improved optical quality factors ( up to $ 4\times10 ^ 5 $ ) through optimized lithography , measurements of devices after hf acid surface treatment , and temperature dependent measurements of mechanical damping between 6~k and 300~k . a frequency - mechanical quality factor product $ \left(f{\times}q_m\right)$ as high as $ \approx2.6\times10^{13}$ hz is measured .
