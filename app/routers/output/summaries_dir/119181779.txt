in this chapter we review the use of semiconductor quantum dots as sources of quantum light . principally , we focus on resonant two - photon excitation , which is a method that allows for on - demand generation of photon pairs . we explore the advantages of resonant excitation and present a number of measurements that were made in this excitation regime . in particular , we cover the following topics : photon statistics , coherent manipulation of the ground - excited state superposition , and generation of time - bin entangled photon pairs .
