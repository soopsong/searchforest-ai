quantum cellular automata have been recently considered as a fundamental approach to quantum field theory , resorting to a precise automaton , linear in the field , for the dirac equation in one dimension . in such linear case a quantum automaton is isomorphic to a quantum walk , and a convenient formulation can be given in terms of transition matrices , leading to a new kind of discrete path integral that we solve analytically in terms of jacobi polynomials versus the arbitrary mass parameter .
