networks with memristive elements ( resistors with memory ) are being explored for a variety of applications ranging from unconventional computing to models of the brain . however , analytical results that highlight the role of the graph connectivity on the memory dynamics are still a few , thus limiting our understanding of these important dynamical systems . in this paper , we derive an exact matrix equation of motion that takes into account all the network constraints of a purely memristive circuit , and we employ it to derive analytical results regarding its relaxation properties . we are able to describe the memory evolution in terms of orthogonal projection operators onto the subspace of fundamental loop space of the underlying circuit . this orthogonal projection explicitly reveals the coupling between the spatial and temporal sectors of the memristive circuits and compactly describes the circuit topology . for the case of disordered graphs , we are able to explain the emergence of a power law relaxation as a superposition of exponential relaxation times with a broad range of scales using random matrices . this power law is also { \it universal } , namely independent of the topology of the underlying graph but dependent only on the density of loops . in the case of circuits subject to alternating voltage instead , we are able to obtain an approximate solution of the dynamics , which is tested against a specific network topology . these result suggest a much richer dynamics of memristive networks than previously considered .
