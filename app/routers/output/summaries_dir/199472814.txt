single photon sources are necessary for optical quantum technology . the nonclassicality of emitted single photons manifests itself in diverse experiments and applications . the applications already require different nonclassical aspects of single photons , however , a suitable hierarchy of criteria is missing . we propose variable experimental tests , based on adjustable linear optical networks and single photon detectors , giving a hierarchy of such nonclassicality criteria . the hierarchy goes beyond hanbury - brown - twiss test of photon antibunching and allows us to compare faithfully quality and performance of single - photon sources via their nonclassical properties .
