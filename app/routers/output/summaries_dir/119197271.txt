in contrast to recent studies [ rabl , phys . rev . lett . 107 , 063601 ( 2011 ) ; nunnenkamp et al . , phys . rev . lett . 107 , 063602 ( 2011 ) ] on photon blockade that prevents subsequent photons from resonantly entering the cavity in optomechanical systems , we study the photon - induced tunneling that increases the probability of admitting subsequent photons in those systems . in particular , we analytically and numerically show how twoor three - photon tunneling can occur by avoiding single - photon blockade . our study provides another way on photon control using a single mechanical resonator in optomechanical systems .
