we design a resistive heater optimized for efficient and low - loss optical phase modulation in a silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) waveguide and characterize the fabricated devices . modulation is achieved by flowing current perpendicular to a new ridge waveguide geometry . the resistance profile is engineered using different dopant concentrations to obtain localized heat generation and maximize the overlap between the optical mode and the high temperature regions , while simultaneously minimizing optical loss due to free - carrier absorption . a 61.6 micrometer - long phase shifter was fabricated in a cmos process with oxide cladding and two metal layers . the device features a phase - shifting efficiency of 24.77 + /- 0.43 mw / pi and a -3 db modulation bandwidth of 130.0 + /- 5.59 khz . the insertion loss measured for 21 devices across an 8-inch wafer was only 0.23 + /- 0.13 db . considering the prospect of densely integrated photonic circuits , we also quantify the separation necessary to isolate thermo - optic devices in the standard 220 nm soi platform .
