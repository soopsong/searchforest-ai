distillation , which generally means converting noisy states into better approximations of some valuable pure states by low - cost operations , is a fundamental type of resource trading protocol that plays major roles in quantum computation and information processing . in this work , we establish a series of fundamental limitations to the efficiency of distillation with finite resources which apply to any reasonable resource theory , using an information - theoretic tool called the quantum hypothesis testing relative entropy . we show that , for highly generic noisy inputs and any target pure resource state , there is an insuperable limitation to the accuracy ( lower bound on the error ) of any distillation protocol , even probabilistic ones . more explicitly , we prove an"uncertainty relation"between the accuracy and success probability , which indicates a forbidden regime that no protocol with the corresponding parameters can exist . we use these no - go theorems to derive explicit bounds which imply that the total overhead i.e. the number of noisy inputs required to distill a pure resource state up to small error $ \epsilon$ scale at least as $ \omega(\log(1/\epsilon))$. in particular , we establish specific lower bounds on the cost of magic state distillation , a task crucial to fault - tolerant quantum computation ( which address an open problem raised by hastings and haah [ prl 120 , 050504 ( 2018 ) ] ) . finally , we showcase a basic no - go result for simulating unitary resource channels to demonstrate that the analogous understandings may extend to channel resource theories .
