for the quantum correlations between scattered modes in the disordered media , the previous works focus mainly on the cases where the inputs are non - superposed states , for instance , products of fock states [ phys . rev . letts . 105 ( 2010 ) 090501 ] . a natural question that arises is how the superpositions affect the quantum correlations . following this trail , the comparison between superpositions and products of fock states is performed . it is found an interesting phenomenon that for the superposition and the corresponding product of fock state ( non - gaussian states ) , their averaged quantum correlations are nearly same , whereas the distributions of their quantum correlations might be different . therefore , superpositions may affect the distributions of the quantum correlations . in addition , to examine how the gaussian states affect the quantum correlations , we compare the typical gaussian states with the non - gaussian states ( superpositions and products of fock states ) . it is discovered that the non - gaussian - state input could result in the quantum correlation that is either positive or negative , depending on the number of the input modes and the number of the photons in each mode , whereas the gaussian - state input always leads to the non - negative quantum correlation . besides , it is demonstrated that with the increase of the disorder strength , the mean strength of the quantum correlation increases for multi - mode - state inputs ( except for multi - mode - coherent - state inputs ) . these results may be useful to control and adjust the quantum properties of scattered modes after the quantized lights propagating through the disordered medium .
