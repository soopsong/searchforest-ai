light enables manipulating many - body states of matter , and atoms trapped in optical lattices is a prominent example . however , quantum properties of light are completely neglected in all quantum gas experiments . extending methods of quantum optics to many - body physics will enable phenomena unobtainable in classical optical setups . we show how using the quantum optical feedback creates strong correlations in bosonic and fermionic systems . it balances two competing processes , originating from different fields : quantum backaction of weak optical measurement and many - body dynamics , resulting in stabilized density waves , antiferromagnetic and noon states . our approach is extendable to other systems promising for quantum technologies .
