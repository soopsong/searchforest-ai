we demonstrate the design of an integrated conditional quantum teleportation circuit and a readout circuit using a two - dimensional photonic crystal single chip . fabrication and testing of the proposed quantum circuit can be accomplished with current or near future semiconductor process technology and experimental techniques . the readout part of our device , which has potential for independent use as an atomic interferometer , can also be used on its own or integrated with other compatible optical circuits to achieve atomic state detection . further improvement of the device in terms of compactness and robustness could be achieved by integrating it with sources and detectors in the optical regime .
