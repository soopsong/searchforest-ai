we show that , by treating the gravitational interaction between two mechanical resonators as a classical measurement channel , a gravitational decoherence model results that is equivalent to a model first proposed by diosi . the resulting decoherence model implies that the classically mediated gravitational interaction between two gravitationally coupled resonators can not create entanglement . the gravitational decoherence rate ( and the complementary heating rate ) is of the order of the gravitationally induced normal mode splitting of the two resonators .
