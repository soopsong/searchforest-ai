at the core of an ideal single photon detector is an active material that ideally absorbs and converts photons to discriminable electronic signals . a large active material volume favours high - efficiency absorption , but often at the expense of conversion efficiency , noise , speed and timing accuracy . the present work demonstrates how the concept of coherent perfect absorption can be used to relax this trade - off for a waveguide - integrated superconducting nanowire single photon detector . a very short ( 8.5$\mu$m long ) and narrow ( 8$\times$35nm$^2 $ ) u - shaped nbtin nanowire atop a silicon - on - insulator waveguide is turned into a perfect absorber by etching an asymmetric nanobeam cavity around it . at 2.05k , the detectors show $ \sim$96$\pm$12 % on - chip quantum efficiency for 1545 nm photons with an intrinsic dark count rate $ < $ 0.1hz . the estimated timing jitter is $ \sim$53ps full - width at half - maximum and the reset time is $ < $ 7ns , both extrinsically limited by readout electronics . this architecture is capable of pushing ultra - compact detector performance to ideal limits , and so promises to find a myriad of applications in quantum optics .
