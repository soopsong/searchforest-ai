for the last 20 years , the question of what are the fundamental capabilities of quantum precision measurements has sparked a lively debate throughout the scientific community . typically , the ultimate limits in quantum metrology are associated with the notion of the heisenberg limit expressed in terms of the physical resources used in the measurement procedure . over the years , a variety of different physical resources were introduced , leading to a confusion about the meaning of the heisenberg limit . here , we review the mainstream definitions of the relevant resources and introduce the universal resource count , that is , the expectation value of the generator ( above its ground state ) of translations in the parameter we wish to estimate , that applies to all measurement strategies . this leads to the ultimate formulation of the heisenberg limit for quantum metrology . we prove that the new limit holds for the generators of translations with an upper - bounded spectrum .
