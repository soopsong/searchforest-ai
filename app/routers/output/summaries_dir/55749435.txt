silicon vacancy ( siv ) centers in diamonds have emerged as a very promising candidate for quantum emitter due to their narrow emission line resulting in their indistinguishability . while many different quantum emitters have already been used for excitation of various propagating plasmonic modes , the corresponding exploitation of siv centers remained so far uncharted territory . here , we report on excitation of surface plasmon modes supported by silver nanowires using siv centers in nanodiamonds . the coupling of siv center fluorescence to surface plasmons is observed , when a nanodiamond situated close to a nanowire is illuminated by the pump , as radiated emission from the distal nanowire end . the effect of coupling is also seen as a change in the siv center lifetime . finally , we discuss possible avenues for strengthening the siv center coupling to surface plasmon modes .
