the power of matrix product states to describe infinite - size translational - invariant critical spin chains is investigated . at criticality , the accuracy with which they describe ground state properties of a system is limited by the size $ \chi$ of the matrices that form the approximation . this limitation is quantified in terms of the scaling of the half - chain entanglement entropy . in the case of the quantum ising model , we find $ s \sim { 1/6}\log \chi$ with high precision . this result can be understood as the emergence of an effective finite correlation length $ \xi_\chi$ ruling of all the scaling properties in the system . we produce five extra pieces of evidence for this finite-$\chi$ scaling , namely , the scaling of the correlation length , the scaling of magnetization , the shift of the critical point , and the scaling of the entanglement entropy for a finite block of spins . all our computations are consistent with a scaling relation of the form $ \xi_\chi\sim \chi^{\kappa}$ , with $ \kappa=2 $ for the ising model . in the case of the heisenberg model , we find similar results with the value $ \kappa\sim 1.37$. we also show how finite-$\chi$ scaling allow to extract critical exponents . these results are obtained using the infinite time evolved block decimation algorithm which works in the thermodynamical limit and are verified to agree with density matrix renormalization group results .
