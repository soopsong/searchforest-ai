we report on the first real - time implementation of a quantum key distribution ( qkd ) system using entangled photon pairs that are sent over two free - space optical telescope links . the entangled photon pairs are produced with a type - ii spontaneous parametric down - conversion source placed in a central , potentially untrusted , location . the two free - space links cover a distance of 435 m and 1,325 m respectively , producing a total separation of 1,575 m. the system relies on passive polarization analysis units , gps timing receivers for synchronization , and custom written software to perform the complete qkd protocol including error correction and privacy amplification . over 6.5 hours during the night , we observed an average raw key generation rate of 565 bits / s , an average quantum bit error rate ( qber ) of 4.92 % , and an average secure key generation rate of 85 bits / s .
