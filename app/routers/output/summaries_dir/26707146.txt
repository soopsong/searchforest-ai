it is well established that unpolarized light is invariant with respect to any su(2 ) polarization transformation . this requirement fully characterizes the set of density matrices representing unpolarized states . we introduce the degree of polarization of a quantum state as its distance to the set of unpolarized states . we use two different candidates of distance , namely the hilbert - schmidt and the bures metric , showing that they induce fundamentally different degrees of polarization . we apply these notions to relevant field states and we demonstrate that they avoid some of the problems arising with the classical definition .
