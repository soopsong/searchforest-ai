we propose and develop a new procedure , whereby a quantum system can learn to anneal to a desired ground state . we demonstrate successful learning to produce an entangled state for a two - qubit system , then demonstrate generalizability to larger systems . the amount of additional learning necessary decreases as the size of the system increases . because current technologies limit measurement of the states of quantum annealing machines to determination of the average spin at each site , we then construct a"broken pathway"between the initial and desired states , at each step of which the average spins are nonzero , and show successful learning of that pathway . using this technique we show we can direct annealing to multiqubit ghz and w states , and verify that we have done so . because quantum neural networks are robust to noise and decoherence we expect our method to be readily implemented experimentally ; we show some preliminary results which support this .
