we present a theoretical analysis of the ability of atomic magnetometers to estimate a fluctuating magnetic field . our analysis makes use of a gaussian state description of the atoms and the probing field , and it presents the estimator of the field and a measure of its uncertainty which coincides in the appropriate limit with the achievements for a static field . we show by simulations that the estimator for the current value of the field systematically lags behind the actual value of the field , and we suggest a more complete theory , where measurement results at any time are used to update and improve both the estimate of the current value and the estimate of past values of the b - field .
