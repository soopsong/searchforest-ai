the quantum smoothing theory [ tsang , phys . rev . lett . 102 , 250403 ( 2009 ) ; phys . rev . a , in press ( e - print arxiv:0906.4133 ) ] is extended to account for discrete jumps in the classical random process to be estimated , discrete variables in the quantum system , such as spin , angular momentum , and photon number , and poissonian measurements , such as photon counting . the extended theory is used to model atomic magnetometers and study hardy 's paradox in phase space . in the phase - space picture of hardy 's proposed experiment , the negativity of the predictive wigner distribution is identified as the culprit of the disagreement between classical reasoning and quantum mechanics .
