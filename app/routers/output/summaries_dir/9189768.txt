we challenge the misconception that bloch - redfield equations are a less powerful tool than phenomenological lindblad equations for modeling exciton transport in photosynthetic complexes . this view predominantly originates from an indiscriminate use of the secular approximation . we provide a detailed description of how to model both coherent oscillations and several types of noise , giving explicit examples . all issues with non - positivity are overcome by a consistent straightforward physical noise model . herein also lies the strength of the bloch - redfield approach because it facilitates the analysis of noise - effects by linking them back to physical parameters of the noise environment . this includes temporal and spatial correlations and the strength and type of interaction between the noise and the system of interest . finally we analyze a prototypical dimer system as well as a 7-site fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex in regards to spatial correlation length of the noise , noise strength , temperature and their connection to the transfer time and transfer .
