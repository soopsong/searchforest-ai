coherence is the most fundamental quantum feature in quantum mechanics . for a bipartite quantum state , if a measurement is performed on one party , the other party , based on the measurement outcomes , will collapse to a corresponding state with some probability and hence gain the average coherence . it is shown that the average coherence is not less than the coherence of its reduced density matrix . in particular , it is very surprising that the extra average coherence ( and the maximal extra average coherence with all the possible measurements taken into account ) is upper bounded by the classical correlation of the bipartite state instead of the quantum correlation . we also find the sufficient and necessary condition for the null maximal extra average coherence . some examples demonstrate the relation and , moreover , show that quantum correlation is neither sufficient nor necessary for the nonzero extra average coherence within a given measurement . in addition , the similar conclusions are drawn for both the basis - dependent and the basis - free coherence measure .
