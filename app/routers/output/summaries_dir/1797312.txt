extended clifford circuits straddle the boundary between classical and quantum computational power . whether such circuits are efficiently classically simulable seems to depend delicately on the ingredients of the circuits . while some combinations of ingredients lead to efficiently classically simulable circuits , other combinations , which might just be slightly different , lead to circuits which are likely not . we extend the results of jozsa and van den nest [ quant . info . comput . 14 , 633 ( 2014 ) ] by studying two further extensions of clifford circuits . first , we consider how the classical simulation complexity changes when we allow for more general measurements . second , we investigate different notions of what it means to"classically simulate"a quantum circuit . these further extensions give us 24 new combinations of ingredients compared to jozsa and van den nest , and we give a complete classification of their classical simulation complexities . our results provide more examples where seemingly modest changes to the ingredients of clifford circuits lead to"large"changes in the classical simulation complexities of the circuits , and also include new examples of extended clifford circuits that exhibit"quantum supremacy " , in the sense that it is not possible to efficiently classically sample from the output distributions of such circuits , unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses .
