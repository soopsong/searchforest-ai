characterizing the distribution of entanglement in multipartite systems is one of the most interesting topics on entanglement theory . here we consider a multi - linear monogamy relation for a three - qubit system in terms of entanglement of formation ( eof ) and concurrence . and under our conjecture , we can generalize the results to an n - qubit pure state . at last , we present a trade - off relation between all pairs of a three - qubit pure state in terms of quantum discord .
