we present rigorous and intuitive master equation models to study on - demand single photon sources from pulse - excited quantum dots coupled to cavities . we consider three methods of source excitation : resonant pi - pulse , off - resonant phonon - assisted inversion , and two - photon excitation of a biexciton - exciton cascade , and investigate the effect of the pulse excitation process on the quantum indistinguishability , efficiency , and purity of emitted photons . by explicitly modelling the time - dependent pulsed excitation process in a manner which captures non - markovian effects associated with coupling to photon and phonon reservoirs , we find that photons of near - unity indistinguishability can be emitted with over 90 % efficiency for all these schemes , with the off - resonant schemes not necessarily requiring polarization filtering due to the frequency separation of the excitation pulse , and allowing for very high single photon purities . furthermore , the off - resonant methods are shown to be robust over certain parameter regimes , with less stringent requirements on the excitation pulse duration in particular . we also derive a semi - analytical simplification of our master equation for the off - resonant drive , which gives insight into the important role that exciton - phonon decoupling for a strong drive plays in the off - resonant phonon - assisted inversion process
