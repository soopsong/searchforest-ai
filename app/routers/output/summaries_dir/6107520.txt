the inherently nonlinear interaction between light and motion in cavity optomechanical systems has experimentally been studied in a linearized description in all except highly driven cases . here we demonstrate a nanoscale optomechanical system , in which the interaction between light and motion is so large ( single - photon cooperativity $ c_0 \approx 10 ^ 3 $ ) that thermal motion induces optical frequency fluctuations larger than the intrinsic optical linewidth . the system thereby operates in a fully nonlinear regime , which pronouncedly impacts the optical response , displacement measurement , and radiation pressure backaction . experiments show that the apparent optical linewidth is dominated by thermomechanically - induced frequency fluctuations over a wide temperature range . the nonlinearity induces breakdown of the traditional cavity optomechanical descriptions of thermal displacement measurements . moreover , we explore how radiation pressure backaction in this regime affects the mechanical fluctuation spectra . the strong nonlinearity could serve as a resource to control the motional state of the resonator . we demonstrate the use of highly nonlinear transduction to perform a quadratic measurement of position while suppressing linear transduction .
