we apply the method of moments to prove a recent conjecture of haikin , zamir and gavish ( 2017 ) concerning the distribution of the singular values of random subensembles of paley equiangular tight frames . our analysis applies more generally to real equiangular tight frames of redundancy 2 , and we suspect similar ideas will eventually produce more general results for arbitrary choices of redundancy .
