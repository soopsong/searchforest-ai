estimating the expectation value of an observable is a fundamental task in quantum computation . unfortunately , it is often impossible to obtain such estimates directly , as the computer is restricted to measuring in a fixed computational basis . one common solution splits the observable into a weighted sum of pauli operators and measures each separately , at the cost of many measurements . an improved version first groups mutually commuting pauli operators together and then measures all operators within each group simultaneously . the effectiveness of this depends on two factors . first , to enable simultaneous measurement , circuits are required to rotate each group to the computational basis . in our work , we present two efficient circuit constructions that suitably rotate any group of $ k$ commuting $ n$-qubit pauli operators using at most $ kn - k(k+1)/2 $ and $ o(kn/\log k)$ two - qubit gates respectively . second , metrics that justifiably measure the effectiveness of a grouping are required . in our work , we propose two natural metrics that operate under the assumption that measurements are distributed optimally among groups . motivated by our new metrics , we introduce sorted insertion , a grouping strategy that is explicitly aware of the weighting of each pauli operator in the observable . our methods are numerically illustrated in the context of the variational quantum eigensolver , where the observables in question are molecular hamiltonians . as measured by our metrics , sorted insertion outperforms four conventional greedy colouring algorithms that seek the minimum number of groups .
