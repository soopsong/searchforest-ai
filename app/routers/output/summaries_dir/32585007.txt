we report a coherence - preserving photon frequency down - conversion experiment based on difference - frequency generation in a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide , at the single - photon level . the coherence of the process has been demonstrated by measuring the phase coherence of pseudo single - photon time - bin qubits after frequency conversion with an interference visibility of>96 % . this interface could be of interest for quantum repeater based hybrid networks .
