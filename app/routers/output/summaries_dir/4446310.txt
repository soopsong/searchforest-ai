current experiments are taking the first steps toward noise - resilient logical qubits . crucially , a quantum computer must not merely store information , but also process it . a fault - tolerant computational procedure ensures that errors do not multiply and spread . this review compares the leading proposals for promoting a quantum memory to a quantum processor . we compare magic state distillation , color code techniques and other alternative ideas , paying attention to relative resource demands . we discuss the several no - go results which hold for low - dimensional topological codes and outline the potential rewards of using high - dimensional quantum ( ldpc ) codes in modular architectures .
