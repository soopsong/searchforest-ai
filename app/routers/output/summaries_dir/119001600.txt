properties of the max- relative entropy of entanglement are investigated , and its significance as an upper bound to the one shot rate for perfect entanglement dilution , under a particular class of quantum operations , is discussed . it is shown that it is in fact equal to another known entanglement monotone , namely the log robustness . it is known that the latter is not asymptotically continuous and it is not known whether it is weakly additive . however , by suitably modifying the max- relative entropy of entanglement we obtain a quantity which is seen to satisfy both these properties . in fact , the modified quantity is shown to be equal to the regularised relative entropy of entanglement .
