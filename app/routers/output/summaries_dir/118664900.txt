maximum likelihood quantum state tomography yields estimators that are consistent , provided that the likelihood model is correct , but the maximum likelihood estimators may have bias for any finite data set . the bias of an estimator is the difference between the expected value of the estimate and the true value of the parameter being estimated . this paper investigates bias in the widely used maximum likelihood quantum state tomography . our goal is to understand how the amount of bias depends on factors such as the purity of the true state , the number of measurements performed , and the number of different bases in which the system is measured . for that , we perform numerical experiments that simulate optical homodyne tomography under various conditions , perform tomography , and estimate bias in the purity of the estimated state . we find that estimates of higher purity states exhibit considerable bias , such that the estimates have lower purity than the true states .
