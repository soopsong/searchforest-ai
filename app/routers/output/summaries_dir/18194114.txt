in this paper we study the tailoring of photon spectral properties generated by four - wave mixing in a birefringent photonic crystal fibre ( pcf ) . the aim is to produce intrinsically narrow - band photons and hence to achieve high non - classical interference visibility and generate high fidelity entanglement without any requirement for spectral filtering , leading to high effective detection efficiencies . we show unfiltered hong - ou - mandel interference visibilities of 77 % between photons from the same pcf , and 80 % between separate sources . we compare results from modelling the pcf to these experiments and analyse photon purities .
