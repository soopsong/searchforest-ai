we investigate entanglement of a quantum field in de sitter spacetime using a particle detector model . by considering the entanglement between two comoving detectors interacting with a scalar field , it is possible to detect the entanglement of the scalar field by swapping it to detectors . for the massless minimal scalar field , we find that the entanglement between the detectors can not be detected when their physical separation exceeds the hubble horizon scale . this behavior supports the appearance of the classical nature of quantum fluctuations generated during the inflationary era .
