although slow light ( electromagnetically induced transparency ) would seem an ideal medium in which to institute a ` ` dumb hole ' ' ( black hole analog ) , it suffers from a number of problems . we show that the high phase velocity in the slow light regime ensures that the system can not be used as an analog displaying hawking radiation . even though an appropriately designed slow - light set - up may simulate classical features of black holes -- such as horizon , mode mixing , bogoliubov coefficients , etc . -- it does not reproduce the related quantum effects . pacs : 04.70.dy , 04.80.-y , 42.50.gy , 04.60.-m .
