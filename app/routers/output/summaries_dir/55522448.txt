non - classical interference of photons lies at the heart of optical quantum information processing . this effect is exploited in universal quantum gates as well as in purpose - built quantum computers that solve the bosonsampling problem . although non - classical interference is often associated with perfectly indistinguishable photons this only represents the degenerate case , hard to achieve under realistic experimental conditions . here we exploit tunable distinguishability to reveal the full spectrum of multi - photon non - classical interference . this we investigate in theory and experiment by controlling the delay times of three photons injected into an integrated interferometric network . we derive the entire coincidence landscape and identify transition matrix immanants as ideally suited functions to describe the generalized case of input photons with arbitrary distinguishability . we introduce a compact description by utilizing a natural basis which decouples the input state from the interferometric network , thereby providing a useful tool for even larger photon numbers .
