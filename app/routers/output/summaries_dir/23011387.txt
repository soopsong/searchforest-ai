entanglement r\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropy is an entanglement measure . it generalizes the entanglement of formation , and they coincide when $ \alpha$ tends to 1 . we derive analytical lower and upper bounds for the entanglement r\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropy of arbitrary dimensional bipartite quantum systems . we also demonstrate the application our bound for some concrete examples . moreover , we establish the relation between entanglement r\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropy and some other entanglement measures .
