we address the problem whether a given set of expectation values is compatible with the first and second moments of the generic spin operators of a system with total spin j. those operators appear as the stokes operator in quantum optics , as well as the total angular momentum operators in the atomic ensemble literature . we link this problem to a particular extension problem for bipartite qubit states ; this problem is closely related to the symmetric extension problem that has recently drawn much attention in different contexts of the quantum information literature . we are able to provide operational , approximate solutions for every large spin numbers , and in fact the solution becomes exact in the limiting case of infinite spin numbers . solutions for low spin numbers are formulated in terms of a hyperplane characterization , similar to entanglement witnesses , that can be efficiently solved with semidefinite programming .
