the security of quantum key distribution relies on the validity of quantum mechanics as a description of nature and on the non - existence of leaky degrees of freedom in the practical implementations . we experimentally demonstrate how , in some implementations , timing information revealed during public discussion between the communicating parties can be used by an eavesdropper to undetectably access a significant portion of the ` ` secret ' ' key .
