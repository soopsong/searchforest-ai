we propose and characterize solid - state photonic structures where light experiences an artificial gauge field . a suitable coupling of the propagation and polarization degrees of freedom introduces a geometrical phase for photons tunneling between adjacent sites of a coupled cavity array . we then discuss the feasibility of observing strong gauge field effects in the optical spectra of realistic systems , including the hofstadter butterfly spectrum .
