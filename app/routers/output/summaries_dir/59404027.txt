the black hole information problem has motivated many proposals for new physics . one idea , known as state - dependence , is that quantum mechanics must be generalized to describe the physics of black holes , and that fixed linear operators do not provide the fundamental description of experiences for infalling observers . instead , such experiences are to be described by operators with an extra dependence on the global quantum state . we show that any implementation of this idea strong enough to remove firewalls from generic states requires massive violations of the born rule . we also demonstrate a sense in which such violations are visible to infalling observers involved in preparing the initial state of the black hole . we emphasize the generality of our results ; no details of any specific proposal for state - dependence are required .
