we extend the ito -to- stratonovich analysis or quantum stochastic differential equations , introduced by gardiner and collett for emission ( creation ) , absorption ( annihilation ) processes , to include scattering ( conservation ) processes . working within the framework of quantum stochastic calculus , we define stratonovich calculus as an algebraic modification of the ito one and give conditions for the existence of stratonovich time - ordered exponentials . we show that conversion formula for the coefficients has a striking resemblance to green 's function formulae from standard perturbation theory . we show that the calculus conveniently describes the markov limit of regular open quantum dynamical systemsin much the same way as in the wong - zakai approximation theorems of classical stochastic analysis . we extend previous limit results to multiple - dimensions with a proof that makes use of diagrammatic conventions .
