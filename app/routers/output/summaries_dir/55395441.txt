satellite - based quantum communication is an invaluable resource for the realization of a quantum network at the global scale . in this regard , the use of satellites well beyond the low earth orbits gives the advantage of long communication time with a ground station . however , high - orbit satellites pose a great technological challenge due to the high diffraction losses of the optical channel , and the experimental investigation of such quantum channels is still lacking . here , we report on the first experimental exchange of single photons from global navigation satellite system at a slant distance of 20000 kilometers , by exploiting the retroreflector array mounted on glonass satellites . we also observed the predicted temporal spread of the reflected pulses due to the geometrical shape of array . finally , we estimated the requirements needed for an active source on a satellite , aiming towards quantum communication from gnss with state - of - the - art technology .
