on the january 22nd 2019 , airbus launched a quantum computing challenge to solve a set of problems relevant for the aircraft life cycle ( https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2019/01/airbus-launches-quantum-computing-challenge-to-transform-the-aircraft-lifecycle.html ) . the challenge consists of a set of 5 problems that ranges from design to deployment of aircraft . this work addresses the 5th problem . the formulation exploits an integer programming framework with a linear objective function and the solution relies on the memcomputing paradigm . it is discussed how to use memcpu$^{\text{tm}}$ software to solve efficiently the proposed problem and assess scaling properties , which turns out to be polynomial for meaningful solutions of the problem at hand . also discussed are possible formulations of the problem utilizing non - linear objective functions , allowing for different optimization schemes implementable in modified memcpu software , potentially useful for field operation purposes .
