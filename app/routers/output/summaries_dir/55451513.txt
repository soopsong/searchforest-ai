quantum collision models ( cms ) provide advantageous case studies for investigating major issues in open quantum systems theory , and especially quantum non - markovianity . after reviewing their general definition and distinctive features , we illustrate the emergence of a cm in a familiar quantum optics scenario . this task is carried out by highlighting the close connection between the well - known input - output formalism and cms . within this quantum optics framework , usual assumptions in the cms ' literature - such as considering a bath of non - interacting yet initially correlated ancillas - have a clear physical origin .
