monogamy relations characterize the distributions of entanglement in multipartite systems . we investigate monogamy relations related to the concurrence c , the entanglement of formation e , negativity nc and tsallis - q entanglement tq . monogamy relations for the $ \alpha$th power of entanglement have been derived , which are tighter than the existing entanglement monogamy relations for some classes of quantum states . detailed examples are presented .
