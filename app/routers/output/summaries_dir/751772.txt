we introduce a simple measure of"classicality"of pure and mixed quantum states as a maximum value of the hilbert - schmidt"scalar products"between the renormalized statistical operators of the state concerned and all displaced thermal states . choosing fock states as the reference set , we introduce the measure of"anticlassicality " . both measures are illustrated for the fock , coherent phase , and generic mixed gaussian states . gaussian states are shown to be the closest to thermal states possessing the same degree of quantum purity . on the contrary , fock states appear to be more close to mixed thermal states than to pure coherent states .
