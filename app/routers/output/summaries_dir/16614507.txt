quantum input - output response analysis is a useful method for modeling the dynamics of complex quantum networks , such as those for communication or quantum control via cascade connections . non - markovian effects have not yet been studied in such networks . here we extend the markovian input - output network formalism developed in optical systems to non - markovian cascaded networks which can be used , e.g. , to analyze the input - output response of mesoscopic quantum networks . we use this formalism to explore the behavior of superconducting qubit networks , where we examine the effect of finite cavity bandwidths . we also discuss its application to open- and closed - loop control networks , and show how these networks create effective hamiltonians for the controlled system .
