we prove new upper bounds on the tolerable level of noise in a quantum circuit . we consider circuits consisting of unitary k - qubit gates each of whose input wires is subject to depolarizing noise of strength p , as well as arbitrary one - qubit gates that are essentially noise - free . we assume that the output of the circuit is the result of measuring some designated qubit in the final state . our main result is that for p>1-\theta(1/\sqrt{k } ) , the output of any such circuit of large enough depth is essentially independent of its input , thereby making the circuit useless . for the important special case of k=2 , our bound is p>35.7 % . moreover , if the only allowed gate on more than one qubit is the two - qubit cnot gate , then our bound becomes 29.3 % . these bounds on p are notably better than previous bounds , yet are incomparable because of the somewhat different circuit model that we are using . our main technique is the use of a pauli basis decomposition , which we believe should lead to further progress in deriving such bounds .
