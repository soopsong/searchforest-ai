we discuss how quantum computation can be applied to financial problems , providing an overview of current approaches and potential prospects . we review quantum optimization algorithms , and expose how quantum annealers can be used to optimize portfolios , find arbitrage opportunities , and perform credit scoring . we also discuss deep - learning in finance , and suggestions to improve these methods through quantum machine learning . finally , we consider quantum amplitude estimation , and how it can result in a quantum speed - up for monte carlo sampling . this has direct applications to many current financial methods , including pricing of derivatives and risk analysis . perspectives are also discussed .
