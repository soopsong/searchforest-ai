the entanglement negativity is a versatile measure of entanglement that has numerous applications in quantum information and in condensed matter theory . it can not only efficiently be computed in the hilbert space dimension , but for non - interacting bosonic systems , one can compute the negativity efficiently in the number of modes . however , such an efficient computation does not carry over to the fermionic realm , the ultimate reason for this being that the partial transpose of a fermionic gaussian state is no longer gaussian . to provide a remedy for this state of affairs , in this work we introduce efficiently computable and rigorous upper and lower bounds to the negativity , making use of techniques of semi - definite programming , building upon the lagrangian formulation of fermionic linear optics , and exploiting suitable products of gaussian operators . we discuss examples in quantum many - body theory and hint at applications in the study of topological properties at finite temperature .
