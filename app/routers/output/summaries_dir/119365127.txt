we analyze the probability distributions of the quantum walks induced from markov chains by szegedy ( 2004 ) . the first part of this paper is devoted to the quantum walks induced from finite state markov chains . it is shown that the probability distribution on the states of the underlying markov chain is always convergent in the cesaro sense . in particular , we deduce that the limiting distribution is uniform if the transition matrix is symmetric . in the cases of non - symmetric markov chain , we exemplify that the limiting distribution of the quantum walk is not necessarily identical with the stationary distribution of the underlying irreducible markov chain . the szegedy scheme can be extended to infinite state markov chains ( random walks ) . in the second part , we formulate the quantum walk induced from a lazy random walk on the line . we then obtain the weak limit of the quantum walk . it is noted that the current quantum walk appears to spread faster than its counterpart - quantum walk on the line driven by the grover coin discussed in literature . the paper closes with an outlook on possible future directions .
