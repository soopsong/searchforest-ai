this paper surveys some recent results on the theory of quantum linear systems and presents them within a unified framework . quantum linear systems are a class of systems whose dynamics , which are described by the laws of quantum mechanics , take the specific form of a set of linear quantum stochastic differential equations ( qsdes ) . such systems commonly arise in the area of quantum optics and related disciplines . systems whose dynamics can be described or approximated by linear qsdes include interconnections of optical cavities , beam - spitters , phase - shifters , optical parametric amplifiers , optical squeezers , and cavity quantum electrodynamic systems . with advances in quantum technology , the feedback control of such quantum systems is generating new challenges in the field of control theory . potential applications of such quantum feedback control systems include quantum computing , quantum error correction , quantum communications , gravity wave detection , metrology , atom lasers , and superconducting quantum circuits . a recently emerging approach to the feedback control of quantum linear systems involves the use of a controller which itself is a quantum linear system . this approach to quantum feedback control , referred to as coherent quantum feedback control , has the advantage that it does not destroy quantum information , is fast , and has the potential for efficient implementation . this paper discusses recent results concerning the synthesis of h - infinity optimal controllers for linear quantum systems in the coherent control case . an important issue which arises both in the modelling of linear quantum systems and in the synthesis of linear coherent quantum controllers is the issue of physical realizability . this issue relates to the property of whether a given set of qsdes corresponds to a physical quantum system satisfying the laws of quantum mechanics .
