a hydrodynamic approach is used to calculate an asymptotics of the emptiness formation probability - the probability of a formation of an empty space in the ground state of a quantum one - dimensional many body system . quantum hydrodynamics of a system is represented as a euclidian path integral over configurations of hydrodynamic variables . in the limit of a large size of the empty space , the probability is dominated by an instanton configuration , and the problem is reduced to the finding of an instanton solution of classical hydrodynamic equations . after establishing a general formalism , we carry out this calculation for several simple systems -- free fermions with an arbitrary dispersion and calogero - sutherland model . for these systems we confirm the obtained results by comparison with exact results known in random matrix theory . we argue that the nonlinear hydrodynamic approach might be useful even in cases where the linearized hydrodynamics fails .
