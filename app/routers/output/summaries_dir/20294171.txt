we describe the construction of an apparatus designed to realize a hybrid quantum system comprised of a cryogenically cooled mechanical oscillator and ultra - cold $ ^{87}$rb atoms coupled via light . the outstanding feature of our instrument is an in - situ adjustable asymmetric all - fiber membrane - in - the - middle cavity located inside an ultra - high vacuum dilution refrigerator based cryostat . we show that bose - einstein condensates of $ n=2\times10 ^ 6 $ atoms can be produced in less than 20 s and demonstrate a single photon optomechanical coupling strength of $ g_0=2\pi\times9 $ khz employing a high - stress si$_3$n$_4 $ membrane with a mechanical quality factor $ q_{\rm m}>10 ^ 7 $ at a cavity set - up temperature of $ t_{\rm mim}=480 $ mk .
