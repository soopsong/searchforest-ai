upper bounds on the secret - key - agreement capacity of a quantum channel serve as a way to assess the performance of practical quantum - key - distribution protocols conducted over that channel . in particular , if a protocol employs a quantum repeater , achieving secret - key rates exceeding these upper bounds is a witness to having a working quantum repeater . in this paper , we extend a recent advance [ liuzzo - scorpo et al . , arxiv:1705.03017 ] in the theory of the teleportation simulation of single - mode phase - insensitive gaussian channels such that it now applies to the relative entropy of entanglement measure . as a consequence of this extension , we find tighter upper bounds on the non - asymptotic secret - key - agreement capacity of the lossy thermal bosonic channel than were previously known . the lossy thermal bosonic channel serves as a more realistic model of communication than the pure - loss bosonic channel , because it can model the effects of eavesdropper tampering and imperfect detectors . an implication of our result is that the previously known upper bounds on the secret - key - agreement capacity of the thermal channel are too pessimistic for the practical finite - size regime in which the channel is used a finite number of times , and so it should now be somewhat easier to witness a working quantum repeater when using secret - key - agreement capacity upper bounds as a benchmark .
