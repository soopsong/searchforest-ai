in the present paper , the trace distance is exposed within the quantum operations formalism . the definition of the trace distance in terms of a maximum over all quantum operations is given . it is shown that for any pair of different states , there are an uncountably infinite number of maximizing quantum operations . conversely , for any operation of the described type , there are an uncountably infinite number of those pairs of states that the maximum is reached by the operation . a behavior of the trace distance under considered operations is studied . relations and distinctions between the trace distance and the sine distance are discussed .
