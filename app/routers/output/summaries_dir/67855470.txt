this paper is concerned with the original risk - sensitive performance criterion for quantum stochastic systems and its recent quadratic - exponential counterpart . these functionals are of different structure because of the noncommutativity of quantum variables and have their own useful features such as tractability of evolution equations and robustness properties . we discuss a lie algebraic connection between these two classes of cost functionals for open quantum harmonic oscillators using an apparatus of complex hamiltonian kernels and symplectic factorizations . these results are aimed to extend useful properties from one of the classes of risk - sensitive costs to the other and develop state - space equations for computation and optimization of these criteria in quantum robust control and filtering problems .
