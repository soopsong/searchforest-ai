thermalization is one of the most important phenomena in statistical physics . often , the transition probabilities between different states in the phase space is or can be approximated by constants . in this case , the system can be described by markovian transition kernels , and when the phase space is discrete , by markov chains . in this paper , we introduce a macroscopic entropy on the states of paths of length $ k$ and , studying the recursion relation , obtain a fixed point entropy . this analysis leads to a centrality approach to markov chains entropy .
