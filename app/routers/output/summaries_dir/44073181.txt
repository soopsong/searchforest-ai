markov chains have been widely employed as a fundamental model in the studies of probabilistic and stochastic communicating and concurrent systems . it is well - understood that decomposition techniques play a key role in reachability analysis and model - checking of markov chains . ( discrete - time ) quantum markov chains have been introduced as a model of quantum communicating systems [ 1 ] and also a semantic model of quantum programs [ 2 ] . the bscc ( bottom strongly connected component ) and stationary coherence decompositions of quantum markov chains were introduced in [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] . this paper presents a new decomposition technique , namely periodic decomposition , for quantum markov chains . we further establish a limit theorem for them . as an application , an algorithm to find a maximum dimensional noiseless subsystem of a quantum communicating system is given using decomposition techniques of quantum markov chains .
