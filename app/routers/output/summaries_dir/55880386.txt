in the absence of a reference frame for transformations associated with a group g , any quantum state that is non - invariant under the action of g may serve as a token of the missing reference frame . we here introduce a novel measure of the quality of such a token : the relative entropy of frameness . this is defined as the relative entropy distance between the state of interest and the nearest g - invariant state . unlike the relative entropy of entanglement , this quantity is straightforward to calculate and we find it to be precisely equal to the g - asymmetry , a measure of frameness introduced by vaccaro et al . it is shown to provide an upper bound on the mutual information between the group element encoded into the token and the group element that may be extracted from it by measurement . in this sense , it quantifies the extent to which the token successfully simulates a full reference frame . we also show , that despite a suggestive analogy from entanglement theory , the regularized relative entropy of frameness is zero and therefore does not quantify the rate of interconversion between the token and some standard form of quantum reference frame . finally , we show how these investigations yield a novel approach to bounding the relative entropy of entanglement .
