mechanical oscillators which respond to radiation pressure are a promising means of transferring quantum information between light and matter . optical -- mechanical state swaps are a key operation in this setting . existing proposals for optomechanical state swap interfaces are only effective in the resolved sideband limit . here , we show that it is possible to fully and deterministically exchange mechanical and optical states outside of this limit , in the common case that the cavity linewidth is larger than the mechanical resonance frequency . this high - bandwidth interface opens up a significantly larger region of optomechanical parameter space , allowing generation of non - classical motional states of high - quality , low - frequency mechanical oscillators .
