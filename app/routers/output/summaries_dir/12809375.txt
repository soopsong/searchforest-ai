the dynamics of a geometric measure of the quantum discord ( gmqd ) under decoherence is investigated . we show that the gmqd of a two - qubit state can be alternatively obtained through the singular values of a $ 3\times4 $ matrix whose elements are the expectation values of pauli matrices of the two qubits . by using heisenberg picture , the analytic results of the gmqd is obtained for three typical kinds of the quantum decoherence channels . we compare the dynamics of the gmqd with that of the quantum discord and of entanglement . we show that a sudden change in the decay rate of the gmqd does not always imply that of the quantum discord , and vice versa . we also give a general analysis on the sudden change in behavior and find that at least for the bell diagonal states , the sudden changes in decay rates of the gmqd and that of the quantum discord occur simultaneously .
