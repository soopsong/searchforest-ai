two very similar proposals have been made recently for witnessing nonclassical features of gravity , by bose et al . and by marletto and vedral . however , while these proposals are asserted to be very general , they are in fact based on a very strong claim : that quantum systems can not become entangled via a classical intermediary . we point out that the support provided for this claim is only applicable to a very limited class of quantum - classical interaction models , corresponding to koopman - type dynamics . we show that the claim is also valid for mean - field models , but that it is contradicted by explicit counterexamples based on the configuration - ensemble model . thus , neither proposal provides a definitive test of nonclassical gravity .
