nanoscale photonic crystal cavity optomechanical devices enable detection of nanomechanical phenomena with a sensitivity sufficient to observe quantum effects . here we present the design of a one - dimensional air - mode photonic crystal cavity patterned in a silicon nitride nanobeam , and show that it forms the basis for cavity optomechanical split - beam and paddle nanocavity devices useful for force detection and nonlinear quantum sensing . the air - mode of this device is advantageous for optomechanical coupling , while also having ultrahigh optical quality factor $ q_o\sim 10 ^ 6 $ despite its proximity to the light - line and the relatively low refractive index of silicon nitride . paddle nanocavities realized from this device have a quadratic coupling coefficient $ g^{(2)}/2\pi$~=~10~mhz / nm$^{2}$ , and their performance within the context of quantum optomechanics experiments is analyzed .
