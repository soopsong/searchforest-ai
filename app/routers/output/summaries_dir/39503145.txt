we describe an entanglement purification protocol ( epp ) for atomic entangled pair using photonic faraday rotation . it is shown that after the two single photons input - output process in cavity qed , the high quality entangled atomic state can be obtained from the low quality mixed entangled atomic states . different from other epps , the two pairs of mixed states do not need to intact directly . as the photonic faraday rotation works on the low - q cavities , this epp is useful in both quantum communication and computation .
