for a general class of gaussian processes $ w$ , indexed by a sigma - algebra $ \mathscr f$ of a general measure space $ ( m,\mathscr f , \sigma)$ , we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of a quadratic variation representation for such gaussian processes , thus recovering $ \sigma(a)$ , for $ a\in\mathscr f$ , as a quadratic variation of $ w$ over $ a$. we further provide a harmonic analysis representation for this general class of processes . we apply these two results to : $ ( i)$ a computation of generalized ito - integrals ; and $ ( ii)$ a proof of an explicit , and measure - theoretic equivalence formula , realizing an equivalence between the two approaches to gaussian processes , one where the choice of sample space is the traditional path - space , and the other where it is schwartz ' space of tempered distributions .
