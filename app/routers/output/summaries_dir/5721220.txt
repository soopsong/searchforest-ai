this paper proposes a robust control method based on sliding mode design for two - level quantum systems with bounded uncertainties . an eigenstate of the two - level quantum system is identified as a sliding mode . the objective is to design a control law to steer the system 's state into the sliding mode domain and then maintain it in that domain when bounded uncertainties exist in the system hamiltonian . we propose a controller design method using the lyapunov methodology and periodic projective measurements . in particular , we give conditions for designing such a control law , which can guarantee the desired robustness in the presence of the uncertainties . the sliding mode control method has potential applications to quantum information processing with uncertainties .
