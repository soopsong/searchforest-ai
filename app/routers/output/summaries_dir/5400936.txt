the pressure of fundamental limits on classical computation and the promise of exponential speedups from quantum effects have recently brought quantum circuits to the attention of the eda community [ 10 , 17 , 4 , 16 , 9 ] . we discuss efficient circuits to initialize quantum registers and implement generic quantum computations . our techniques yield circuits that are twice as small as the best previously published technique . moreover , a theoretical lower bound shows that our new circuits can be improved by at most a factor of two . further , the circuits grow by at most a factor of nine under severe architectural restrictions .
