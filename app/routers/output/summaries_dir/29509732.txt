in the majority of optomechanical experiments , the interaction between light and mechanical motion is mediated by radiation pressure , which arises from momentum transfer of reflecting photons . this is an inherently weak interaction , and optically generated carriers in semiconductors have been predicted to be the mediator of different and potentially much stronger forces . here we demonstrate optomechanical forces induced by electron - hole pairs in coupled quantum wells embedded into a free - free nanomembrane . we identify contributions from the deformation - potential and piezoelectric coupling and observe optically driven motion about three orders of magnitude larger than expected from radiation pressure . the amplitude and phase of the driven oscillations are controlled by an applied electric field , which tunes the carrier lifetime to match the mechanical period . our work opens perspectives for not only enhancing the optomechanical interaction in a range of experiments , but also for interfacing mechanical objects with complex macroscopic quantum objects , such as excitonic condensates .
