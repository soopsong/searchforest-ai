we give a new interpretation of the effect of initial state entanglement on the spectrum of vacuum fluctuations . we consider an initially entangled state between two free massive scalar fields in de sitter space . we construct the initial state by making use of a bogoliubov transformation between the bunch - davies vacuum and a four mode squeezed state , and then derive the exact power spectrum for one of the scalar fields . we demonstrate that an oscillatory spectrum hardly appears for the initially entangled state unless an ad hoc absolute value of the bogoliubov coefficients is chosen .
