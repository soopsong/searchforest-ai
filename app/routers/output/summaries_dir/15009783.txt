since its inception about two centuries ago thermodynamics has sparkled continuous interest and fundamental questions . according to the second law no heat engine can have an efficiency larger than carnot 's efficiency . the latter can be achieved by the carnot engine , which however ideally operates in infinite time , hence delivers null power . a currently open question is whether the carnot efficiency can be achieved at finite power . most of the previous works addressed this question within the onsager matrix formalism of linear response theory . here we pursue a different route based on finite - size - scaling theory . we focus on quantum otto engines and show that when the working substance is at the verge of a second order phase transition diverging energy fluctuations can enable approaching the carnot point without sacrificing power . the rate of such approach is dictated by the critical indices , thus showing the universal character of our analysis .
