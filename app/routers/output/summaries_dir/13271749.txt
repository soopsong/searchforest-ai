we experimentally perform the simulation of open quantum dynamics in single - qudit systems . using a spatial light modulator as a dissipative optical device , we implement dissipative - dynamical maps onto qudits encoded in the transverse momentum of spontaneous parametric down - converted photon pairs . we show a well - controlled technique to prepare entangled qudits states as well as to implement dissipative local measurements ; the latter realize two specific dynamics : dephasing and amplitude damping . our work represents a new analogy - dynamical experiment for simulating an open quantum system .
