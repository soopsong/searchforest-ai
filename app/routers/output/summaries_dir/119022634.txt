we introduce the notion of holographic non - computer as a system which exhibits parametrically large delays in the growth of complexity , as calculated within the complexity - action proposal . some known examples of this behavior include extremal black holes and near - extremal hyperbolic black holes . generic black holes in higher - dimensional gravity also show non - computing features . within the $ 1 / d$ expansion of general relativity , we show that large-$d$ scalings which capture the qualitative features of complexity , such as a linear growth regime and a plateau at exponentially long times , also exhibit an initial computational delay proportional to $ d$. while consistent for large ads black holes , the required ` non - computing ' scalings are incompatible with thermodynamic stability for schwarzschild black holes , unless they are tightly caged .
