we present new algorithms for mixed - state multi - copy entanglement distillation for pairs of qubits . our algorithms perform significantly better than the best known algorithms . better algorithms can be derived that are tuned for specific initial states . the new algorithms are based on a characterization of the group of all locally realizable permutations of the 4^n possible tensor products of n bell states .
