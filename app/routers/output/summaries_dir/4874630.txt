hidden quantum markov models ( hqmms ) can be thought of as quantum probabilistic graphical models that can model sequential data . we extend previous work on hqmms with three contributions : ( 1 ) we show how classical hidden markov models ( hmms ) can be simulated on a quantum circuit , ( 2 ) we reformulate hqmms by relaxing the constraints for modeling hmms on quantum circuits , and ( 3 ) we present a learning algorithm to estimate the parameters of an hqmm from data . while our algorithm requires further optimization to handle larger datasets , we are able to evaluate our algorithm using several synthetic datasets . we show that on hqmm generated data , our algorithm learns hqmms with the same number of hidden states and predictive accuracy as the true hqmms , while hmms learned with the baum - welch algorithm require more states to match the predictive accuracy .
