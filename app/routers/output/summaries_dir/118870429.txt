we present an approximate analysis of a nonlinear effect of parametric oscillatory instability in fp interferometer . the basis for this effect is the excitation of the additional ( stokes ) optical mode and of the mirror 's elastic mode when the optical energy stored in the fp resonator main mode exceeds the certain threshold . this effect is undesirable in laser gravitational wave antennae because it may create a specific upper limit for the value of energy stored in fp resonator . in order to avoid it the detailed analysis of the mirror 's elastic modes and fp resonator optical modes structure is necessary .
