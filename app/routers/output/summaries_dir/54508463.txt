open quantum walks ( oqw ) are formulated as quantum markov chains on graphs . it is shown that oqws are a very useful tool for the formulation of dissipative quantum computing algorithms and for dissipative quantum state preparation . in particular , single qubit gates and the cnot - gate are implemented as oqws on fully connected graphs . also , dissipative quantum state preparation of arbitrary single qubit states and of all two - qubit bell - states is demonstrated . finally , the discrete time version of dissipative quantum computing is shown to be more efficient if formulated in the language of oqws .
