we consider the problem of evaluating the entanglement of non - gaussian mixed states generated by photon subtraction from entangled squeezed states . the entanglement measures we use are the negativity and the logarithmic negativity . these measures possess the unusual property of being computable with linear algebra packages even for high - dimensional quantum systems . we numerically evaluate these measures for the non - gaussian mixed states which are generated by photon subtraction with on / off photon detectors . the results are compared with the behavior of certain operational measures , namely the teleportation fidelity and the mutual information in the dense coding scheme . it is found that all of these results are mutually consistent , in the sense that whenever the enhancement is seen in terms of the operational measures , the negativity and the logarithmic negativity are also enhanced .
