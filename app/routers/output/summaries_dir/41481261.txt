recently , li et al . [ phys . rev . a 82(2):022303 , 2010 ] presented two semi - quantum secret sharing ( sqss ) protocols using greenberger - horne - zeilinger - like states . the proposed schemes are quite practical because only the secret dealer needs to be equipped with advanced quantum devices such as quantum memory , whereas the other agents can merely perform classical operations to complete the secret sharing . however , the present study demonstrates the existence of a security pitfall in the eavesdropping check phase of both the schemes , which can lead to an intercept - resend attack and a trojan horse attack on the two schemes by a dishonest agent , to determine the other agent â€™s shadow and consequently derive the master key of the sqss . this contradicts the security requirement of qss . fortunately , two possible solutions are proposed herein to eliminate this security pitfall .
