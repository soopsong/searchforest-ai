collective scattering of spatially coherent radiation by separated point emitters induces inter - particle forces . for particles close to nano - photonic structures as , for example , nano - fibers , hollow core fibers or photonic waveguides , this pair - interaction induced by monochromatic light is periodic and virtually of infinite range . here we show that the shape and range of the optical interaction potential can be precisely controlled by spectral design of the incoming illumination . if each particle is only weakly coupled to the confined guided modes the forces acting within a particle ensemble can be decomposed to pairwise interactions . these forces can be tailored to almost arbitrary spatial dependence as they are related to fourier transforms with coefficients controlled by the intensities and frequencies of the illuminating lasers . we demonstrate the versatility of the scheme by highlighting some examples of unconventional pair potentials . implementing these interactions in a chain of trapped quantum particles could be the basis of a versatile quantum simulator with almost arbitrary all - to - all interaction control .
