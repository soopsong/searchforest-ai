we develop and demonstrate a technique to engineer universal unitary baths in quantum systems . using the correspondence between unitary decoherence due to ambient environmental noise and errors in a control system for quantum bits , we show how a wide variety of relevant classical error models may be realized through in - phase / quadrature modulation on a vector signal generator producing a resonant carrier signal . we demonstrate our approach through high - bandwidth modulation of the 12.6 ghz carrier appropriate for trapped $ ^{171}$yb$^{+}$ ions . experiments demonstrate the reduction of coherent lifetime in the system in the presence of an engineered bath , with the observed $ t_{2}$ scaling as predicted by a quantitative model described herein . these techniques form the basis of a toolkit for quantitative tests of quantum control protocols , helping experimentalists characterize the performance of their quantum coherent systems .
