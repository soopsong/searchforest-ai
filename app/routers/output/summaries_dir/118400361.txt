we explore the quantum correlation distribution in multipartite quantum states based on the square of quantum discord ( sqd ) . for tripartite quantum systems , we derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the sqd to satisfy the monogamy relation . particularly , we prove that the sqd is monogamous for three - qubit pure states , based on which a genuine tripartite quantum correlation measure is introduced . in addition , we also address the quantum correlation distributions in four - qubit pure states . as an example , we investigate multipartite quantum correlations in the dynamical evolution of multipartite cavity - reservoir systems .
