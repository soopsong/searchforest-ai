we propose a method to generate quadrature squeezed states of a moving mirror in a fabry - perot cavity . this is achieved by exploiting the fact that when the cavity is driven by an external field with a large detuning , the moving mirror behaves as a parametric oscillator . we show that parametric resonance can be reached approximately by modulating the driving field amplitude at a frequency matching the frequency shift of the mirror . the parametric resonance leads to an efficient generation of squeezing , which is limited by the thermal noise of the environment .
