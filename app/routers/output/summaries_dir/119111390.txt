we study bipartite entanglement in systems of n identical bosons distributed in m different modes . for such systems , a definition of separability not related to any a priori hilbert space tensor product structure is needed and can be given in terms of commuting subalgebras of observables . using this generalized notion of separability , we classify the states for which partial transposition turns out to be a necessary and sufficient condition for entanglement detection .
