we study the time - dependent aharonov - bohm effect on the noncommutative space . because there is no net aharonov - bohm phase shift in the time - dependent case on the commutative space , therefore , a tiny deviation from zero indicates new physics . based on the seiberg - witten map we obtain the gauge invariant and lorentz covariant aharonov - bohm phase shift in general case on noncommutative space . we find there are two kinds of contribution : momentum - dependent and momentum - independent corrections . for the momentum - dependent correction , there is a cancellation between the magnetic and electric phase shifts , just like the case on the commutative space . however , there is a non - trivial contribution in the momentum - independent correction . this is true for both the time - independent and time - dependent aharonov - bohm effects on the noncommutative space . however , for the time - dependent aharonov - bohm effect , there is no overwhelming background which exists in the time - independent aharonov - bohm effect on both commutative and noncommutative space . therefore , the time - dependent aharonov - bohm can be sensitive to the spatial noncommutativity . \draftnote{the net correction is proportional to the product of the magnetic fluxes through the fundamental area represented by the noncommutative parameter $ \theta$ , and through the surface enclosed by the trajectory of charged particle . } more interestingly , there is an anti - collinear relation between the logarithms of the magnetic field $ b$ and the averaged flux $ \phi / n$ ( n is the number of fringes shifted ) . this nontrivial relation can also provide a way to test the spatial noncommutativity . for $ b\phi / n\sim 1 $ , our estimation on the experimental sensitivity shows that it can reach the $ \rm 10gev$ scale . this sensitivity can be enhanced by using stronger magnetic field strength , larger magnetic flux , as well as higher experimental precision on the phase shift .
