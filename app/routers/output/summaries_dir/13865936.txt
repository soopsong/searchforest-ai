we present low - temperature measurements of low - loss superconducting nanowire - embedded resonators in the low - power limit relevant for quantum circuits . the superconducting resonators are embedded with superconducting nanowires with widths down to 20 nm using a neon focused ion beam . in the low - power limit , we demonstrate an internal quality factor up to 3.9x10 ^ 5 at 300mk [ implying a two - level - system - limited quality factor up to 2x10 ^ 5 at 10 mk ] , not only significantly higher than in similar devices but also matching the state of the art of conventional josephson - junction - embedded resonators . we also show a high sensitivity of the nanowire to stray infrared photons , which is controllable by suitable precautions to minimize stray photons in the sample environment . our results suggest that there are excellent prospects for superconducting - nanowire - based quantum circuits .
