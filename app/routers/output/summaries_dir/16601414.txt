topological quantum computing has recently proven itself to be a very powerful model when considering large- scale , fully error corrected quantum architectures . in addition to its robust nature under hardware errors , it is a software driven method of error corrected computation , with the hardware responsible for only creating a generic quantum resource ( the topological lattice ) . computation in this scheme is achieved by the geometric manipulation of holes ( defects ) within the lattice . interactions between logical qubits ( quantum gate operations ) are implemented by using particular arrangements of the defects , such as braids and junctions . we demonstrate that junction - based topological quantum gates allow highly regular and structured implementation of large cnot ( controlled - not ) gate networks , which ultimately form the basis of the error corrected primitives that must be used for an error corrected algorithm . we present a number of heuristics to optimise the area of the resulting structures and therefore the number of the required hardware resources .
