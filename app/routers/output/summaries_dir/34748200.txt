cooling to the motional ground state is an important first step in the preparation of nonclassical states of mesoscopic mechanical oscillators . light - mediated coupling to a remote atomic ensemble has been proposed as a method to reach the ground state for low frequency oscillators . the ground state can also be reached using optical measurement followed by feedback control . here we investigate the possibility of enhanced cooling by combining these two approaches . the combination , in general , outperforms either individual technique , though atomic ensemble - based cooling and feedback cooling each individually dominate over large regions of parameter space .
