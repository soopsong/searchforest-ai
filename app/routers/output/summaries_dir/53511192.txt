while the advanced coherent control of qubits is now routinely carried out in low frequency ( ghz ) systems like single spins , it is far more challenging to achieve for two - level systems in the optical domain . this is because the latter evolve typically in the thz range , calling for tools of ultrafast , coherent , nonlinear optics . using four - wave mixing micro - spectroscopy , we here measure the optically driven dynamics of a single exciton quantum state confined in a semiconductor quantum dot . in a combined experimental and theoretical approach , we reveal the intrinsic rabi oscillation dynamics by monitoring both central exciton quantities , i.e. , its occupation and the microscopic coherence , as resolved by the four - wave mixing technique . in the frequency domain this oscillation generates the autler - townes splitting of the light - exciton dressed states , directly seen in the four - wave mixing spectra . we further demonstrate that the coupling to acoustic phonons strongly influences the fwm dynamics on the picosecond timescale , because it leads to transitions between the dressed states .
