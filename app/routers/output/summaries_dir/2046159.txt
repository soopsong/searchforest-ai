digital signatures play an important role in software distribution , modern communication and financial transactions , where it is important to detect forgery and tampering . signatures are a cryptographic technique for validating the authenticity and integrity of messages , software , or digital documents . the security of currently used classical schemes relies on computational assumptions . quantum digital signatures ( qds ) , on the other hand , provide information - theoretic security based on the laws of quantum physics . recent work on qds shows that such schemes do not require trusted quantum channels and are unconditionally secure against general coherent attacks . however , in practical qds , just as in quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , the detectors can be subjected to side - channel attacks , which can make the actual implementations insecure . motivated by the idea of measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution ( mdi - qkd ) , we present a measurement - device - independent qds ( mdi - qds ) scheme , which is secure against all detector side - channel attacks . based on the rapid development of practical mdi - qkd , our mdi - qds protocol could also be experimentally implemented , since it requires a similar experimental setup .
