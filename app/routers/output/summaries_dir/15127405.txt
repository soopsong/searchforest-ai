recently several quantum search algorithms based on quantum walks were proposed . those algorithms differ from grover 's algorithm in many aspects . the goal is to find a marked vertex in a graph faster than classical algorithms . since the implementation of those new algorithms in quantum computers or in other quantum devices is error - prone , it is important to analyze their robustness under decoherence . in this work we analyze the impact of decoherence on quantum search algorithms implemented on two - dimensional grids and on hypercubes .
