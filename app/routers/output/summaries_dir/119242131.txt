in previous work , we have proposed an entanglement indicator for a general multiqubit state , which can be"learned"by a quantum system , acting as a neural network . the indicator can be used for a pure or a mixed state , and it need not be"close"to any particular state ; moreover , as the size of the system grows , the amount of additional training necessary diminishes . here , we show that the indicator is stable to noise and decoherence .
