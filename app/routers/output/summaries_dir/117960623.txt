this paper studies secure multiparty quantum computation ( smqc ) without nonlocal measurements . firstly , this task is reduced to secure two - party quantum computation of nonlocal controlled - not ( nl - cnot ) gate . then , in the passive adversaries model , the secure computation of nl - cnot is reduced to bit commitment . thus , a smqc scheme can be constructed based on bit commitment . this scheme does not depend on trusted third party , and is secure in the passive adversaries model . it is also pointed out that a vulnerability exists in any secure two - party quantum computation protocol of nl - cnot gate .
