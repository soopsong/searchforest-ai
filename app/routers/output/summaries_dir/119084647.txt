hybrid superconducting -- spin systems offer the potential to combine highly coherent atomic quantum systems with the scalability of superconducting circuits . to fully exploit this potential requires a high quality - factor microwave resonator , tunable in frequency and able to operate at magnetic fields optimal for the spin system . such magnetic fields typically rule out conventional al - based josephson junction devices that have previously been used for tunable high-$q$ microwave resonators . the larger critical field of niobium ( nb ) allows microwave resonators with large field resilience to be fabricated . here , we demonstrate how constriction - type weak links , patterned in parallel into the central conductor of a nb coplanar resonator using a neon focused ion beam ( fib ) , can be used to implement a frequency - tunable resonator . we study transmission through two such devices and show how they realise high quality factor , tunable , field resilient devices which hold promise for future applications coupling to spin systems .
