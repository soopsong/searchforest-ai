we address parameter estimation for complex / structured systems and suggest an effective estimation scheme based on continuous - variables quantum probes . in particular , we investigate the use of a single bosonic mode as a probe for ohmic reservoirs , and obtain the ultimate quantum limits to the precise estimation of their cutoff frequency . we assume the probe prepared in a gaussian state and determine the optimal working regime , i.e. the conditions for the maximization of the quantum fisher information in terms of the initial preparation , the reservoir temperature and the interaction time . upon investigating the fisher information of feasible measurements we arrive at a remarkable simple result : homodyne detection of canonical variables allows one to achieve the ultimate quantum limit to precision under suitable , mild , conditions . finally , upon exploiting a perturbative approach , we find the invariant sweet spots of the ( tunable ) characteristic frequency of the probe , able to drive the probe towards the optimal working regime .
