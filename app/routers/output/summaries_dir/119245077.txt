we study the far - from - equilibrium statistical mechanics of periodically driven fermionic atoms in a lossy optical resonator . we show that the interplay of the fermi surface with cavity losses leads to sub - natural cavity linewidth narrowing , squeezed light , and out - of - equilibrium quantum statistics of the atoms . adapting the keldysh approach , we set - up and solve a quantum kinetic boltzmann equation in a systematic $ 1 / n$ expansion with $ n$ the number of atoms . in the strict thermodynamic limit $ n , v\rightarrow \infty$ , $ n / v=\text{const.}$ we find the atoms ( fermions or bosons ) remain immune against cavity - induced heating or cooling . at next - to - leading order in $ 1 / n$ , we find a"one - way thermalization"of the atoms determined by cavity decay . we argue that , in absence of an equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation , the long - time limit $ \delta t \rightarrow \infty$ does not commute with the thermodynamic limit $ n\rightarrow \infty$ , such that for the physically relevant case of large but finite $ n$ , the dynamics ultimately becomes strongly coupled , especially close to the superradiance phase transition .
