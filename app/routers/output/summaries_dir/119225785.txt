we describe a new paradox for ideal fluids . it arises in the accretion of an \textit{ideal } fluid onto a black hole , where , under suitable boundary conditions , the flow can violate the generalized second law of thermodynamics . the paradox indicates that there is in fact a lower bound to the correlation length of any \textit{real } fluid , the value of which is determined by the thermodynamic properties of that fluid . we observe that the universal bound on entropy , itself suggested by the generalized second law , puts a lower bound on the correlation length of any fluid in terms of its specific entropy . with the help of a new , efficient estimate for the viscosity of liquids , we argue that this also means that viscosity is bounded from below in a way reminiscent of the conjectured kovtun - son - starinets lower bound on the ratio of viscosity to entropy density . we conclude that much light may be shed on the kovtun - son - starinets bound by suitable arguments based on the generalized second law .
