quantum key distribution ( qkd ) is a key exchange protocol which is implemented over free space optical links and optical fiber cable . when direct communication is not possible , qkd is performed over fiber cables , but the imperfections in detectors used at receiver side and also the material properties of fiber cables limit the long distance communication . free space based quantum key distribution is free from such limitations , and can pave way for satellite based quantum communication to set up a global network for sharing secret messages . to implement free space optical ( fso ) links , it is essential to study the effect of atmospheric turbulence . here , an analysis is made for satellite based quantum communication using qkd protocols . the results obtained indicate that sarg04 protocol is an effective approach for satellite based quantum communication .
