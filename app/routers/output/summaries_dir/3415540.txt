this paper addresses a simple question : how small can one make a gravitational source mass and still detect its gravitational coupling to a nearby test mass ? we describe an experimental scheme based on micromechanical sensing to observe gravity between milligram - scale source masses , thereby improving the current smallest source mass values by three orders of magnitude and possibly even more . we also discuss the implications of such measurements both for improved precision measurements of newton 's constant and for a new generation of experiments at the interface between quantum physics and gravity .
