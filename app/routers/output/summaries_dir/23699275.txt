we report two - photon interference with continuous - wave multi - mode coherent light . we show that the two - photon interference , in terms of the detection time difference , reveals two - photon beating fringes with the visibility $ v = 0.5$. while scanning the optical delay of the interferometer , hong - ou - mandel dips or peaks are measured depending on the chosen detection time difference . the hom dips / peaks are repeated when the optical delay and the first - order coherence revival period of the multi - mode coherent light are the same .
