motivated by applications to the study of stochastic processes , we introduce a new analysis of positive definite kernels $ k$ , their reproducing kernel hilbert spaces ( rkhs ) , and an associated family of feature spaces that may be chosen in the form $ l^{2}\left(\mu\right)$ ; and we study the question of which measures $ \mu$ are right for a particular kernel $ k$. the answer to this depends on the particular application at hand . such applications are the focus of the separate sections in the paper .
