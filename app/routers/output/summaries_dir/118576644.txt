we study the hilbert - schmidt measure on the manifold of mixed gaussian states in multi mode continuous variable quantum systems . an analytical expression for the hilbert - schmidt volume element is derived . its corresponding probability measure can be used to study typical properties of gaussian states . it turns out that although the manifold of gaussian states is unbounded , an ensemble of gaussian states distributed according to this measure still has a normalizable distribution of symplectic eigenvalues , from which unitarily invariant properties can be obtained . by contrast , we find that for an ensemble of one - mode gaussian states based on the bures measure the corresponding distribution can not be normalized . as important applications , we determine the distribution and the mean value of von neumann entropy and purity for the hilbert - schmidt measure .
