we present an error analysis of various tomographic protocols based on the linear inversion for the reconstruction of an unknown two - qubit state . we solve the problem of finding a tomographic protocol which is the most robust against errors in terms of the lowest value ( i.e. , equal to 1 ) of a condition number , as required by the gastinel - kahan theorem . in contrast , standard tomographic protocols , including those based on mutually unbiased bases , are nonoptimal for determining all 16 elements of an unknown two - qubit density matrix . our method is based on the measurements of the 16 generalized pauli operators , where twelve of them can be locally measured , and the other four require nonlocal bell measurements . our method corresponds to selectively measuring , one by one , all of the real and imaginary elements of an unknown two - qubit density matrix . we describe two experimentally feasible setups of this protocol for the optimal reconstruction of two photons in an unknown polarization state using conventional detectors and linear - optical elements . moreover , we define the operators for the optimal reconstruction of the states of multiqubit or multilevel ( qudit ) systems .
