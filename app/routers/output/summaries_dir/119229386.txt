the additivity problem asks if the use of entanglement can boost the information - carrying capacity of a given channel beyond what is achievable by coding with simple product states only . this has recently been shown not to be the case for phase - insensitive one - mode gaussian channels , but remains unresolved in general . here we consider two general classes of bosonic noise channels , which include phase - insensitive gaussian channels as special cases : these are beamsplitters with general , potentially non - gaussian environment states and classical noise channels with general probabilistic noise . we show that additivity violations , if existent , are rather minor for all these channels : the maximal gain in classical capacity is bounded by a constant independent of the input energy . our proof shows that coding by simple classical modulation of coherent states is close to optimal .
