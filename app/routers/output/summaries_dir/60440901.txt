quantum theory ( qt ) has been confirmed by numerous experiments , yet we still can not fully grasp the meaning of the theory . as a consequence , the quantum world appears to us paradoxical . here we shed new light on qt by being based on two main postulates : 1 . the theory should be logically consistent ; 2 . inferences in the theory should be computable in polynomial time . the first postulate is what we require to each well - founded mathematical theory . the computation postulate defines the physical component of the theory . we show that the computation postulate is the only true divide between qt , seen as a generalised theory of probability , and classical probability . all quantum paradoxes , and entanglement in particular , arise from the clash of trying to reconcile a computationally intractable , somewhat idealised , theory ( classical physics ) with a computationally tractable theory ( qt ) or , in other words , from regarding physics as fundamental rather than computation .
