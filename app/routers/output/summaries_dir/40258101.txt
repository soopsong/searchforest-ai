we consider exciton - photon coupling in semiconductor microcavities in which separate periodic potentials have been embedded for excitons and photons . we show theoretically that this system supports degenerate ground - states appearing at non - zero in - plane momenta , corresponding to multiple valleys in reciprocal space , which are further separated in polarization corresponding to a polarization - valley coupling in the system . aside forming a basis for valleytronics , the multivalley dispersion is predicted to allow for spontaneous momentum symmetry breaking and two - mode squeezing under non - resonant and resonant excitation , respectively .
