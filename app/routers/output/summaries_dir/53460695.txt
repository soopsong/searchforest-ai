the evolution of high dimensional entanglement in atmospheric turbulence is investigated . we study the effects of turbulence on photonic states generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion , both theoretically and experimentally . one of the photons propagates through turbulence , while the other is left undisturbed . the atmospheric turbulence is simulated by a single phase screen based on the kolmogorov theory of turbulence . the output after turbulence is projected into a three - dimensional ( qutrit ) basis composed of specific laguerre - gaussian modes . a full state tomography is performed to determine the density matrix for each output quantum state . these density matrices are used to determine the amount of entanglement , quantified in terms of the negativity , as a function of the scintillation strength . theoretically , the entanglement is calculated using a single phase screen approximation . we obtain good agreement between theory and experiment .
