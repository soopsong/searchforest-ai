advances in recent years have made it possible to explore quantum dots as a viable technology for scalable quantum information processing . charge qubits for example can be realized in the lowest bound states of coupled quantum dots and the precision control of the confinement potential allows for the realization of a full set of universal qubit gates , including arbitrary single - qubit rotations and two - qubit c - not gates . in this work we describe a novel scheme for implementing quantum random walks on arbitrarily complex graphs by extending these elementary operations to the control of a two - dimensional quantum dot grid . as single - qubit rotations constitute the essential building blocks of our implementation scheme , we also present numerical simulations of one such mechanism by directly solving the corresponding time - dependent schrodinger equation .
