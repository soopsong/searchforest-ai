most modern classical processors support so - called von neumann architecture with program and data registers . in present work is revisited similar approach to models of quantum processors . deterministic programmable quantum gate arrays are considered as an example . they are also called von neumann quantum processors here and use conditional quantum dynamics . such devices have some problems with universality , but consideration of hybrid quantum processors , i.e. , models with both continuous and discrete quantum variables resolves the problems . it is also discussed comparison of such a model of quantum processors with more traditional approach .
