in the present article , the robustness of entanglement in two qubits maximally entangled mixed states ( meme ) have been studied under quantum decoherence channels . here we consider bit flip , phase flip , bit - phase - flip , amplitude damping , phase damping and depolarization channels . to quantify the entanglement , the concurrence has been used as an entanglement measure . during this study interesting results have been found for sudden death and birth of entanglement under bit flip and bit - phase - flip channels . while amplitude damping channel produces entanglement sudden death and does not allow re - birth of entanglement . on the other hand , two qubits mems exhibit the robust character against the phase flip , phase damping and depolarization channels . the elegant behavior of all the quantum channels have been investigated with varying parameter of quantum state mems in different cases .
