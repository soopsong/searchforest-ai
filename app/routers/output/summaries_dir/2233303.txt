quantum control is valuable for various quantum technologies such as high - fidelity gates for universal quantum computing , adaptive quantum - enhanced metrology , and ultra - cold atom manipulation . although supervised machine learning and reinforcement learning are widely used for optimizing control parameters in classical systems , quantum control for parameter optimization is mainly pursued via gradient - based greedy algorithms . although the quantum fitness landscape is often compatible with greedy algorithms , sometimes greedy algorithms yield poor results , especially for large - dimensional quantum systems . we employ differential evolution algorithms to circumvent the stagnation problem of non - convex optimization . we improve quantum control fidelity for noisy system by averaging over the objective function . to reduce computational cost , we introduce heuristics for early termination of runs and for adaptive selection of search subspaces . our implementation is massively parallel and vectorized to reduce run time even further . we demonstrate our methods with two examples , namely quantum phase estimation and quantum gate design , for which we achieve superior fidelity and scalability than obtained using greedy algorithms .
