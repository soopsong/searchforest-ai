we present a detailed theoretical analysis for the distillation of one copy of a mixed two - mode continuous - variable entangled state using beamsplitters and coherent photon - detection techniques , including conventional on - off detectors and photon number resolving detectors . the initial gaussian mixed - entangled states are generated by transmitting a two - mode squeezed state through a lossy bosonic channel , corresponding to the primary source of errors in current approaches to optical quantum communication . we provide explicit formulas to calculate the entanglement in terms of logarithmic negativity before and after distillation , including losses in the channel and the photon detection , and show that one - copy distillation is still possible even for losses near the typical fiber channel attenuation length . a lower bound for the transmission coefficient of the photon - subtraction beamsplitter is derived , representing the minimal value that still allows to enhance the entanglement .
