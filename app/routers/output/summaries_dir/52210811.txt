we study the superradiant evolution of a set of $ n$ two - level systems spontaneously radiating under the effect of phase - breaking mechanisms . we investigate the dynamics generated by non - radiative losses and pure dephasing , and their interplay with spontaneous emission . our results show that in the parameter region relevant to many solid - state cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments , even with a dephasing rate much faster than the radiative lifetime of a single two - level system , a sub - optimal collective superfluorescent burst is still observable . we also apply our theory to the dilute excitation regime , often used to describe optical excitations in solid - state systems . in this regime , excitations can be described in terms of bright and dark bosonic quasiparticles . we show how the effect of dephasing and losses in this regime translates into inter - mode scattering rates and quasiparticle lifetimes .
