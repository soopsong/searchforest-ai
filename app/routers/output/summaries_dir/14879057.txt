the density matrix of a qudit may be reconstructed with optimal efficiency if the expectation values of a specific set of observables are known . in dimension six , the required observables only exist if it is possible to identify six mutually unbiased complex 6x6 hadamard matrices . prescribing a first hadamard matrix , we construct all others mutually unbiased to it , using algebraic computations performed by a computer program . we repeat this calculation many times , sampling all known complex hadamard matrices , and we never find more than two that are mutually unbiased . this result adds considerable support to the conjecture that no seven mutually unbiased bases exist in dimension six .
