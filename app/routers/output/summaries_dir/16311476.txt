we review schmidt and kraus decompositions in the form of singular value decomposition using operations of reshaping , vectorization and reshuffling . we use the introduced notation to analyse the correspondence between quantum states and operations with the help of jamiolkowski isomorphism . the presented matrix reorderings allow us to obtain simple formulae for the composition of quantum channels and partial operations used in quantum information theory . to provide examples of the discussed operations we utilize a package for the mathematica computing system implementing basic functions used in the calculations related to quantum information theory .
