we detect -3.2${\pm}$0.2 db of squeezing at 1553.3 nm from a fiber - coupled optical parametric amplification module . the squeezing was observed by homodyne detection using a commercial fiber beamsplitter and a commercial balanced detector . our module consists of a periodically poled linbo3 ( ppln ) ridge waveguide fabricated by photolithography and dry etching , dichroic beamsplitters , lenses and pigtales . the loss of a squeezed vacuum in the module is about 25 % . excluding deterioration due to the measuremental system , the squeezing level at the output fiber of the module is estimated to be -5.7${\pm}$0.2 db . a fiber - coupled source of a high - level squeezed vacuum could help establish continuous - variable quantum information processing with guided - wave .
