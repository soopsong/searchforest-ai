realizing systems that support robust , controlled interactions between individual photons is an exciting frontier of nonlinear optics . to this end , one approach that has emerged recently is to leverage atomic interactions to create strong and spatially non - local interactions between photons . in particular , effective interactions have been successfully created via interactions between atoms excited to rydberg levels . here , we investigate an alternative approach , in which atomic interactions arise via their common coupling to photonic crystal waveguides . this technique takes advantage of the ability to separately tailor the strength and range of interactions via the dispersion engineering of the structure itself , which can lead to qualitatively new types of phenomena . as an example , we discuss the formation of correlated transparency windows , in which photonic states of a certain number and shape selectively propagate through the system . through this technique , we show in particular that one can create molecular - like potentials that lead to molecular bound states of photon pairs .
