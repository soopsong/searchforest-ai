in recent times , there has been much interest in quantum enhancements of machine learning , specifically in the context of data mining and analysis . reinforcement learning , an interactive form of learning , is , in turn , vital in artificial intelligence - type applications . also in this case , quantum mechanics was shown to be useful , in certain instances . here , we elucidate these results , and show that quantum enhancements can be achieved in a new setting : the setting of learning models which learn how to improve themselves -- that is , those that meta - learn . while not all learning models meta - learn , all non - trivial models have the potential of being"lifted " , enhanced , to meta - learning models . our results show that also such models can be quantum - enhanced to make even better learners . in parallel , we address one of the bottlenecks of current quantum reinforcement learning approaches : the need for so - called oracularized variants of task environments . here we elaborate on a method which realizes these variants , with minimal changes in the setting , and with no corruption of the operative specification of the environments . this result may be important in near - term experimental demonstrations of quantum reinforcement learning .
