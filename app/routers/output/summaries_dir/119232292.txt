we study the entanglement entropy ( ee ) of gaussian systems on a lattice with periodic boundary conditions , both in the vacuum and at nonzero temperatures . by restricting the reduced subsystem to periodic sublattices , we can compute the entanglement spectrum and ee exactly . we illustrate this for a free ( 1 + 1)-dimensional massive scalar field at a fixed temperature . consistent with previous literature , we demonstrate that for a sufficiently large periodic sublattice the ee grows extensively , even in the vacuum . furthermore , the analytic expression for the ee allows us probe its behavior both in the massless limit and in the continuum limit at any temperature .
