the unknown temperature of a sample may be estimated with minimal disturbance by putting it in thermal contact with an individual quantum probe . if the interaction time is sufficiently long so that the probe thermalizes , the temperature can be read out directly from its steady state . here we prove that the optimal quantum probe , acting as a thermometer with maximal thermal sensitivity , is an effective two - level atom with a maximally degenerate excited state . when the total interaction time is insufficient to produce full thermalization , we optimize the estimation protocol by breaking it down into sequential stages of probe preparation , thermal contact and measurement . we observe that frequently interrogated probes initialized in the ground state achieve the best performance . for both fully and partly thermalized thermometers , the sensitivity grows significantly with the number of levels , though optimization over their energy spectrum remains always crucial .
