quantum technology promises revolutionizing applications in information processing , communications , sensing , and modelling . however , efficient on - demand cooling of the functional quantum degrees of freedom remains a major challenge in many solid - state implementations , such as superconducting circuits . here , we demonstrate direct cooling of a superconducting resonator mode using voltage - controllable quantum tunneling of electrons in a nanoscale refrigerator . this result is revealed by a decreased electron temperature at a resonator - coupled probe resistor , even when the electrons in the refrigerator itself are at an elevated temperature . our conclusions are verified by control experiments and by a good quantitative agreement between a detailed theoretical model and the direct experimental observations in a broad range of operation voltages and phonon bath temperatures . in the future , the introduced refrigerator can be integrated with different quantum electric devices , potentially enhancing their performance . for the superconducting quantum computer , for example , it may provide an efficient way of initializing the quantum bits .
