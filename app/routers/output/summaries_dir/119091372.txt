we propose a realizable experimental scheme to prepare superposition of the vacuum and one - photon states by truncating an input coherent state . the scheme is based on the quantum scissors device proposed by pegg , phillips , and barnett [ phys . rev . lett . 81 , 1604 ( 1998 ) ] and uses photon - counting detectors , a single - photon source , and linear optical elements . realistic features of the photon counting and single - photon generation are taken into account and possible error sources are discussed together with their effect on the fidelity and efficiency of the truncation process . wigner function and phase distribution of the generated states are given and discussed for the evaluation of the proposed scheme .
