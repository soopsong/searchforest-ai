we propose and demonstrate experimentally a new method based on the spatial entanglement for the absolute calibration of analog detector . the idea consists on measuring the sub - shot - noise intensity correlation between two branches of parametric down conversion , containing many pairwise correlated spatial modes . we calibrate a scientific ccd camera and a preliminary evaluation of the statistical uncertainty indicates the metrological interest of the method .
