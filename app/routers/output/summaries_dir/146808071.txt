topological quantum error - correcting codes are a promising candidate for building fault - tolerant quantum computers . decoding topological codes optimally , however , is known to be a computationally hard problem . various decoders have been proposed that achieve approximately optimal error thresholds . due to practical constraints , it is not known if there exists an obvious choice for a decoder . in this paper , we introduce a framework which can combine arbitrary decoders for any given code to significantly reduce the logical error rates . we rely on the crucial observation that two different decoding techniques , while possibly having similar logical error rates , can perform differently on the same error syndrome . we use machine learning techniques to assign a given error syndrome to the decoder which is likely to decode it correctly . we apply our framework to an ensemble of minimum - weight perfect matching ( mwpm ) and hard - decision re - normalization group ( hdrg ) decoders for the surface code in the depolarizing noise model . our simulations show an improvement of 38.4 % , 14.6 % , and 7.1 % over the pseudo - threshold of mwpm in the instance of distance 5 , 7 , and 9 codes , respectively . lastly , we discuss the advantages and limitations of our framework and applicability to other error - correcting codes . our framework can provide a significant boost to error correction by combining the strengths of various decoders . in particular , it may allow for combining very fast decoders with moderate error - correcting capability to create a very fast ensemble decoder with high error - correcting capability .
