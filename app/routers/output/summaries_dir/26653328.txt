we introduce a new family of quantum secret sharing protocols with limited quantum resources which extends the protocols proposed by markham and sanders and by broadbent , chouha , and tapp . parametrized by a graph g and a subset of its vertices a , the protocol consists in : ( i ) encoding the quantum secret into the corresponding graph state by acting on the qubits in a ; ( ii ) use a classical encoding to ensure the existence of a threshold . these new protocols realize ( ( k , n ) ) quantum secret sharing i.e. , any set of at least k players among n can reconstruct the quantum secret , whereas any set of less than k players has no information about the secret . in the particular case where the secret is encoded on all the qubits , we explore the values of k for which there exists a graph such that the corresponding protocol realizes a ( ( k , n ) ) secret sharing . we show that for any threshold k > n - n^{0.68 } there exists a graph allowing a ( ( k , n ) ) protocol . on the other hand , we prove that for any k<79n/156 there is no graph g allowing a ( ( k , n ) ) protocol . as a consequence there exists n_0 such that the protocols introduced by markham and sanders admit no threshold k when the secret is encoded on all the qubits and n > n_0 .
