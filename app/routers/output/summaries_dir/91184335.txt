the realisation of quantum computers based on molecular electronic spins requires the design of qubits with very long coherence times , t2 . dephasing can proceed over several different microscopic pathways , active at the same time and in different regimes . this makes the rationalisation of the dephasing process not straightforward . here we present a computational methodology able to address spin decoherence processes for a general ensemble of spins . the method consists in the propagation of the unitary quantum spin dynamics on a reduced hilbert space . then we study the dependence of spin dephasing over the magnetic dilution for a crystal of vanadyl - based molecular qubits . our results show the importance of long - range electronic spin - spin interactions and their effect on the shape of the spin - echo signal .
