entangled states play a crucial role in quantum information protocols , thus the dynamical behavior of entanglement is of a great importance . in this paper we consider a two - mode squeezed vacuum state coupled to one thermal reservoir as a model of an entangled state embedded in an environment . as a criterion for entanglement we use a continuous - variable equivalent of the peres - horodecki criterion , namely the simon criterion . to quantify entanglement we use the logarithmic negativity . we derive a condition , which assures that the state remains entangled in spite of the interaction with the reservoir . moreover for the case of interaction with vacuum as an environment we show that a state of interest after intinitely long interaction is not only entangled , but also pure . for comparison we also consider a model in which each of both modes is coupled to its own reservoir .
