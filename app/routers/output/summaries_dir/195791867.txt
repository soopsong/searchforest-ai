the quest for practical cryptographic primitives that are robust against quantum computers is of vital importance for the field of cryptography . among the abundance of different cryptographic primitives one may consider , one - way functions stand out as fundamental building blocks of more complex cryptographic protocols , and they play a central role in modern asymmetric cryptography . we propose a mathematical one - way function , which relies on coarse - grained boson sampling . the evaluation and the inversion of the function are discussed in the context of classical and quantum computers . the present results suggest that the scope and power of boson sampling may go beyond the proof of quantum supremacy , and pave the way towards cryptographic applications .
