boson sampling represents a promising approach to obtain an evidence of the supremacy of quantum systems as a resource for the solution of computational problems . the classical hardness of boson sampling has been related to the so called permanent - of - gaussians conjecture and has been extended to some generalizations such as scattershot boson sampling , approximate and lossy sampling under some reasonable constraints . however , it is still unclear how demanding these techniques are for a quantum experimental sampler . starting from a state of the art analysis and taking account of the foreseeable practical limitations , we evaluate and discuss the bound for quantum supremacy for different recently proposed approaches , accordingly to today 's best known classical simulators .
