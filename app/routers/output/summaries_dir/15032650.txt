a quantum computer is a new type of computer which can solve problems such as factoring and database search very efficiently . the usefulness of a quantum computer is limited by the effect of two different types of errors , decoherence and inaccuracies . in this paper we show the results of simulations of a quantum computer which consider both decoherence and inaccuracies . we simulate circuits which factor the numbers 15 , 21 , 35 , and 57 as well as circuits which use database search to solve the circuit satisfaction problem . our simulations show that the error rate per gate is on the order of 10 ^ -6 for a trapped ion quantum computer whose noise is kept below pi/4096 per gate and with a decoherence rate of 10 ^ -6 . this is an important bound because previous studies have shown that a quantum computer can factor more efficiently than a classical computer if the error rate is of order 10 ^ -6 .
