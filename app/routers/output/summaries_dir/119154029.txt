bound entangled ( be ) states are strange in nature : non - zero amount of free entanglement is required to create them but no free entanglement can be distilled from them under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) . even though usefulness of such states has been shown in several information processing tasks , there exists no simple method to characterize them for an arbitrary composite quantum system . here we present a $ ( d-3)/2$-parameter family of be states each with positive partial transpose ( ppt ) . this family of ppt - be states is introduced by constructing an unextendible product basis ( upb ) in $ \mathbb{c}^d\otimes\mathbb{c}^d$ with $ d$ odd and $ d\ge 5$. the range of each such ppt - be state is contained in a $ 2(d-1)$ dimensional entangled subspace whereas the associated upb - subspace is of dimension $ ( d-1)^2 + 1$. we further show that each of these ppt - be states can be written as a convex combination of $ ( d-1)/2 $ number of rank-4 ppt - be states . moreover , we prove that these rank-4 ppt - be states are extreme points of the convex compact set $ \mathcal{p}$ of all ppt states in $ \mathbb{c}^d\otimes\mathbb{c}^d$ , namely the { \it peres } set . an interesting geometric implication of our result is that the convex hull of these rank-4 ppt - be extreme points -- the $ ( d-3)/2$-simplex -- is sitting on the boundary between the set $ \mathcal{p}$ and the set of non - ppt states . we also discuss consequences of our construction in the context of quantum state discrimination by locc .
