a sequence of controlled collisions between a quantum system and its environment ( composed of a set of quantum objects ) naturally simulates ( with arbitrary precision ) any markovian quantum dynamics of the system under consideration . in this paper we propose and study the problem of simulation of an { \it arbitrary } quantum channel via collision models . we show that a correlated environment is capable to simulate { \it non - markovian } evolutions leading to any indivisible qubit channel . in particular , we derive the corresponding master equation generating a continuous time non - markovian dynamics implementing the universal not gate being an example of the most non - markovian quantum channels .
