we study a device consisting of a dc - squid with two sections of its loop acting as two mechanical resonators . an analog of the parametric down - conversion process in quantum optics can be realized with this device . we show that a two - mode squeezed state can be generated for two overdamped mechanical resonators , where the damping constants of the two mechanical resonators are larger than the coupling strengths between the dc - squid and the two mechanical resonators . thus we show that entangled states of these two mechanical resonators can be generated .
