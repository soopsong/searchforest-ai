the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) is a modification of heisenberg 's principle predicted by several theories of quantum gravity . it consists of a modified commutator between position and momentum . in this work we compute potentially observable effects that gup implies for the harmonic oscillator , coherent and squeezed states in quantum mechanics . in particular , we rigorously analyze the gup - perturbed harmonic oscillator hamiltonian , defining new operators that act as ladder operators on the perturbed states . we use these operators to define the new coherent and squeezed states . we comment on potential applications .
