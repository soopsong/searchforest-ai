we theoretically investigate the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) of a weak probe field in hybrid optomechanics with a single three - level ( $ \lambda$-type ) atomic system . we report that , in the presence of optomechanical coupling and two transition coupling parameters of three - level atom ( tla ) , there occurs three distinct multiple eit windows in the probe absorption spectrum . moreover , the switching of multiple windows into double and single eit windows can be obtained by suitably tuning the system parameters . furthermore , the probe transmission spectrum have been studied . based on our analytical and numerical work , we explain the occurrence of slow and fast light ( superluminal ) regimes , and enhancement of superluminal behaviour in the probe field transmission . this work demonstrates great potential in multi - channel waveguide , fiber optics and classical communication networks , multi - channel quantum information processing , real quality imaging , cloaking devices and delay lines&optical buffers for telecommunication .
