the so - called noon states are quantum optical resources known to be useful especially for quantum lithography and metrology . at the same time , they are known to be very sensitive to photon losses and rather hard to produce experimentally . concerning the former , here we present a scheme where noon states are the elementary resources for building quantum error correction codes against photon losses , thus demonstrating that such resources can also be useful to suppress the effect of loss . our noon - code is an exact code that can be systematically extended from one - photon to higher - number losses . its loss scaling depending on the codeword photon number is the same as for some existing , exact loss codes such as bosonic and quantum parity codes , but its codeword mode number is intermediate between that of the other codes . another generalisation of the noon - code is given for arbitrary logical qudits instead of logical qubits . while , in general , the final codewords are always obtainable from multi - mode noon states through application of beam splitters , both codewords for the one - photon - loss qubit noon - code can be simply created from single - photon states with beam splitters . we give various examples and also discuss a potential application of our qudit code for quantum communication .
