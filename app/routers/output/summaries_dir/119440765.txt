we propose a new scheme of measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc ) using an error - correcting code against photon - loss in circuit quantum electrodynamics . we describe a specific protocol of logical single - qubit gates given by sequential cavity measurements for logical mbqc and a generalised schr\"odinger cat state is used for a continuous - variable ( cv ) logical qubit captured in a microwave cavity . it is assumed that a three cv - qudit entangled state is initially prepared in three jointed cavities and the microwave qudit states are individually controlled , operated , and measured through a readout resonator coupled with an ancillary superconducting qubit . we then examine a practical approach of how to create the cv - qudit cluster state via a cross - kerr interaction induced by intermediary superconducting qubits between neighbouring cavities under the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian . this approach could be scalable for building 2d logical cluster states and therefore will pave a new pathway of logical mbqc in superconducting circuits toward fault - tolerant quantum computing .
