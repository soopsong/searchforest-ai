we show how to convert an arbitrary stabilizer code into a bipartite quantum code . a bipartite quantum code is one that involves two senders and one receiver . the two senders exploit both nonlocal and local quantum resources to encode quantum information with local encoding circuits . they transmit their encoded quantum data to a single receiver who then decodes the transmitted quantum information . the nonlocal resources in a bipartite code are ebits and nonlocal information qubits and the local resources are ancillas and local information qubits . the technique of bipartite quantum error correction is useful in both the quantum communication scenario described above and in fault - tolerant quantum computation . it has application in fault - tolerant quantum computation because we can prepare nonlocal resources offline and exploit local encoding circuits . in particular , we derive an encoding circuit for a bipartite version of the steane code that is local and additionally requires only nearest - neighbor interactions . we have simulated this encoding in the cnot extended rectangle with a publicly available fault - tolerant simulation software . the result is that there is an improvement in the"pseudothreshold"with respect to the baseline steane code , under the assumption that quantum memory errors occur less frequently than quantum gate errors .
