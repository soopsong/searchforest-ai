a transient and high sensitivity sensor based on high - q microcavity is proposed and studied theoretically . there are two ways to realize the transient sensor : monitor the spectrum by fast scanning of probe laser frequency or monitor the transmitted light with fixed laser frequency . for both methods , the non - equilibrium response not only tells the ultrafast environment variance , but also enable higher sensitivity . as examples of application , the transient sensor for nanoparticles adhering and passing by the microcavity is studied . it 's demonstrated that the transient sensor can sense coupling region , external linear variation together with the speed and the size of a nanoparticle . we believe that our researches will open a door to the fast dynamic sensing by microcavity .
