while the novel applications of weak values have recently attracted wide attention , weak measurement , the usual way to extract weak values , suffers from risky approximations and severe quantum noises . in this paper , we show that the weak - value information can be obtained exactly in strong measurement with postselections , via measuring the coupling - deformed pointer observables , i.e. , the observables selected according to the coupling strength . with this approach , we keep all the advantages claimed by weak - measurement schemes and at the same time solve some widely criticized problems thereof , such as the questionable universality , systematical bias , and drastic inefficiency .
