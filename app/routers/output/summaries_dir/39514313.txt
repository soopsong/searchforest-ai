in this paper , we analyse the quantum coherence behaviors of a single qubit in the relativistic regime beyond the single - mode approximation . firstly , we investigate the freezing condition of quantum coherence in fermionic system . we also study the quantum coherence tradeoff between particle and antiparticle sector . it is found that there exists quantum coherence transfer between particle and antiparticle sector , but the coherence lost in particle sector is not entirely compensated by the coherence generation of antiparticle sector . besides , we emphatically discuss the cohering power and decohering power of unruh channel with respect to the computational basis . it is shown that cohering power is vanishing and decohering power is dependent of the choice of unruh mode and acceleration . finally , we compare the behaviors of quantum coherence with geometric quantum discord and entanglement in relativistic setup . our results show that this quantifiers in two region converge at infinite acceleration limit , which implies that this measures become independent of unruh modes beyond the single - mode approximations . it is also demonstrated that the robustness of quantum coherence and geometric quantum discord are better than entanglement under the influence of acceleration , since entanglement undergoes sudden death .
