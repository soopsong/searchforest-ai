the wide - ranging adoption of quantum technologies requires practical , high - performance advances in our ability to maintain quantum coherence while facing the challenge of state collapse under measurement . here we use techniques from control theory and machine learning to predict the future evolution of a qubit 's state ; we deploy this information to suppress stochastic , semiclassical decoherence , even when access to measurements is limited . first , we implement a time - division - multiplexed approach , interleaving measurement periods with periods of unsupervised but stabilised operation during which qubits are available , for e.g. quantum information experiments . second , we employ predictive feedback during sequential but time delayed measurements to reduce the dick effect as encountered in passive frequency standards . both experiments demonstrate significant improvements in qubit phase stability over"traditional"measurement - based feedback approaches by exploiting time domain correlations in the noise processes . this technique requires no additional hardware and is applicable to all two - level quantum systems where projective measurements are possible .
