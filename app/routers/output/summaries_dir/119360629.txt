several superconducting circuit configurations are examined on the existence of super - radiant phase transitions ( srpts ) in thermal equilibrium . for some configurations consisting of artificial atoms , whose circuit diagrams are however not specified , and an lc resonator or a transmission line , we confirm the absence of srpts in the thermal equilibrium following the similar analysis as the no - go theorem for atomic systems . we also show some other configurations where the absence of srpts can not be confirmed .
