in this article we investigate the orbital angular momentum spectrum of photons produced in parametric down conversion process . we study how the transverse profile of the pump mode affects the spectrum as compared to a gaussian pump beam . we show that using perfect optical vortex mode as pump the spectrum can be highly narrowed down . we further study the entanglement between the two down converted photons in the orbital angular momentum basis . we observe that photons entangled in laguerre - gaussian modes exhibit greater higher dimensional entanglement .
