biology achieves novel functions like error correction , ultra - sensitivity and accurate concentration measurement at the expense of free energy through maxwell demon - like mechanisms . the design principles and free energy trade - offs have been studied for a variety of such mechanisms . in this review , we emphasize a perspective based on dynamical phases that can explain commonalities shared by these mechanisms . dynamical phases are defined by typical trajectories executed by non - equilibrium systems in the space of internal states . we find that coexistence of dynamical phases can have dramatic consequences for function vs free energy cost trade - offs . dynamical phases can also provide an intuitive picture of the design principles behind such biological maxwell demons .
