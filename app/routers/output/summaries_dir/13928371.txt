in a previous paper ( math - ph/0205016 ) an euler angle parameterization for su(n ) was given . here we present a generalized euler angle parameterization for u(n ) . the formula for the calculation of the volume for u(n ) , cp(n ) as well as other su(n ) and u(n ) cosets will also be given . in addition , the mixed and pure state product measures for n - dimensional density matrices under this parameterization will also be derived .
