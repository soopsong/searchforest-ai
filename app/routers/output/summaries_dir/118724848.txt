the issue of causality in $ f(t)$ gravity is investigated by examining the possibility of existence of the closed timelike curves in the g\"{o}del - type metric . by assuming a perfect fluid as the matter source , we find that the fluid must have an equation of state parameter greater than minus one in order to allow the g\"{o}del solutions to exist , and furthermore the critical radius $ r_c$ , beyond which the causality is broken down , is finite and it depends on both matter and gravity . remarkably , for certain $ f(t)$ models , the perfect fluid that allows the g\"{o}del - type solutions can even be normal matter , such as pressureless matter or radiation . however , if the matter source is a special scalar field rather than a perfect fluid , then $ r_c\rightarrow\infty$ and the causality violation is thus avoided .
