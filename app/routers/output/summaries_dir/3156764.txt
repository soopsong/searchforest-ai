we present a secure network communication system that operated with decoy - state quantum cryptography in a real - world application scenario . the full key exchange and application protocols were performed in real time among three nodes , in which two adjacent nodes were connected by approximate 20 km of commercial telecom optical fiber . the generated quantum keys were immediately employed and demonstrated for communication applications , including unbreakable real - time voice telephone between any two of the three communication nodes , or a broadcast from one node to the other two nodes by using one - time pad encryption .
