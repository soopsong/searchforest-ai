this article will examine states that superpose different amounts of entanglement and protocols that run in superposition but generate or consume different amounts of entanglement . in both cases we find a uniquely quantum difficulty : entanglement can not be conditionally discarded without either using communication or causing decoherence . i will first describe the problem of entanglement spread in states and operations , as well as some methods of dealing with it . then i 'll describe three applications to problems that at first glance appear to be quite different : first , a reinterpretation of the old observation that creating n partially entangled states from singlets requires theta(sqrt(n ) ) communication , but can not itself be used to communicate ; second , a new lower bound technique for communication complexity ; third , an explanation of how to extend the quantum reverse shannon theorem from tensor power sources to general sources .
