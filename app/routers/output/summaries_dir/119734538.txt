for a quantum channel ( completely positive , trace - preserving map ) , we prove a generalization to the infinite dimensional case of a result by baumgartner and narnhofer . this result is , in a probabilistic language , a decomposition of a general quantum channel into its irreducible positive recurrent components . this decomposition is related with a communication relation on the reference hilbert space . this allows us to describe the full structure of invariant states of a quantum channel , and of their supports .
