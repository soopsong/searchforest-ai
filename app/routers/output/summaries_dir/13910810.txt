informationally complete measurements on a quantum system allow to estimate the expectation value of any arbitrary operator by just averaging functions of the experimental outcomes . we show that such kind of measurements can be achieved through positive - operator valued measures ( povm 's ) related to unitary irreducible representations of a group on the hilbert space of the system . with the help of frame theory we provide a constructive way to evaluate the data - processing function for arbitrary operators .
