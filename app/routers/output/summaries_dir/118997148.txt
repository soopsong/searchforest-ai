we theoretically explore the possibility of a precise measurement of acceleration by using an ultracold gas of scalar bosons in a single potential well . inspired by the fact that the ground state represents a fragmented condensate for sufficiently large interaction , we develop a protocol to realize a mach - zehnder interferometer for the estimation of an acceleration of the system . the splitting process into two modes is in our model entirely caused by the interaction , and is neither due to an externally imposed double - well potential nor due to populating a spinor degree of freedom . we investigate numerically the useful range of parameters for the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) , both when maximized over the set of initial states and when starting the protocol with the fragmented ground state . it is then demonstrated , both for a fragmented state with relatively low degree of fragmentation and for a coherent state , that the two - body interaction significantly enhances the qfi over the one of an ideal interferometer , i.e. , an interferometer in which beam splitting and phase accumulation are completely separated . in particular , we show how a renormalization of the single - particle energy difference between the modes due to the two - body interaction can serve this purpose .
