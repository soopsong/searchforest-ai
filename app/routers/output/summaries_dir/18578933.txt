global degree / strength based preferential attachment is widely used as an evolution mechanism of networks . but it is hard to believe that any individual can get global information and shape the network architecture based on it . in this paper , it is found that the global preferential attachment emerges from the local interaction models , including distance - dependent preferential attachment ( ddpa ) evolving model of weighted networks(m . li et al , new journal of physics 8 ( 2006 ) 72 ) , acquaintance network model(j . davidsen et al , phys . rev . lett . 88 ( 2002 ) 128701 ) and connecting nearest - neighbor(cnn ) model(a . vazquez , phys . rev . e 67 ( 2003 ) 056104 ) . for ddpa model and cnn model , the attachment rate depends linearly on the degree or strength , while for acquaintance network model , the dependence follows a sublinear power law . it implies that for the evolution of social networks , local contact could be more fundamental than the presumed global preferential attachment . this is onsistent with the result observed in the evolution of empirical email networks .
