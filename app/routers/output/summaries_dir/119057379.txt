the optimal quantum control theory is employed to determine electric pulses capable of producing quantum gates with high fidelity ( higher than 0.9997 ) . particularly , these quantum gates were chosen to perform the permutation algorithm ( z. gedik et al . , scientific reports 5 , 14671 , ( 2015 ) . ) in hybrid qubits in a double quantum dot ( dqd ) platform . the permutation algorithm is an oracle based quantum algorithm that solves the problem of the permutation parity faster than a classical algorithm without the necessity of entanglement between particles . the only requirement for achieving the speedup is the use of a one - particle quantum system with at least three levels . the high fidelity found in our results is closely related to quantum speed limit , which is a measure of how fast a quantum state can be manipulated . furthermore , our scheme can be used for the practical realization of different quantum algorithms in dqds .
