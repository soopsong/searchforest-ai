by taking into account the physical nature of quantum errors it is possible to improve the efficiency of quantum error correction . here we consider an optimisation to conventional quantum error correction which involves exploiting asymmetries in the rates of x and z errors by reducing the rate of x correction . as an example , we apply this optimisation to the [ [ 7,1,3 ] ] code and make a comparison with conventional quantum error correction . after two levels of concatenated error correction we demonstrate a circuit depth reduction of at least 43 % and reduction in failure rate of at least 67 % . this improvement requires no additional resources and the required error asymmetry is likely to be present in most physical quantum computer architectures .
