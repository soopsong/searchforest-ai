imaging of the optical properties of individual nanosystems beyond fluorescence can provide a wealth of information . however , the minute signals for absorption and dispersion are challenging to observe , and only specialized techniques requiring sophisticated noise rejection are available . here we use signal enhancement in a scanning optical microcavity to demonstrate ultra - sensitive imaging . harnessing multiple interactions of probe light with a sample within an optical resonator , we achieve a 1700-fold signal enhancement compared to diffraction - limited microscopy . we demonstrate quantitative imaging of the extinction cross section of gold nanoparticles with a sensitivity below 1 nm2 , we show a method to improve spatial resolution potentially below the diffraction limit by using higher order cavity modes , and we present measurements of the birefringence and extinction contrast of gold nanorods . the demonstrated simultaneous enhancement of absorptive and dispersive signals promises intriguing potential for optical studies of nanomaterials , molecules , and biological nanosystems .
