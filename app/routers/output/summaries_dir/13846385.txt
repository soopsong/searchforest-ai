this paper presents formulae for einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) entanglement generated from $ n$ nondegenerate optical parametric amplifiers ( nopas ) interconnected in a linear coherent feedback ( cfb ) chain in the idealized lossless scenario and infinite bandwidth limit . the lossless scenario sets the ultimate epr entanglement ( two - mode squeezing ) that can be achieved by this linear chain of nopas while the infinite bandwidth limit simplifies the analysis but gives an accurate approximation to the epr entanglement at low frequencies of interest . two adjustable phase shifts are placed at the outputs of the system to achieve the best epr entanglement by selecting appropriate quadratures of the output fields .
