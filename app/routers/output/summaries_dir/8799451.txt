we indicate that the nonlinear schr\"odinger equation with white noise dispersion possesses stochastic symplectic and multi - symplectic structures . based on these structures , we propose the stochastic symplectic and multi - symplectic methods , which preserve the continuous and discrete charge conservation laws , respectively . moreover , we show that the proposed methods are convergent with temporal order one in probability . numerical experiments are presented to verify our theoretical results .
