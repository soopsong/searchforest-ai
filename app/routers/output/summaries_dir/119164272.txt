we study some basic and interesting quantum mechanical systems in dynamical noncommutative spaces in which the space- space commutation relations are position dependent . it is observed that the fundamental objects in the dynamical noncommutative space introduced here are stringlike . we show that the stark effect can be employed to determine whether the noncommutativity of space is dynamical or non - dynamical . it appears that unlike non - dynamical case there is a fundamental energy $ \dfrac{\tau\hbar^{2}}{m}$ in this dynamical space . }
