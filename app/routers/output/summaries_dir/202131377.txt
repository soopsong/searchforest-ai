we denote by $ m_k$ the set of $ k$ by $ k$ matrices with complex entries . we consider quantum channels $ \phi_l$ of the form : given a measurable function $ l : m_k\to m_k$ and a measure $ \mu$ on $ m_k$ we define the linear operator $ \phi_l : m_k \to m_k$ , by the law $ \rho \,\to\,\phi_l(\rho ) = \int_{m_k } l(v ) \rho l(v)^\dagger \ , \dm(v).$ on a previous work the authors show that for a fixed measure $ \mu$ it is generic on the function $ l$ the $ \phi$-erg property ( also irreducibility ) . here we will show that the purification property is also generic on $ l$ for a fixed $ \mu$. given $ l$ and $ \mu$ there are two related stochastic process : one takes values on the projective space $ p(\c^k)$ and the other on matrices in $ m_k$. the $ \phi$-erg property and the purification condition are good hypothesis for the discrete time evolution given by the natural transition probability . in this way it will follow that generically on $ l$ , if $ \int |l(v)|^2 \log |l(v)|\ , \ d\mu(v)<\infty$ , then the lyapunov exponents $ \infty>\gamma_1\geq \gamma_2\geq ... \geq \gamma_k\geq -\infty$ are well defined . on the previous work it was presented the concepts of entropy of a channel and of gibbs channel ; and also an example ( associated to a stationary markov chain ) where this definition of entropy ( for a quantum channel ) matches the kolmogorov - shanon definition of entropy . we estimate here the larger lyapunov exponent for the above mentioned example and we show that it is equal to $ -\frac{1}{2 } \,h$ , where $ h$ is the entropy of the associated markov probability .
