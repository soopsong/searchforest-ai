we address the out - of - equilibrium thermodynamics of an isolated quantum system consisting of a cavity optomechanical device . we explore the dynamical response of the system when driven out of equilibrium by a sudden quench of the coupling parameter and compute analytically the full distribution of the work generated by the process . we consider linear and quadratic optomechanical coupling , where the cavity field is parametrically coupled to either the position or the square of the position of a mechanical oscillator , respectively . in the former case we find that the average work generated by the quench is zero , whilst the latter leads to a non - zero average value . through fluctuations theorems we access the most relevant thermodynamical figures of merit , such as the free energy difference and the amount of irreversible work generated . we thus provide a full characterization of the out - of - equilibrium thermodynamics in the quantum regime for nonlinearly coupled bosonic modes . our study is the first due step towards the construction and full quantum analysis of an optomechanical machine working fully out of equilibrium .
