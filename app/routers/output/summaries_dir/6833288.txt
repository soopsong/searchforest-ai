in [ 15 ] we proposed a set of sufficient conditions for the approximate controllability of a discrete - spectrum bilinear schr\"odinger equation . these conditions are expressed in terms of the controlled potential and of the eigenpairs of the uncontrolled schr\"odinger operator . the aim of this paper is to show that these conditions are generic with respect to the uncontrolled and the controlled potential , denoted respectively by $ v$ and $ w$. more precisely , we prove that the schr\"odinger equation is approximately controllable generically with respect to $ w$ when $ v$ is fixed and also generically with respect to $ v$ when $ w$ is fixed and non - constant . the results are obtained by analytic perturbation arguments and through the study of asymptotic properties of eigenfunctions .
