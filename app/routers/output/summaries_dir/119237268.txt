recent efforts to produce single photons via heralding have relied on creating spectrally factorable two - photon states in order to achieve both high purity and high production rate . through a careful multimode analysis , we find , however , that spectral factorability is not necessary . utilizing single - mode detection , a similar or better performance can be achieved with non - factorable states . this conclusion rides on the fact that even when using a broadband filter , a single - mode measurement can still be realized , as long as the coherence time of the triggering photons exceeds the measurement window of the on / off detector .
