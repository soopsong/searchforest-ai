we study the problem of optimal preparation of a bipartite entangled state , which remains entangled the longest time under action of local qubit noises . we show that for unital noises such a state is always maximally entangled , whereas for nonunital noises , it is not . we develop a decomposition technique relating nonunital and unital qubit channels , based on which we find the explicit form of the ultimately robust state for general local noises . we illustrate our findings by amplitude damping processes at finite temperature , for which the ultimately robust state remains entangled up to two times longer than conventional maximally entangled states .
