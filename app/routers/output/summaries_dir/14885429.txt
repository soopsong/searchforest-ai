the aim of the paper is to extend the notion of $ \alpha$-geometry in the classical and in the noncommutative case by introducing a more general class of pull - back metrics and to give concrete formulas for the scalar curvature of these riemannian manifolds . we introduce a more general class of pull - back metrics of the noncommutative state spaces , we pull back the euclidean riemannian metric of the space of self - adjoint matrices with functions which have an analytic extension to a neighborhood of the interval $ ] 0,1[$ and whose derivative are nowhere zero . we compute the scalar curvature in this setting , and as a corollary we have the scalar curvature of the classical probability space when it is endowed with such a general pull - back metric . in the noncommutative setting we consider real and complex state spaces too . we give a simplification of gibilisco 's and isola 's conjecture for the first nontrivial classical probability space and we present the result of a numerical computation which indicate that the conjecture may be true for the space of real and complex qubits .
