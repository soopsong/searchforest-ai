noether 's theorem is a fundamental result in physics stating that every symmetry of the dynamics implies a conservation law . it is , however , deficient in several respects : ( i ) it is not applicable to dynamics wherein the system interacts with an environment , and ( ii ) even in the case where the system is isolated , if the quantum state is mixed then the noether conservation laws do not capture all of the consequences of the symmetries . to address these deficiencies , we introduce measures of the extent to which a quantum state breaks a symmetry . such measures yield novel constraints on state transitions : for nonisolated systems , they can not increase , while for isolated systems they are conserved . we demonstrate that the problem of finding nontrivial asymmetry measures can be solved using the tools of quantum information theory . applications include deriving model - independent bounds on the quantum noise in amplifiers and assessing quantum schemes for achieving high - precision metrology .
