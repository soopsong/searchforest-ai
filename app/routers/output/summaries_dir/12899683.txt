we demonstrate a compact , robust , and highly efficient source of polarization - entangled photons , based on linear bi - directional down - conversion in a novel ' folded sandwich ' configuration . bi - directionally pumping a single periodically poled ktiopo$_4 $ ( ppktp ) crystal with a 405-nm laser diode , we generate entangled photon pairs at the non - degenerate wavelengths 784 nm ( signal ) and 839 nm ( idler ) , and achieve an unprecedented detection rate of 11.8 kcps for 10.4 $ \mu$w of pump power ( 1.1 million pairs / mw ) , in a 2.9-nm bandwidth , while maintaining a very high two - photon entanglement quality , with a bell - state fidelity of $ 99.3\pm0.3$% .
