transport phenomena represent a very interdisciplinary topic with applications in many fields of science , such as physics , chemistry , and biology . in this context , the possibility to design a perfectly controllable experimental setup , where to tune and optimize its dynamics parameters , is a challenging but very relevant task to emulate , for instance , the transmission of energy in light harvesting processes . here , we experimentally build a scalable and controllable transport emulator based on optical fiber cavity networks where the system noise parameters can be finely tuned while maximizing the transfer efficiency . in particular , we demonstrate that disorder and dephasing noise are two control knobs allowing one to play with constructive and destructive interference to optimize the transport paths towards an exit site . these optical setups , on one side , mimic the transport dynamics in natural photosynthetic organisms and , on the other , are very promising platforms to artificially design optimal nanoscale structures for novel , more efficient , clean energy technologies .
