incoherence in the controlled hamiltonian is an important limitation on the precision of coherent control in quantum information processing . incoherence can typically be modelled as a distribution of unitary processes arising from slowly varying experimental parameters . we show how it introduces artifacts in quantum process tomography and we explain how the resulting estimate of the superoperator may not be completely positive . we then go on to attack the inverse problem of extracting an effective distribution of unitaries that characterizes the incoherence via a perturbation theory analysis of the superoperator eigenvalue spectra .
