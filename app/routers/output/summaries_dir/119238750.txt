trapping ultracold atoms in optical lattices enabled numerous breakthroughs uniting several disciplines . coupling these systems to quantized light leads to a plethora of new phenomena and has opened up a new field of study . here we introduce a physically novel source of competition in a many - body strongly correlated system : we prove that quantum backaction of global measurement is able to efficiently compete with intrinsic short - range dynamics of an atomic system . the competition becomes possible due to the ability to change the spatial profile of a global measurement at a microscopic scale comparable to the lattice period without the need of single site addressing . in coherence with a general physical concept , where new competitions typically lead to new phenomena , we demonstrate novel nontrivial dynamical effects such as large - scale multimode oscillations , long - range entanglement and correlated tunneling , as well as selective suppression and enhancement of dynamical processes beyond the projective limit of the quantum zeno effect . we demonstrate both the break - up and protection of strongly interacting fermion pairs by measurement . such a quantum optical approach introduces into many - body physics novel processes , objects , and methods of quantum engineering , including the design of many - body entangled environments for open systems .
