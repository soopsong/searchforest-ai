we analyze correlations between pairs of particle detectors quadratically coupled to a real scalar field . we find that , while a single quadratically coupled detector presents no divergences , when one considers pairs of detectors there emerge unanticipated persistent divergences ( not regularizable via smooth switching or smearing ) in the entanglement they acquire from the field . we have characterized such divergences , discussed whether a suitable regularization can allow for fair comparison of the entanglement harvesting ability of the quadratic and the linear couplings , and finally we have found a uv - safe quantifier of harvested correlations . our results are relevant to future studies of the entanglement structure of the fermionic vacuum .
