in the past years , quantum computers more and more have evolved from an academic idea to an upcoming reality . ibm 's project ibm q can be seen as evidence of this progress . launched in march 2017 with the goal to provide access to quantum computers for a broad audience , this allowed users to conduct quantum experiments on a 5-qubit and , since june 2017 , also on a 16-qubit quantum computer ( called ibm qx2 and ibm qx3 , respectively ) . revised versions of these 5-qubit and 16-qubit quantum computers ( named ibm qx4 and ibm qx5 , respectively ) are available since september 2017 . in order to use these , the desired quantum functionality ( e.g. provided in terms of a quantum circuit ) has to be properly mapped so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied - a complex task . this demands solutions to automatically and efficiently conduct this mapping process . in this paper , we propose a methodology which addresses this problem , i.e. maps the given quantum functionality to a realization which satisfies all constraints given by the architecture and , at the same time , keeps the overhead in terms of additionally required quantum gates minimal . the proposed methodology is generic , can easily be configured for similar future architectures , and is fully integrated into ibm 's sdk . experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms ibm 's own mapping solution . in fact , for many quantum circuits , the proposed approach determines a mapping to the ibm architecture within minutes , while ibm 's solution suffers from long runtimes and runs into a timeout of 1 hour in several cases . as an additional benefit , the proposed approach yields mapped circuits with smaller costs ( i.e. fewer additional gates are required ) . all implementations of the proposed methodology is publicly available at http://iic.jku.at/eda/research/ibm_qx_mapping .
