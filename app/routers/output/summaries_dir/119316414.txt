we investigate properties of generalized time - dependent q - deformed coherent states for a noncommutative harmonic oscillator . the states are shown to satisfy a generalized version of heisenberg 's uncertainty relations . for the initial value in time the states are demonstrated to be squeezed , i.e. the inequalities are saturated , whereas when time evolves the uncertainty product oscillates away from this value albeit still respecting the relations . for the canonical variables on a noncommutative space we verify explicitly that ehrenfest 's theorem hold at all times . we conjecture that the model exhibits revival times to infinite order . explicit sample computations for the fractional revival times and superrevival times are presented .
