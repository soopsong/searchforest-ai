important tasks in cavity quantum electrodynamics include the generation and control of quantum states of spatially - separated particles distributed in different cavities . an interesting question in this context is how to prepare entanglement among particles located in different cavities , which are important for large - scale quantum information processing . we here consider a multi - cavity system where cavities are coupled to a superconducting ( sc ) qubit and each cavity hosts many sc qubits . we show that all intra - cavity sc qubits plus the coupler sc qubit can be prepared in an entangled greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state , by using a single operation and without the need of measurements . the ghz state is created without exciting the cavity modes ; thus greatly suppressing the decoherence caused by the cavity - photon decay and the effect of unwanted inter - cavity crosstalk on the operation . we also introduce two simple methods for entangling the intra - cavity sc qubits in a ghz state . as an example , our numerical simulations show that it is feasible , with current circuit - qed technology , to prepare high - fidelity ghz states , for up to nine sc qubits by using sc qubits distributed in two cavities . this proposal can in principle be used to implement a ghz state for { \it an arbitrary number } of sc qubits distributed in multiple cavities . the proposal is quite general and can be applied to a wide range of physical systems , with the intra - cavity qubits being either atoms , nv centers , quantum dots , or various sc qubits .
