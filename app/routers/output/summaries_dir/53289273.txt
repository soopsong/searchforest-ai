in this paper we consider to use the quantum stabilizer codes as secret sharing schemes for classical secrets . we give necessary and sufficient conditions for qualified and forbidden sets in terms of quantum stabilizers . then we give a gilbert - varshamove - type sufficient condition for existence of secret sharing schemes with given parameters , and by using that sufficient condition , we show that roughly 19 % of participants can be made forbidden independently of the size of classical secret , in particular when an $ n$-bit classical secret is shared among $ n$ participants having 1-qubit share each . we also consider how much information is obtained by an intermediate set and express that amount of information in terms of quantum stabilizers . all the results are stated in terms of linear spaces over finite fields associated with the quantum stabilizers .
