we investigate a recent conjecture connecting the ads / cft correspondence and entanglement renormalization tensor network states ( mera ) . the proposal interprets the tensor connectivity of the mera states associated to quantum many body systems at criticality , in terms of a dual holographic geometry which accounts for the qualitative aspects of the entanglement and the correlations in these systems . in this work , some generic features of the entanglement entropy and the two point functions in the ground state of one dimensional gapped systems are considered through a tensor network state . the tensor network is builded up as an hybrid composed by a finite number of mera layers and a matrix product state ( mps ) acting as a cap layer . using the holographic formula for the entanglement entropy , here it is shown that an asymptotically ads metric can be associated to the hybrid mera - mps state . the metric is defined by a function that manages the growth of the minimal surfaces near the capped region of the geometry . namely , it is shown how the behaviour of the entanglement entropy and the two point correlators in the tensor network , remains consistent with a geometric computation which only depends on this function . from these observations , an explicit connection between the entanglement structure of the tensor network and the function which defines the geometry is provided .
