we explore the propagation and transformation of electromagnetic waves through spatially homogeneous yet smoothly time - dependent media within the framework of classical electrodynamics . by modelling the smooth transition , occurring during a finite period { \tau } , as a phenomenologically realistic and sigmoidal change of the dielectric permittivity , an analytically exact solution to maxwell 's equations is derived for the electric displacement in terms of hypergeometric functions . using this solution , we show the possibility of amplification and attenuation of waves and associate this with the decrease and increase of the time - dependent permittivity . we demonstrate , moreover , that such an energy exchange between waves and non - stationary media leads to the transformation ( or conversion ) of frequencies . our results may pave the way towards controllable light - matter interaction in time - varying structures .
