we present two quantum memory protocols for solids : a stopped light approach based on spectral hole burning and the storage in an atomic frequency comb . these procedures are well adapted to the rare - earth ion doped crystals . we carefully clarify the critical steps of both . on one side , we show that the slowing - down due to hole - burning is sufficient to produce a complete mapping of field into the atomic system . on the other side , we explain the storage and retrieval mechanism of the atomic frequency comb protocol . this two important stages are implemented experimentally in tm$^{3+}$- doped yttrium - aluminum - garnet crystal .
