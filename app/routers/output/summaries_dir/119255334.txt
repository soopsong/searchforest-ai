when two operators $ a$ and $ b$ do not commute , the calculation of the exponential operator $ e^{a+b}$ is a difficult and crucial problem . the applications are vast and diversified : to name but a few examples , quantum evolutions , product formulas , quantum control , zeno effect . the latter are of great interest in quantum applications and quantum technologies . we present here a historical survey of results and techniques , and discuss differences and similarities . we also highlight the link with the strong coupling regime , via the adiabatic theorem , and contend that the"pulsed"and"continuous"formulations differ only in the order by which two limits are taken , and are but two faces of the same coin .
