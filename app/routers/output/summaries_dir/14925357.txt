quantum dynamics can be regarded as a generalization of classical finite - state dynamics . this is a familiar viewpoint for workers in quantum computation , which encompasses classical computation as a special case . here this viewpoint is extended to mechanics , where classical dynamics has traditionally been viewed as a macroscopic approximation of quantum behavior , not as a special case . when a classical dynamics is recast as a special case of quantum dynamics , the quantum description can be interpreted classically . for example , sometimes extra information is added to the classical state in order to construct the quantum description . this extra information is then eliminated by representing it in a superposition as if it were unknown information about a classical statistical ensemble . this usage of superposition leads to the appearance of fermions in the quantum description of classical lattice - gas dynamics and turns continuous - space descriptions of finite - state systems into illustrations of classical sampling theory . a direct mapping of classical systems onto quantum systems also allows us to determine the minimum possible energy scale for a classical dynamics , based on a localized rate of state change . we use a partitioning description of dynamics to define locality , and discuss the ideal energy of two model systems .
