we demonstrate generation of high - purity photon pairs at 1560 nm in a single spatial mode from a periodically - poled ktiopo_4 ( ppktp ) waveguide . with nearly lossless spectral filtering , the ppktp waveguide source shows approximately 80 % single - mode fiber coupling efficiency and is well suited for high - dimensional time - energy entanglement - based quantum key distribution . using high - count - rate self - differencing ingaas single - photon avalanche photodiodes configured with either square or sinusoidal gating , we achieve>1 mbit / s raw key generation with 3 bits - per - photon encoding , and , to the best of our knowledge , the highest reported franson quantum - interference visibility of 98.2 % without subtraction of accidental coincidences .
