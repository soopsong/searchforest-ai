we study the quantum - jump - based feedback control on the entanglement shared between two qubits with one of them subject to decoherence , while the other qubit is under the control . this situation is very relevant to a quantum system consisting of nuclear and electron spins in solid states . the possibility to prolong the coherence time of the dissipative qubit is also explored . numerical simulations show that the quantum - jump - based feedback control can improve the entanglement between the qubits and prolong the coherence time for the qubit subject directly to decoherence .
