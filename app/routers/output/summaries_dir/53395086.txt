we present an experimental demonstration of a quantum key distribution protocol using coherent polarization states . post selection is used to ensure a low error rate and security against beam splitting attacks even in the presence of high losses . signal encoding and readout in polarization bases avoids the difficult task of sending a local oscillator with the quantum channel . this makes our setup robust and easy to implement . a shared key was established for losses up to 64 % .
