we present a continuous - variable quantum repeater scheme for entanglement distribution over a lossy bosonic channel using two - mode squeezed vacuum state sources . the scheme uses the quantum scissors operation for entanglement distillation . rates per - use of the channel achieved by the scheme are boosted by a layer of switched channel multiplexing . by suitably choosing the entanglement source and distillation parameters , degree of channel multiplexing and number of repeater nodes , the scheme is shown to beat the direct transmission exponential rate - loss trade - off .
