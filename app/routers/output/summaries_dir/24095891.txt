we show how an interaction with the environment can enhance fidelity of quantum teleportation . to this end , we present examples of states which can not be made useful for teleportation by any local unitary transformations ; nevertheless , after being subjected to a dissipative interaction with the local environment , the states allow for teleportation with genuinely quantum fidelity . the surprising fact here is that the necessary interaction does not require any intelligent action from the parties sharing the states . in passing , we produce some general results regarding optimization of teleportation fidelity by local action . we show that bistochastic processes can not improve fidelity of two - qubit states . we also show that in order to have their fidelity improvable by a local process , the bipartite states must violate the so - called reduction criterion of separability .
