in order to demonstrate non - trivial quantum computations experimentally , such as the synthesis of arbitrary entangled states , it will be useful to understand how to decompose a desired quantum computation into the shortest possible sequence of one - qubit and two - qubit gates . we contribute to this effort by providing a method to construct an optimal quantum circuit for a general two - qubit gate that requires at most 3 cnot gates and 15 elementary one - qubit gates . moreover , if the desired two - qubit gate corresponds to a purely real unitary transformation , we provide a construction that requires at most 2 cnots and 12 one - qubit gates . we then prove that these constructions are optimal with respect to the family of cnot , y - rotation , z - rotation , and phase gates .
