physical constraints make it challenging to implement and control many - body interactions . for this reason , designing quantum information processes with hamiltonians consisting of only one- and two - local terms is a worthwhile challenge . enabling error suppression with two - local hamiltonians is particularly challenging . a no - go theorem of marvian and lidar [ physical review letters 113(26 ) , 260504 ( 2014 ) ] demonstrates that , even allowing particles with high hilbert - space dimension , it is impossible to protect quantum information from single - site errors by encoding in the ground subspace of any hamiltonian containing only commuting two - local terms . here , we get around this no - go result by encoding in the ground subspace of a hamiltonian consisting of non - commuting two - local terms arising from the gauge operators of a subsystem code . specifically , we show how to protect stored quantum information against single - qubit errors using a hamiltonian consisting of sums of the gauge generators from bacon - shor codes [ physical review a 73(1 ) , 012340 ( 2006 ) ] and generalized - bacon - shor code [ physical review a 83(1 ) , 012320 ( 2011 ) ] . our results imply that non - commuting two - local hamiltonians have more error - suppressing power than commuting two - local hamiltonians . while far from providing full fault tolerance , this approach improves the robustness achievable in near - term implementable quantum storage and adiabatic quantum computations , reducing the number of higher - order terms required to encode commonly used adiabatic hamiltonians such as the ising hamiltonians common in adiabatic quantum optimization and quantum annealing .
