we present an experimentally feasible scheme to implement holonomic quantum computation in the ultrastrong - coupling regime of light - matter interaction . the large anharmonicity and the z2 symmetry of the quantum rabi model allow us to build an effective three - level { \lambda}-structured artificial atom for quantum computation . the proposed physical implementation includes two gradiometric flux qubits and two microwave resonators where single - qubit gates are realized by a two - tone driving on one physical qubit , and a two - qubit gate is achieved with a time - dependent coupling between the field quadratures of both resonators . our work paves the way for scalable holonomic quantum computation in ultrastrongly coupled systems .
