we have studied the optical properties of gratings micro - fabricated into semiconductor wafers , which can be used for simplifying cold - atom experiments . the study entailed characterisation of diffraction efficiency as a function of coating , periodicity , duty cycle and geometry using over 100 distinct gratings . the critical parameters of experimental use , such as diffraction angle and wavelength are also discussed , with an outlook to achieving optimal ultracold experimental conditions .
