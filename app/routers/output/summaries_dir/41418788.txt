measurement - based quantum computing ( mbqc ) is an alternative to the quantum circuit model , whereby the computation proceeds via measurements on an entangled resource state . noise processes are a major experimental challenge to the construction of a quantum computer . here , we investigate how noise processes affecting physical states affect the performed computation by considering mbqc on a one - dimensional cluster state . this allows us to break down the computation in a sequence of building blocks and map physical errors to logical errors . next , we extend the matrix product state construction to mixed states ( which is known as matrix product operators ) and once again map the effect of physical noise to logical noise acting within the correlation space . this approach allows us to consider more general errors than the conventional pauli errors , and could be used in order to simulate noisy quantum computation .
