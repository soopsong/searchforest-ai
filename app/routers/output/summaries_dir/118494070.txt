the present study investigates the interaction of an equidistant three - level atom and a single - mode cavity field that has been initially prepared in a generalized coherent state . the atom - field interaction is considered to be , in general , intensity - dependent . we suppose that the nonlinearity of the initial generalized coherent state of the field and the intensity - dependent coupling between atom and field are distinctly chosen . interestingly , an exact analytical solution for the time evolution of the state of atom - field system can be found in this general regime in terms of the nonlinearity functions . finally , the presented formalism has been applied to a few known physical systems such as gilmore - perelomov and barut - girardello coherent states of su(1,1 ) group , as well as a few special cases of interest . mean photon number and atomic population inversion will be calculated , in addition to investigating particular non - classicality features such as revivals , sub - poissonian statistics and quadratures squeezing of the obtained states of the entire system . also , our results will be compared with some of the earlier works in this particular subject .
