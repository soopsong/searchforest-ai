electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) has usually been demonstrated by using three - level atomic systems . in this paper , we theoretically proposed an efficient method to realize eit in microwave regime through a coupled system consisting of a flux qubit and a superconducting lc resonator with relatively high quality factor . in the present composed system , the working levels are the dressed states of a two - level flux qubit and the resonators with a probe pump field . there exits a second order coherent transfer between the dressed states . by comparing the results with those in the conventional atomic system we have revealed the physical origin of the eit phenomenon in this composed system . since the whole system is artificial and tunable , our scheme may have potential applications in various domains .
