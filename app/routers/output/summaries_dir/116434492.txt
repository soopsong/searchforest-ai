a central problem in quantum computing is to identify computational tasks which can be solved substantially faster on a quantum computer than on any classical computer . by studying the hardest such tasks , known as bqp - complete problems , we deepen our understanding of the power and limitations of quantum computers . we present several bqp - complete problems , including local hamiltonian eigenvalue sampling and phase estimation sampling . different than the previous known bqp - complete problems ( the quadratically signed weight enumerator problem [ kl01 ] and the approximation of jones polynomials [ fkw02 , flw02 , ajl06 ] ) , our problems are of a basic linear algebra nature and are closely related to the well - known quantum algorithm and quantum complexity theories .
