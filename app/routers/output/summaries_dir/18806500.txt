we present two new quantum algorithms . our first algorithm is a generalization of amplitude amplification to the case when parts of the quantum algorithm that is being amplified stop at different times . our second algorithm uses the first algorithm to improve the running time of harrow et al . algorithm for solving systems of linear equations from o(kappa^2 log n ) to o(kappa log^3 kappa log n ) where \kappa is the condition number of the system of equations .
