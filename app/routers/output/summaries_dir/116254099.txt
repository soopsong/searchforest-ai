a star collapsing gravitationally into a black hole emits a flux of radiation , known as hawking radiation . when the initial state of a quantum field on the background of the star , is placed in the unruh vacuum in the far past , then in the exterior hawking radiation corresponds to a flux of positive energy radiation travelling outwards from near the surface to future infinity . based on pair creation , the evaporation of the collapsing star can be equivalently described by the absorption of an ingoing negative energy flux of radiation travelling towards the center of the star . here , we are interested in the evolution of the star during its collapse . thus we include the backreaction of the negative energy hawking flux in the interior geometry of the collapsing star when writing the full 4-dimensional einstein and hydrodynamic equations . hawking radiation emitted before the star passes through its schwarzschild radius slows down and reverses the collapse of the star . the star evaporates without forming an horizon or a singularity . this study provides a more realistic investigation than the one first presented in [ 1 ] , since the backreaction of hawking radiation flux on the collapsing star is studied in the case when the initial state of the field is in unruh 's vacuum .
