we show that the maximum transmission distance of continuous - variable quantum key distribution in presence of a gaussian noisy lossy channel can be arbitrarily increased using a linear noiseless amplifier . we explicitly consider a protocol using amplitude and phase modulated coherent states with reverse reconciliation . we find that a noiseless amplifier with amplitude gain g can increase the maximum admissible losses by a factor 1 / g^2 .
