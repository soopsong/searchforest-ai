random numbers are a fundamental resource in science and technology . among the different approaches to generating them , random numbers created by exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics have proven to be reliable and can be produced at enough rates for their practical use . while these demonstrations have shown very good performance , most of the implementations using free - space and fibre optics , suffer from limitations due to their size , which strongly limits their practical use . here we report a quantum random number generator based on phase fluctuations from a diode laser , where the other required optical components are integrated on a mm - scale monolithic silicon - on - insulator chip . our device operates with generation rate in the gbps regime and the output random numbers pass the nist statistical tests . considering the device 's size , its simple , robust and low power operation , and the rapid industrial uptake of silicon photonics , we foresee the widespread integration of the reported design in more complex systems .
