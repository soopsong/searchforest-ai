this paper investigates the fast hamiltonian control of $ n=2 $ density operators by continuously varying the flag as one moves away from the completely mixed state . in general , the critical points and zeros of the purity derivative can only be solved analytically in the limit of minimal purity . we derive differential equations that maintain these features as the purity increases . in particular , there is a thread of points in the bloch ball that locally maximizes the purity derivative , and a corresponding thread that minimizes it . additionally , we show there is a closed surface of points inside of which the purity derivative is positive , and inside of which is negative . we argue that this approach may be useful in studying higher - dimensional systems .
