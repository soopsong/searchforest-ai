we study the dissipative dynamics of an atom in a v - level configuration driven by lasers and coupled to a semi - infinite waveguide . the coupling to the waveguide is chiral , in that each transition interacts only with the modes propagating in a given direction , and this direction is opposite for the two transitions . the waveguide is terminated by a mirror which coherently feeds the photon stream emitted by one transition back to the atom . first , we are interested in the dynamics of the atom in the markovian limit where the time - delay in the feedback is negligible . specifically , we study the conditions under which the atom evolves towards a pure"dark"stationary state , where the photons emitted by both transitions interfere destructively thanks to the coherent feedback , and the overall emission vanishes . this is a single - atom analog of the quantum dimer , where a pair of laser - driven two - level atoms is coupled to a unidirectional waveguide and dissipates towards a pure entangled dark state . our setup should be feasible with current state - of - the - art experiments . second , we extend our study to non - markovian regimes and investigate the effect of the feedback retardation on the steady - state .
