we propose a method for extracting an errorless secret key in a continuous - variable quantum key distribution protocol , which is based on gaussian modulation of coherent states and homodyne detection . the crucial feature is an eight - dimensional reconciliation method , based on the algebraic properties of octonions . since the protocol does not use any postselection , it can be proven secure against arbitrary collective attacks , by using well - established theorems on the optimality of gaussian attacks . by using this new coding scheme with an appropriate signal to noise ratio , the distance for secure continuous - variable quantum key distribution can be significantly extended .
