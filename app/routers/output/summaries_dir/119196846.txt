we theoretically and numerically investigate the temperature - dependent properties of the biphotons generated from four isomorphs of periodically poled $ \mathrm{ktiopo_4}$ ( ppktp ) : i.e. , pprtp , ppkta , pprta and ppcta . it is discovered that the first type of group - velocity - matched ( gvm ) wavelength is decreased by 6.4 , 1.2 , 8.9 , 25.6 and 6.3 nm , while the phase - matched wavelength is decreased by 4.4 , -0.4 , -1.2 , 29.1 and 59.5 nm for ppktp , pprtp , ppkta , pprta and ppcta , respectively , when the temperature is increased from 20$\,^{\circ}\mathrm{c}$ to 120$\,^{\circ}\mathrm{c}$. although the maximal spectral purity of the heralded single photons is not changed at different temperature , the hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interference shows different patterns due to a shift of the joint spectral amplitude . these thermal effects are very important for precise control of the quantum state for the future applications in quantum information processing , for example , in quantum interference or spectroscopy .
