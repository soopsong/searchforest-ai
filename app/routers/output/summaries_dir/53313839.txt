we propose to manipulate the statistic properties of the photons transport nonreciprocally via quadratic optomechanical coupling . we present a scheme to generate quadratic optomechanical interactions in the normal optical modes of a whispering - gallery - mode ( wgm ) optomechanical system by eliminating the linear optomechanical couplings via anticrossing of different modes . by optically pumping the wgm optomechanical system in one direction , the effective quadratic optomechanical coupling in that direction will be enhanced significantly , and nonreciprocal photon blockade will be observed consequently . our proposal has potential applications for the on - chip nonreciprocal single - photon devices .
