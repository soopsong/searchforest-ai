we study the radiation produced by an accelerated time - delay acting on the left moving modes . through analysis via the schrodinger picture , we find that the final state is a two - mode squeezed state of the left moving unruh modes , implying particle production . we analyse the system from an operational point of view via the use of self - homodyne detection with broad - band inertial detectors . we obtain semi - analytical solutions that show that the radiation appears decohered when such an inertial observer analyses the information of the radiation from the accelerated time - delay source . we make connection with the case of the accelerated mirror . we investigate the operational conditions under which the signal observed by the inertial observer can be purified .
