the security proofs of continuous - variable quantum key distribution are based on the assumptions that the eavesdropper can neither act on the local oscillator nor control bob 's beam splitter . these assumptions may be invalid in practice due to potential imperfections in the implementations of such protocols . in this paper , we consider the problem of transmitting the local oscillator in a public channel and propose a wavelength attack which can allow the eavesdropper to control the intensity transmission of bob 's beam splitter by switching the wavelength of the input light . specifically we target continuous - variable quantum key distribution systems that use the heterodyne detection protocol using either direct or reverse reconciliation . our attack is proved to be feasible and renders all of the final key shared between the legitimate parties insecure , even if they have monitored the intensity of the local oscillator . to prevent our attack on commercial systems , a simple wavelength filter should be added before performing the monitoring detection .
