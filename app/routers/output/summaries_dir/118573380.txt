we study the dynamical properties of the quantum rabi model within a systematic expansion method . based on the observation that the parity symmetry of the rabi model is kept during the evolution of the states , we decompose the initial state and the time - dependent one into a part of a positive and a negative parity expanded by the superposition of the coherent states . the evolutions for the corresponding positive and the negative parity are obtained , where the expansion coefficients in the dynamical equations are known from the recurrence relation derived .
