we consider the problem of estimating an arbitrary dynamical parameter of an quantum open system in the input - output formalism . for irreducible markov processes , we show that in the limit of large times the system - output state can be approximated by a quantum gaussian state whose mean is proportional to the unknown parameter . this approximation holds locally in a neighbourhood of size $ t^{-1/2}$ in the parameter space , and provides an explicit expression of the asymptotic quantum fisher information in terms of the markov generator . furthermore we show that additive statistics of the counting and homodyne measurements also satisfy local asymptotic normality and we compute the corresponding classical fisher informations . the mathematical theorems are illustrated with the examples of a two - level system and the atom maser . our results contribute towards a better understanding of the statistical and probabilistic properties of the output process , with relevance for quantum control engineering , and the theory of non - equilibrium quantum open systems .
