it has been suggested that excitation transport in photosynthetic light harvesting complexes features speedups analogous to those found in quantum algorithms . here we compare the dynamics in these light harvesting systems to the dynamics of quantum walks , in order to elucidate the limits of such quantum speedups . for the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex of green sulfur bacteria , we show that while there is indeed speedup at short times , this is short lived ( 70 fs ) despite longer lived ( ps ) quantum coherence . remarkably , this time scale is independent of the details of the decoherence model . more generally , we show that the distinguishing features of light - harvesting complexes not only limit the extent of quantum speedup but also reduce rates of diffusive transport . these results suggest that quantum coherent effects in biological systems are optimized for efficiency or robustness rather than the more elusive goal of quantum speedup .
