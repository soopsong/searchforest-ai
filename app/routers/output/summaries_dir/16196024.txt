we analyze the algebra of observables of a charged particle on a noncommutative torus in a constant magnetic field . we present a set of generators of this algebra which coincide with the generators for a commutative torus but at a different value of the magnetic field , and demonstrate the existence of a critical value of the magnetic field for which the algebra reduces . we then obtain the irreducible representations of the algebra and relate them to noncommutative bundles . finally we comment on landau levels , density of states and the critical case .
