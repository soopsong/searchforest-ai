quantum sorter has gained a lot of attention during the last years due to its wide application in quantum information processing and quantum technologies . a challenging task is the construction of a quantum sorter , which collect many high - dimensional quantum systems , which are simultaneously incident on different input ports of the device . in this paper we give the definition of the general quantum sorter of multi - level quantum systems . we prove the impossibility of the construction of the perfect quantum sorter , which works for many particles incident on any input port , while keeping their states unmodified . further we propose an approximate multi - particle multi - input - port quantum sorter , which performs the selection of the particles in a certain output port according to the properties of the initial states , but changing the final states . this method is useful for those situations which require high speed of quantum state sorting . thus , the information contained in the initial states of the particles is revealed by the click statistics of the detectors situated in each output port .
