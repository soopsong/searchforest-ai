we propose a method to improve the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) via dissipative quantum dynamics , taking into account the dephasing effects . fast and robust population transfer can be obtained with the scheme by the designed pulses and detuning , even though the initial state of the system is imperfect . with a concrete three - level system as an example , the influences of the imperfect initial state , variations in the control parameters , and various dissipation effects are discussed in detail . the numerical simulation shows that the scheme is insensitive to moderate fluctuations of experimental parameters and the relatively large dissipation effects of the excited state . furthermore , the dominant dissipative factors , namely , the dephasing effects of the ground states and the imperfect initial state are no longer undesirable , in fact , they are the important resources to the scheme . therefore , the scheme could provide more choices for the realization of the complete population transfer in the strong dissipative fields
