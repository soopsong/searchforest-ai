we examine the notion of nonclassicality in terms of quasiprobability distributions . in particular , we do not only ask if a specific quasiprobability can be interpreted as a classical probability density , but require that characteristic features of classical electrodynamics are resembled . we show that the only quasiprobabilities which correctly describe the superposition principle of classical electromagnetic fields are the $ s$-parameterized quasiprobabilities . furthermore , the glauber - sudarshan p function is the only quantum - mechanical quasiprobability which is transformed at a classical attenuator in the same way as a classical probability distribution . this result strengthens the definition of nonclassicality in terms of the p function , in contrast to possible definitions in terms of other quasiprobabilities .
