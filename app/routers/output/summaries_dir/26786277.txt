stimulated brillouin interactions mediate nonlinear coupling between photons and acoustic phonons through an optomechanical three - wave interaction . though these nonlinearities were previously very weak in silicon photonic systems , the recent emergence of new optomechanical waveguide structures have transformed brillouin processes into one of the strongest and most tailorable on - chip nonlinear interactions . new technologies based on brillouin couplings have formed a basis for amplification , filtering , and nonreciprocal signal processing techniques . in this paper , we demonstrate strong guided - wave brillouin scattering between light fields guided in distinct spatial modes of a silicon waveguide for the first time . this inter - modal coupling creates dispersive symmetry breaking between stokes and anti - stokes processes , permitting single - sideband amplification and wave dynamics that permit near - unity power conversion . combining these physics with integrated mode - multiplexers enables novel device topologies and eliminates the need for optical circulators or narrowband spectral filtering to separate pump and signal waves as in traditional brillouin processes . we demonstrate 3.5 db of optical gain , over 2.3 db of net amplification , and 50 % single - sideband energy transfer between two optical modes in a pure silicon waveguide , expanding the design space for flexible on - chip light sources , amplifiers , nonreciprocal devices , and signal processing technologies .
