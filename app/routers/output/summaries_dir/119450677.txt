in this work , we investigate how the presence of initial entanglement affects energy transport in a network . the network have sites dedicated to incoherent input or output of energy and intermediate control sites where initial entanglement can be established . for short times , we found that initial entanglement in the control sites provides a robust efficiency enhancer for energy transport . for longer times , dephasing considerably damps the quantum correlations , and the advantage of having initial entanglement tends to disappear in favor of the well known mechanism of noise - assisted transport . we careful study these two mechanisms in this work , and we believe our findings may be usuful for a better understanding of the relation between nonclassicality and transport , a topic of potential interest for quantum technologies .
