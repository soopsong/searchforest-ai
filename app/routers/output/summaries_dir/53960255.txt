we propose a way to incorporate the effect of a specific class of feedback processes into stochastic thermodynamics . these"maxwell demon"feedbacks do not affect the system energetics but only the energy barriers between the system states ( in a way which depends on the system states ) . they are thus of a purely informational nature . we show that the resulting formalism can be applied to study the thermodynamic effect of a feedback process acting on electron transfers through a junction .
