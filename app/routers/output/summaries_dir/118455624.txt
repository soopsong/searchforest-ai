we address the quantum characterization of photon counters based on transition - edge sensors ( tess ) and present the first experimental tomography of the positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) of a tes . we provide the reliable tomographic reconstruction of the povm elements up to 11 detected photons and m=100 incoming photons , demonstrating that it is a linear detector .
