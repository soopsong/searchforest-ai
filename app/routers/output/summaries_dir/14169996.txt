we consider the effective dynamics obtained by double - passing a far - detuned laser probe through a large atomic spin system . the net result of the atom - field interaction is a type of coherent positive feedback that amplifies the values of selected spin observables . an effective equation of motion for the atomic system is presented , and an approximate 2-parameter model of the dynamics is developed that should provide a viable approach to modeling even the extremely large spin systems , with n>>1 atoms , encountered under typical laboratory conditions . combining the nonlinear dynamics that result from the positive feedback with continuous observation of the atomic spin offers an improvement in quantum parameter estimation . we explore the possibility of reaching the heisenberg uncertainty scaling in atomic magnetometry without the need for any appreciable spin - squeezing by analyzing our system via the quantum cramer - rao inequality . finally , we develop a realistic quantum parameter estimator for atomic magnetometry that is based on a two - parameter family of gaussian states and investigate the performance of this estimator through numerical simulations . in doing so , we identify several issues , such as numerical convergence and the reduction of estimator bias , that must be addressed when incorporating our parameter estimation methods into an actual laboratory setting .
