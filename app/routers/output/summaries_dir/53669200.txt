quantum walks determined by the coin operator on graphs have been intensively studied . the typical examples of coin operator are the grover and fourier matrices . the periodicity of the grover walk is well investigated . however , the corresponding result on the fourier walk is not known . in this paper , we present a necessary condition for the fourier walk on regular graphs to have the finite period . as an application of our result , we show that the fourier walks do not have any finite period for some classes of regular graphs such as complete graphs , cycle graphs with selfloops , and hypercubes .
