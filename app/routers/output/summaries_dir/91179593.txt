quantum uncertainty of laser light limits the sensitivity of gravitational - wave observatories . in the past 30 years , techniques for squeezing the quantum uncertainty as well as for enhancing the gravitational - wave signal with optical resonators were invented . resonators , however , have finite linewidths ; and the high signal frequencies that are produced during the scientifically highly interesting ring - down of astrophysical compact - binary mergers can not be resolved today . here , we propose an optical approach for expanding the detection bandwidth . it uses quantum uncertainty squeezing inside one of the optical resonators , compensating for finite resonators ' linewidths while maintaining the low - frequency sensitivity unchanged . introducing the quantum expander for boosting the sensitivity of future gravitational - wave detectors , we envision it to become a new tool in other cavity - enhanced metrological experiments .
