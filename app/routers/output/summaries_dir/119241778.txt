quantum input - output theory plays a very important role for analyzing the dynamics of quantum systems , especially large - scale quantum networks . as an extension of the input - output formalism of gardiner and collet , we develop a new approach based on the quantum version of the volterra series which can be used to analyze nonlinear quantum input - output dynamics . by this approach , we can ignore the internal dynamics of the quantum input - output system and represent the system dynamics by a series of kernel functions . this approach has the great advantage of modelling weak - nonlinear quantum networks . in our approach , the number of parameters , represented by the kernel functions , used to describe the input - output response of a weak - nonlinear quantum network , increases linearly with the scale of the quantum network , not exponentially as usual . additionally , our approach can be used to formulate the quantum network with both nonlinear and nonconservative components , e.g. , quantum amplifiers , which can not be modelled by the existing methods , such as the hudson - parthasarathy model and the quantum transfer function model . we apply our general method to several examples , including kerr cavities , optomechanical transducers , and a particular coherent feedback system with a nonlinear component and a quantum amplifier in the feedback loop . this approach provides a powerful way to the modelling and control of nonlinear quantum networks .
