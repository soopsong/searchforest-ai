we calculate the normalized second - order correlation function for a system of two tunnel - coupled photonic resonators , each one exhibiting a single - photon nonlinearity of the kerr type . we employ a full quantum formulation : the master equation for the model , which takes into account both a coherent continuous drive and radiative as well as non - radiative dissipation channels , is solved analytically in steady state through a perturbative approach , and the results are compared to exact numerical simulations . the degree of second - order coherence displays values between 0 and 1 , and divides the diagram identified by the two energy scales of the system - the tunneling and the nonlinear kerr interaction - into two distinct regions separated by a crossover . when the tunneling term dominates over the nonlinear one , the system state is delocalized over both cavities and the emitted light is coherent . in the opposite limit , photon blockade sets in and the system shows an insulator - like state with photons locked on each cavity , identified by antibunching of emitted light .
