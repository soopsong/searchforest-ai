we investigate the possibility that a background independent quantum theory of gravity is not a theory of quantum geometry . we provide a way for global spacetime symmetries to emerge from a background independent theory without geometry . in this , we use a quantum information theoretic formulation of quantum gravity and the method of noiseless subsystems in quantum error correction . this is also a method that can extract particles from a quantum geometric theory such as a spin foam model .
