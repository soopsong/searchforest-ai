we present a stochastic path integral formalism for continuous quantum measurement that enables the analysis of rare events using action methods . by doubling the quantum state space to a canonical phase space , we can write the joint probability density function of measurement outcomes and quantum state trajectories as a phase space path integral . extremizing this action produces the most - likely paths with boundary conditions defined by preselected and postselected states as solutions to a set of ordinary differential equations . as an application , we analyze continuous qubit measurement in detail and examine the structure of a quantum jump in the zeno measurement regime .
