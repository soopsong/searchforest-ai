this article presents a full operator analytical method for studying the quadratic nonlinear interactions in quantum optomechanics . the method is based on the application of higher - order operators , using a six - dimensional basis of second order operators which constitute an exactly closed commutators . we consider both types of standard position - field and the recently predicted non - standard momentum - field quadratic interactions , which is significant when the ratio of mechanical frequency to optical frequency is not negligible . this unexplored regime of large mechanical frequency can be investigated in few platforms including the superconducting electromechanics and simulating quantum cavity electrodynamic circuits . it has been shown that the existence of non - standard quadratic interaction could be observable under appropriate conditions .
