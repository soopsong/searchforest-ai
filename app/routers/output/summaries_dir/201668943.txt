measurement incompatibility describes two or more quantum measurements whose expected joint outcome on a given system can not be defined . this purely non - classical phenomenon provides a necessary ingredient in many quantum information tasks such violating a bell inequality or nonlocally steering part of an entangled state . in this paper , we characterize incompatibility in terms of programmable measurement devices and the general notion of quantum programmability . this refers to the temporal freedom a user has in issuing programs to a quantum device . for devices with a classical control and classical output , measurement incompatibility emerges as the essential quantum resource embodied in their functioning . based on the processing of programmable measurement devices , we construct a quantum resource theory of incompatibility . a complete set of convertibility conditions for programmable devices is derived based on quantum state discrimination with post - measurement information .
