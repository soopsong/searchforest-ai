we prove that in bosonic quantum mechanics the two - point spectral form factor can be obtained as an average of the two - point out - of - time ordered correlation function , with the average taken over the heisenberg group . in quantum field theory , there is an analogous result with the average taken over the tensor product of many copies of the heisenberg group , one copy for each field mode . the resulting formula is expressed as a path integral over two fields , providing a promising approach to the computation of the spectral form factor . we develop the formula that we have obtained using a coherent state description from the jc model and also in the context of the large-$n$ limit of cft and yang - mills theory from the large-$n$ matrix quantum mechanics .
