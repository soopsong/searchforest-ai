we study how quantum walks can be used to find structural anomalies in graphs via several examples . two of our examples are based on star graphs , graphs with a single central vertex to which the other vertices , which we call external vertices , are connected by edges . in the basic star graph , these are the only edges . if we now connect a subset of the external vertices to form a complete subgraph , a quantum walk can be used to find these vertices with a quantum speedup . thus , under some circumstances , a quantum walk can be used to locate where the connectivity of a network changes . we also look at the case of two stars connected at one of their external vertices . a quantum walk can find the vertex shared by both graphs , again with a quantum speedup . this provides an example of using a quantum walk in order to find where two networks are connected . finally , we use a quantum walk on a complete bipartite graph to find an extra edge that destroys the bipartite nature of the graph .
