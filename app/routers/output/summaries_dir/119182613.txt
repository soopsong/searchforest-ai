we study effective light - matter interactions in a circuit qed system consisting of a single $ lc$ resonator , which is coupled symmetrically to multiple superconducting qubits . starting from a minimal circuit model , we demonstrate that in addition to the usual collective qubit - photon coupling the resulting hamiltonian contains direct qubit - qubit interactions , which have a drastic effect on the ground and excited state properties of such circuits in the ultrastrong coupling regime . in contrast to a superradiant phase transition expected from the standard dicke model , we find an opposite mechanism , which at very strong interactions completely decouples the photon mode and projects the qubits into a highly entangled ground state . these findings resolve previous controversies over the existence of superradiant phases in circuit qed , but they more generally show that the physics of two- or multi - atom cavity qed settings can differ significantly from what is commonly assumed .
