this paper is concerned with coherent quantum control design for translation invariant networks of identical quantum stochastic systems subjected to external quantum noise . the network is modelled as an open quantum harmonic oscillator and is governed by a set of linear quantum stochastic differential equations . the dynamic variables of this quantum plant satisfy the canonical commutation relations . similar large - scale systems can be found , for example , in quantum metamaterials and optical lattices . the problem under consideration is to design a stabilizing decentralized coherent quantum controller in the form of another translation invariant quantum system , directly coupled to the plant , so as to minimize a weighted mean square functional of the dynamic variables of the interconnected networks . we consider this problem in the thermodynamic limit of infinite network size and present first - order necessary conditions for optimality of the controller .
