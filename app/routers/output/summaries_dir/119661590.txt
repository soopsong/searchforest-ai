we give a concrete description of a controlled quantum stochastic dynamical model corresponding to a quantum system ( a cavity mode ) under going continual quadrature measurements , with a pid controller acting on the filtered estimate for the mode operator . central use is made of the input and output pictures when constructing the model : these unitarily equivalent pictures are presented in the paper , and used to transfer concepts relating to the controlled internal dynamics to those relating to measurement output , and vice versa . the approach shows the general principle for investigating mathematically and physically consistent models in which standard control theoretic methods are to be extended to the quantum setting .
