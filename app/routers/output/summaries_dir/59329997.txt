a discrete parity $ \mathbb{z}_2 $ symmetry of a two parameter extension of the quantum rabi model which smoothly interpolates between the latter and the jaynes - cummings model , and of the two - photon and the two - mode quantum rabi models enables their diagonalization in the spin subspace . a more general statement is that the respective sets of $ 2\times 2 $ hermitian operators of the fulton - gouterman type and those diagonal in the spin subspace are unitary equivalent . the diagonalized representation makes it transparent that any question about integrability and solvability can be addressed only at the level of ordinary differential operators of dunkl type . braak 's definition of integrability is shown ( i ) to contradict earlier numerical studies and ( ii ) to imply that any physically reasonable differential operator of fulton - gouterman type is integrable .
