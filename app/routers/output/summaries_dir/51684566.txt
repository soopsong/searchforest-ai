a crucial limit to measurement efficiencies of superconducting circuits comes from losses involved when coupling to an external quantum amplifier . here , we realize a device circumventing this problem by directly embedding a two - level artificial atom , comprised of a transmon qubit , within a flux - pumped josephson parametric amplifier . surprisingly , this configuration is able to enhance dispersive measurement without exposing the qubit to appreciable excess backaction . this is accomplished by engineering the circuit to permit high - power operation that reduces information loss to unmonitored channels associated with the amplification and squeezing of quantum noise . by mitigating the effects of off - chip losses downstream , the on - chip gain of this device produces end - to - end measurement efficiencies of up to 80 percent . our theoretical model accurately describes the observed interplay of gain and measurement backaction , and delineates the parameter space for future improvement . the device is compatible with standard fabrication and measurement techniques , and thus provides a route for definitive investigations of fundamental quantum effects and quantum control protocols .
