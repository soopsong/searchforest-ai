the general stable quantum memory unit is a hybrid consisting of a classical digit with a quantum digit ( qudit ) assigned to each classical state . the shape of the memory is the vector of sizes of these qudits , which may differ . we determine when n copies of a quantum memory a embed in n(1+o(1 ) ) copies of another quantum memory b. this relationship captures the notion that b is as at least as useful as a for all purposes in the bulk limit . we show that the embeddings exist if and only if for all p>= 1 , the p - norm of the shape of a does not exceed the p - norm of the shape of b. the log of the p - norm of the shape of a can be interpreted as the maximum of s(\rho ) + h(\rho)/p ( quantum entropy plus discounted classical entropy ) taken over all mixed states \rho on a. we also establish a noiseless coding theorem that justifies these entropies . the noiseless coding theorem and the bulk embedding theorem together say that either a blindly bulk - encodes into b with perfect fidelity , or a admits a state that does not visibly bulk - encode into b with high fidelity . in conclusion , the utility of a hybrid quantum memory is determined by its simultaneous capacity for classical and quantum entropy , which is not a finite list of numbers , but rather a convex region in the classical - quantum entropy plane .
