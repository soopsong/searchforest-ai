one of the central challenges in the development of parametric amplifiers is the control of the dynamic range relative to its gain and bandwidth , which typically limits quantum limited amplification to signals which contain only a few photons per inverse bandwidth . here , we discuss the control of the dynamic range of josephson parametric amplifiers by using josephson junction arrays . we discuss gain , bandwidth , noise , and dynamic range properties of both a transmission line and a lumped element based parametric amplifier . based on these investigations we derive useful design criteria , which may find broad application in the development of practical parametric amplifiers .
