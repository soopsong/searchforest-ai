the rabi model describes the simplest interaction between a cavity mode with a frequency $ \omega_c$ and a two - level system with a resonance frequency $ \omega_0$. it is shown here that the spectrum of the rabi model coincides with the support of the discrete stieltjes integral measure in the orthogonality relations of recently introduced orthogonal polynomials . the exactly solvable limit of the rabi model corresponding to $ \delta=\omega_0/(2\omega_c)=0 $ , which describes a displaced harmonic oscillator , is characterized by the discrete charlier polynomials in normalized energy $ \upepsilon$ , which are orthogonal on an equidistant lattice . a non - zero value of $ \delta$ leads to non - classical discrete orthogonal polynomials $ \phi_{k}(\upepsilon)$ and induces a deformation of the underlying equidistant lattice . the results provide a basis for a novel analytic method of solving the rabi model . the number of ca . { \em 1350 } calculable energy levels per parity subspace obtained in double precision ( cca 16 digits ) by an elementary stepping algorithm is up to two orders of magnitude higher than is possible to obtain by braak 's solution . any first $ n$ eigenvalues of the rabi model arranged in increasing order can be determined as zeros of $ \phi_{n}(\upepsilon)$ of at least the degree $ n = n+n_t$. the value of $ n_t>0 $ , which is slowly increasing with $ n$ , depends on the required precision . for instance , $ n_t\simeq 26 $ for $ n=1000 $ and dimensionless interaction constant $ \kappa=0.2 $ , if double precision is required . although we can rigorously prove our results only for dimensionless interaction constant $ \kappa<1 $ , numerics and exactly solvable example suggest that the main conclusions remain to be valid also for $ \kappa\ge 1$.
