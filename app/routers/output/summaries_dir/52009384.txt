kak 's three - stage protocol for quantum key distribution is revisited with special focus on its hitherto unknown strengths and weaknesses . it is shown that this protocol can be used for secure direct quantum communication . further , the implementability of this protocol in the realistic situation is analyzed by considering various markovian noise models . it is found that the kak 's protocol and its variants in their original form can be implemented only in a restricted class of noisy channels , where the protocols can be transformed to corresponding protocols based on logical qubits in decoherence free subspace . specifically , it is observed that kak 's protocol can be implemented in the presence of collective rotation and collective dephasing noise , but can not be implemented in its original form in the presence of other types of noise , like amplitude damping and phase damping noise . further , the performance of the protocol in the noisy environment is quantified by computing average fidelity under various noise models , and subsequently a set of preferred states for secure communication in noisy environment have also been identified .
