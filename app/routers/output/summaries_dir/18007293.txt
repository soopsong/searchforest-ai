the paper is devoted to systematic study of the $ \chi$-capacity ( underlying the classical capacity ) of infinite dimensional quantum channels . an essential feature of this case is the natural appearance of the input constraints and infinite , in general , ` ` continuous ' ' state ensembles , defined as probability measures on the set of all quantum states . by using compactness criteria from probability theory and operator theory it is shown that the set of all generalized ensembles with the average ( barycenter ) in a compact set of states is itself a compact subset of the set of all probability measures . with this in hand we give a sufficient condition for the existence of an optimal generalized ensemble for a constrained quantum channel . this condition can be verified in the case of bosonic gaussian channels with constrained mean energy . the importance of the above condition is shown by considering example of a constrained channel with no optimal generalized ensemble . in the case of convex constraints a characterization of the optimal generalized ensemble is obtained extending the ` ` maximal distance ' ' property .
