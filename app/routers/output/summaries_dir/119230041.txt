an integrated optical dipole trap uses two - color ( red and blue - detuned ) traveling evanescent wave fields for trapping cold neutral atoms . to achieve longitudinal confinement , we propose using an integrated optical waveguide coupler , which provides a potential gradient along the beam propagation direction sufficient to confine atoms . this integrated optical dipole trap can support an atomic ensemble with a large optical depth due to its small mode area . its quasi - te0 waveguide mode has an advantage over the he11 mode of a nanofiber , with little inhomogeneous zeeman broadening at the trapping region . the longitudinal confinement eliminates the need for a 1-d optical lattice , reducing collisional blockaded atomic loading , potentially producing larger ensembles . the waveguide trap allows for scalability and integrability with nano - fabrication technology . we analyze the potential performance of such integrated atom traps .
