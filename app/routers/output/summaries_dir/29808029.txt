we present a versatile , high - brightness , guided - wave source of polarization entangled photons , emitted at a telecom wavelength . photon - pairs are generated using an integrated type-0 nonlinear waveguide , and subsequently prepared in a polarization entangled state via a stabilized fiber interferometer . we show that the single photon emission wavelength can be tuned over more than 50 nm , whereas the single photon spectral bandwidth can be chosen at will over more than five orders of magnitude ( from 25 mhz to 4 thz ) . moreover , by performing entanglement analysis , we demonstrate a high degree of control of the quantum state via the violation of the bell inequalities by more than 40 standard deviations . this makes this scheme suitable for a wide range of quantum optics experiments , ranging from fundamental research to quantum information applications . we report on details of the setup , as well as on the characterization of all included components , previously outlined in f. kaiser et al . ( 2013 laser phys . lett . 10 , 045202 ) .
