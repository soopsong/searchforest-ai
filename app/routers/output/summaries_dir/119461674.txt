we investigate a non - adiabatic holonomic operation that enables us to entangle two fixed - frequency superconducting transmon qubits attached to a common bus resonator . two coherent microwave tones are applied simultaneously to the two qubits and drive transitions between the first excited resonator state and the second excited state of each qubit . the cyclic evolution within this effective 3-level $ \lambda$-system gives rise to a holonomic operation entangling the two qubits . two - qubit states with 95\% fidelity , limited mainly by charge - noise of the current device , are created within $ 213~\rm{ns}$. this scheme is a step toward implementing a swap - type gate directly in an all - microwave controlled hardware platform . by extending the available set of two - qubit operations in the fixed - frequency qubit architecture , the proposed scheme may find applications in near - term quantum applications using variational algorithms to efficiently create problem - specific trial states .
