in this work , we experimentally manipulate the spectrum and phase of a biphoton wave packet in a two - dimensional frequency space . the spectrum is shaped by adjusting the temperature of the crystal , and the phase is controlled by tilting the dispersive glass plate . the manipulating effects are confirmed by measuring the two - photon spectral intensity ( tsi ) and the hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interference patterns . unlike the previous independent manipulation schemes , here we perform joint manipulation on the biphoton spectrum . the technique in this work paves the way for arbitrary shaping of a multi - photon wave packet in a quantum manner .
