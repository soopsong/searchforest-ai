the hanbury brown - twiss ( hbt ) effect , at the quantum level , is essentially an interference of one particle with another , as opposed to interference of a particle with itself . conventional treatments of identical particles encounter difficulties while dealing with entanglement . a recently introduced label - free approach to indistinguishable particles is described , and is used to analyze the hbt effect . quantum wave - packets have been used to provide a better understanding of the quantum interpretation of the hbt effect . the effect is demonstrated for two independent particles governed by bose - einstein or fermi - dirac statistics . the hbt effect is also analyzed for pairs of entangled particles . surprisingly , entanglement has almost no effect on the interference seen in the hbt effect . in the light of the results , an old quantum optics experiment is reanalyzed , and it is argued that the interference seen in that experiment is not a consequence of non - local correlations between the photons , as is commonly believed .
