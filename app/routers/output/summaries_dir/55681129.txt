architectures based on waveguide quantum electrodynamics have emerged as promising candidates for quantum networks . in this paper , we analyze the propagation of single - photons in disordered many - atom waveguides . we pay special attention to the influence of chirality ( directionality of photon transport ) on the formation of localized photonic states , considering separately the cases of the disorder in the atomic positions and in the atomic transition frequencies .
