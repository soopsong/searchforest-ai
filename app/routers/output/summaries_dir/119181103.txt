we study instant conformal symmetry breaking as a holographic effect of ultrarelativistic particles moving in the ads3 spacetime . we give the qualitative picture of this effect probing it by two - point correlation functions and the entanglement entropy of the corresponding boundary theory . we show that within geodesic approximation the ultra - relativistic massless defect due to gravitational lensing of the geodesics , produces a zone structure for correlators with broken conformal invariance . meanwhile , the holographic entanglement entropy also exhibits a transition to the non - conformal behaviour . two colliding massless defects produce more diverse zone structure for correlators and the entanglement entropy .
