among the objectives toward large - scale quantum computation is the quantum interconnect : a device which uses photons to interface qubits that otherwise could not interact . however , current approaches require photons indistinguishable in frequency --- a major challenge for systems experiencing different local environments or of different physical compositions altogether . here we develop an entirely new platform which actually exploits such frequency mismatch for processing quantum information . labeled"spectral linear optical quantum computation"(spectral loqc ) , our protocol offers favorable linear scaling of optical resources and enjoys an unprecedented degree of parallelism , as an arbitrary $ n$-qubit quantum gate may be performed in parallel on multiple $ n$-qubit sets in the same linear optical device . not only does spectral loqc offer new potential for optical interconnects ; it also brings the ubiquitous technology of high - speed fiber optics to bear on photonic quantum information , making wavelength - configurable and robust optical quantum systems within reach .
