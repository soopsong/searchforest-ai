a quantum thermodynamic cycle with a chiral multiferroic working substance such as $ \textrm{licu}_{2}\textrm{o}_{2}$ is presented . shortcuts to adiabaticity are employed to achieve an efficient , finite time quantum thermodynamic cycle which is found to depend on the spin ordering . the emergent electric polarization associated with the chiral spin order , i.e. the magnetoelectric coupling , renders possible steering of the spin order by an external electric field and hence renders possible an electric - field control of the cycle . due to the intrinsic coupling between of the spin and the electric polarization , the cycle performs an electro - magnetic work . we determine this work 's mean square fluctuations , the irreversible work , and the output power of the cycle . we observe that the work mean square fluctuations are increased with the duration of the adiabatic strokes while the irreversible work and the output power of the cycle show a non - monotonic behavior . in particular the irreversible work vanishes at the end of the quantum adiabatic strokes . this fact confirms that the cycle is reversible . our theoretical findings evidence the existence of a system inherent maximal output power . by implementing a lindblad master equation we quantify the role of thermal relaxations on the cycle efficiency . we also discuss the role of entanglement encoded in the non - collinear spin order as a resource to affect the quantum thermodynamic cycle .
