we explore the relation between memcomputing , namely computing with and in memory , and swarm intelligence algorithms . in particular , we show that one can design memristive networks to solve short - path optimization problems that can also be solved by ant - colony algorithms . by employing appropriate memristive elements one can demonstrate an almost one - to - one correspondence between memcomputing and ant colony optimization approaches . however , the memristive network has the capability of finding the solution in one deterministic step , compared to the stochastic multi - step ant colony optimization . this result paves the way for nanoscale hardware implementations of several swarm intelligence algorithms that are presently explored , from scheduling problems to robotics .
