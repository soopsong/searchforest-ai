the self - kerr interaction is an optical nonlinearity that produces a phase shift proportional to the square of the number of photons in the field . at present , many proposals use nonlinearities to generate photon - photon interactions . for propagating fields these interactions result in undesirable features such as spectral correlation between the photons . here , we engineer a discrete network composed of cross - kerr interaction regions to simulate a self - kerr medium . the medium has effective long - range interactions implemented in a physically local way . we compute the one- and two - photon s matrices for fields propagating in this medium . from these scattering matrices we show that our proposal leads to a high fidelity photon - photon gate . in the limit where the number of nodes in the network tends to infinity , the medium approximates a perfect self - kerr interaction in the one- and two - photon regime .
