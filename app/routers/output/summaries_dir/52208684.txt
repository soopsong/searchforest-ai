intrinsic defects in optomechanical devices are generally viewed to be detrimental for achieving coherent amplification of phonons , and great care has thus been exercised in fabricating devices and materials with no ( or a minimal number of ) defects . contrary to this view , here we show that , by surpassing an exceptional point ( ep ) , both the mechanical gain and the phonon number can be enhanced despite increasing defect losses . this counterintuitive effect , well described by an effective non - hermitian phonon - defect model , provides a mechanical analog of the loss - induced purely optical lasing . this opens the way to operating random - defect phonon devices at eps .
