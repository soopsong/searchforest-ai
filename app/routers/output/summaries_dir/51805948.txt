the nonadiabatic entropy production is a useful tool for the thermodynamic analysis of continuously dissipating , nonequilibrium steady states . for open quantum systems , two seemingly distinct definitions for the nonadiabatic entropy production have appeared in the literature , one based on the quantum relative entropy and the other based on quantum trajectories . we show that these two formulations are equivalent . furthermore , this equivalence leads us to a proof of the monotonicity of the quantum relative entropy under a special class of completely - positive , trace - preserving quantum maps , which circumvents difficulties associated with the noncommuntative structure of operators .
