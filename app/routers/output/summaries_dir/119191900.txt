we perform the fidelity analysis for boltzmann - gibbs - like states in order to investigate whether the topological order of 1d fermionic systems at zero temperature is maintained at finite temperatures . we use quantum walk protocols that are known to simulate topological phases and the respective quantum phase transitions for chiral symmetric hamiltonians . using the standard approaches of the fidelity analysis and the study of edge states , we conclude that no thermal - like phase transitions occur as temperature increases , i.e. , the topological behaviour is washed out gradually . we also show that the behaviour of the uhlmann geometric factor associated to the considered fidelity exhibits the same behaviour as the latter , thus confirming the results obtained using the previously established approaches .
