in [ phys . rev . a 70 , 062101 ( 2004 ) ] gibbons et al . defined a class of discrete wigner functions w to represent quantum states in a finite hilbert space dimension d. i characterize a set c_d of states having non - negative w simultaneously in all definitions of w in this class . for d<6 i show c_d is the convex hull of stabilizer states . this supports the conjecture that negativity of w is necessary for exponential speedup in pure - state quantum computation .
