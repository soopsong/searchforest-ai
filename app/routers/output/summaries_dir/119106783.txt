we prove feasibility of high - fidelity pulsed optomechanical interface based on all - optical presqueezing of non - gaussian quantum states of light before they enter the optomechanical system . we demonstrate that feasible presqueezing of optical states effectively increases the low noise transfer of them to mechanical oscillator . it allows one to surpass the limit necessary to transfer highly nonclassical states with negative wigner function . in particular , we verify that with this help single photon states of light can be efficiently turned to single phonon states of mechanical oscillator , keeping the negativity of the wigner function . it opens the possibility to merge quantum optomechanics with the recent methods of quantum optics .
