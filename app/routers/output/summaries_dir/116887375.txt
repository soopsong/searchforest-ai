we present a systematic entanglement concentration protocol ( ecp ) for an arbitrary unknown less - entangled three - photon w state , resorting to the optical property of the quantum - dot spins inside one - sided optical microcavities . in our ecp , the parties obtain not only some three - photon systems in the partially entangled with two unknown parameters when one of the parties picks up the robust odd - parity instance with the parity - check gate ( pcg ) on his two photons , but also some entangled two - photon systems by keeping the even - parity instance in the first step . by exploiting the above three - photon and two - photon systems with the same parameters as the resource for the second step of our ecp , the parties can obtain a standard three - photon w state by keeping the robust odd - parity instance . meanwhile , the systems in the even - parity instance can be used as the resource in the next round of our ecp . the success probability of our ecp is largely increased by iteration of the ecp process . as it does require that all the coefficients are unknown for the parties , our ecp maybe have good applications in quantum communication network in future .
