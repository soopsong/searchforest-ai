quantum entanglement in mechanical systems is not only a key signature of macroscopic quantum effects , but has wide applications in quantum technologies . here we proposed an effective approach for creating strong steady - state entanglement between two directly coupled mechanical oscillators ( or a mechanical oscillator and a microwave resonator ) in a modulated optomechanical system . the entanglement is achieved by combining the processes of a cavity cooling and the two - mode parametric interaction , which can surpass the bound on the maximal stationary entanglement from the two - mode parametric interaction . in principle , our proposal allows one to cool the system from an initial thermal state to an entangled state with high purity by a monochromatic driving laser . also , the obtained entangled state can be used to implement the continuous - variable teleportation with high fidelity . moreover , our proposal is robust against the thermal fluctuations of the mechanical modes under the condition of strong optical pumping .
