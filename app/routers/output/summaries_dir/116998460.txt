we analyze a chain of coupled nonlinear optical cavities driven by a coherent source of light localized at one end and subject to uniform dissipation . we characterize photon transport by studying the populations and the photon correlations as a function of position . when complemented with input - output theory , these quantities provide direct information about photon transmission through the system . the position of single- and multi - photon resonances directly reflect the structure of the many - body energy levels . this shows how a study of transport along a coupled cavity array can provide rich information about the strongly correlated ( many - body ) states of light even in presence of dissipation . by means of a numerical algorithm based on the time - evolving block decimation scheme adapted to mixed states , we are able to simulate arrays up to sixty cavities .
