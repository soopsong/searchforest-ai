we construct families of high performance quantum amplitude damping codes . all of our codes are nonadditive and most modestly outperform the best possible additive codes in terms of encoded dimension . one family is built from nonlinear error - correcting codes for classical asymmetric channels , with which we systematically construct quantum amplitude damping codes with parameters better than any prior construction known for any block length n>7 except n=2^r-1 . we generalize this construction to employ classical codes over gf(3 ) with which we numerically obtain better performing codes up to length 14 . because the resulting codes are of the codeword stabilized ( cws ) type , easy encoding and decoding circuits are available .
