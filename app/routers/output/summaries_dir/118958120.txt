we employ phase - sensitive amplification to perform homodyne detection of the resonance fluorescence from a driven superconducting artificial atom . entanglement between the emitter and its fluorescence allows us to track the individual quantum state trajectories of the emitter conditioned on the outcomes of the field measurements . we analyze the ensemble properties of these trajectories by considering trajectories that connect specific initial and final states . by applying the stochastic path integral formalism , we calculate equations - of - motion for the most likely path between two quantum states and compare these predicted paths to experimental data . drawing on the mathematical similarity between the action formalism of the most likely quantum paths and ray optics we study the emergence of caustics in quantum trajectories --- places where multiple extrema in the stochastic action occur . we observe such multiple most likely paths in experimental data and find these paths to be in reasonable quantitative agreement with theoretical calculations .
