light experiences dielectric matter as an effective gravitational field and matter experiences light as a form of gravity as well . light and matter waves see each other as dual space - time metrics , thus establishing a unique model in field theory . actio et reactio are governed by abraham 's energy - momentum tensor and equations of state for quantum dielectrics .
