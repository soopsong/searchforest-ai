high - dimensional quantum entanglement can enrich the functionality of quantum information processing . for example , it can enhance the channel capacity for linear optic superdense coding and decrease the error rate threshold of quantum key distribution . long - distance distribution of a high - dimensional entanglement is essential for such advanced quantum communications over a communications network . here , we show a long - distance distribution of a four - dimensional entanglement . we employ time - bin entanglement , which is suitable for a fibre transmission , and implement scalable measurements for the high - dimensional entanglement using cascaded mach - zehnder interferometers . we observe that a pair of time - bin entangled photons has more than 1 bit of secure information capacity over 100 km . our work constitutes an important step towards secure and dense quantum communications in a large hilbert space .
