exploiting the intrinsic nonlinearity of superconducting josephson junctions , we propose a scalable circuit with superconducting qubits ( scqs ) which is very similar to the successful one now being used for trapped ions . the scqs are coupled to the"vibrational"mode provided by a superconducting lc circuit or its equivalent ( e.g. , a squid ) . both single - qubit rotations and qubit - lc - circuit couplings / decouplings can be controlled by the frequencies of the time - dependent magnetic fluxes . the circuit is scalable since the qubit - qubit interactions , mediated by the lc circuit , can be selectively performed , and the information transfer can be realized in a controllable way .
