we propose methods to perform intensity interferometry of photons having two different wavelengths . distinguishable particles typically can not interfere with each other , but we overcome that obstacle by processing the particles via entanglement and projection so that they lead to the same final state at the detection apparatus . specifically , we discuss how quasi - phase - matched nonlinear crystals can be used to convert a quantum superposition of light of different wavelengths onto a common wavelength , while preserving the phase information essential for their meaningful interference . we thereby gain access to a host of new observables , which can probe subtle frequency correlations and entanglement . further , we generalize the van cittert - zernike formula for the intensity interferometry of extended sources , demonstrate how our proposal supports enhanced resolution of sources with different spectral character , and suggest potential applications .
