there is a remarkable characteristic of photosynthesis in nature , that is , the energy transfer efficiency is close to 100 % . recently , due to the rapid progress made in the experimental techniques , quantum coherent effects have been experimentally demonstrated . traditionally , the incoherent theories are capable of calculating the energy transfer efficiency , e.g. , ( generalized ) f\"orster theory and modified redfield theory . however , in order to describe the quantum coherent effects in photosynthesis , the coherent theories have been developed , such as hierarchical equation of motion , quantum path integral , coherent modified redfield theory , small - polaron quantum master equation , and general bloch - redfield theory in addition to the redfield theory . here , we summarize the main points of the above approaches , which might be beneficial to the quantum simulation of quantum dynamics of exciton energy transfer in natural photosynthesis , and shed light on the design of artificial light - harvesting devices .
