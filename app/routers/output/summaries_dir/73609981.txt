we introduce a new type of discrete quantum walks , called vertex - face walks , based on orientable embeddings . we first establish a spectral correspondence between the transition matrix $ u$ and the vertex - face incidence structure . using the incidence graph , we derive a formula for the principal logarithm of $ u^2 $ , and find conditions for its underlying digraph to be an oriented graph . in particular , we show this happens if the vertex - face incidence structure forms a partial geometric design . we also explore properties of vertex - face walks on the covers of a graph . finally , we study a non - classical behavior of vertex - face walks .
