strongly coupled quantum dot - cavity systems provide a non - linear configuration of hybridized light - matter states with promising quantum - optical applications . here , we investigate the coherent interaction between strong laser pulses and quantum dot - cavity polaritons . resonant excitation of polaritonic states and their interaction with phonons allow us to observe coherent rabi oscillations and ramsey fringes . furthermore , we demonstrate complete coherent control of a quantum dot - photonic crystal cavity based quantum - bit . by controlling the excitation power and phase in a two - pulse excitation scheme we achieve access to the full bloch sphere . quantum - optical simulations are in good agreement with our experiments and provide insight into the decoherence mechanisms .
