recent progress in resource theory of quantum coherence has resulted in measures to quantify coherence in quantum systems . especially , the l1-norm and relative entropy of coherence have been shown to be proper quantifiers of coherence and have been used to investigate coherence properties in different operational tasks . since long - lasting quantum coherence has been experimentally confirmed in a number of photosynthetic complexes , it has been debated if and how coherence is connected to the known efficiency of population transfer in such systems . in this study , we investigate quantitatively the relationship between coherence , as quantified by l1-norm and relative entropy of coherence , and efficiency , as quantified by fidelity , for population transfer between end - sites in a network of two - level quantum systems . in particular , we use the coherence averaged over the duration of the population transfer in order to carry out a quantitative comparision between coherence and fidelity . our results show that although coherence is a necessary requirement for population transfer , there is no unique relation between coherence and the efficiency of the transfer process .
