quantum computation in the one - way model requires the preparation of certain resource states known as cluster states . we describe how the construction of continuous - variable cluster states for optical quantum computing relate to the existence of certain families of matrices . the relevant matrices are known as weighing matrices , with a few additional constraints . we prove some results regarding the structure of these matrices , and their associated graphs .
