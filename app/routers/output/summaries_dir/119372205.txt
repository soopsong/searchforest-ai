we propose an alignment - free two - party polarization - entanglement transmission scheme for entangled photons by using only linear - optical elements , requiring neither ancillary photons nor calibrated reference frames . the scheme is robust against both the random channel noise and the instability of reference frames , and it is subsequently extended to multi - party greenberger - horne - zeilinger state transmission . furthermore , the success probabilities for two- and multi - party entanglement transmission are , in principle , improved to unity when active polarization controllers are used . the distinct characters of a simple structure , easy to be implemented , and a high fidelity and efficiency make our protocol very useful for long - distance quantum communications and distributed quantum networks in practical applications .
