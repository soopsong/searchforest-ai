we address the optimal covariance steering ( ocs ) problem for stochastic discrete linear systems with additive gaussian noise under state chance constraints and input hard constraints . because the system state can be unbounded due to the unbounded noise , the state constraints are formulated as probabilistic ( chance ) constraints , i.e. , the maximum probability of constraint violation is constrained . in contrast , because it is hard to interpret the appropriate control action when the control command violates the constraints , probabilistically formulating the control constraints are difficult , and deterministic hard constraints are preferable . in this work we introduce an ocs approach subject to simultaneous state chance constraints and input hard constraints and validate the approach using numerical simulations .
