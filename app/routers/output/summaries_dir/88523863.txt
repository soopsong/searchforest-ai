spectrally uncorrelated biphoton state generated from the spontaneous nonlinear optical process is an important resource for quantum information . currently such spectrally uncorrelated biphoton state can only be prepared from limited kinds of nonlinear media , thus limiting their wavelengths . in order to explore wider wavelength range , here we theoretically study the generation of spectrally uncorrelated biphoton state from 14 isomorphs of potassium dihydrogen phosphate ( kdp ) crystal . we find that 11 crystals from the ` kdp family ' still maintain similar nonlinear optical properties of kdp , such as kdp , dkdp , adp , dadp , ada , dada , rda , drda , rdp , drdp and kda , which satisfy 3 kinds of the group - velocity matching conditions for spectrally uncorrelated biphoton state generation from near - infrared to telecom wavelengths . based on the uncorrelated biphoton state , we investigate the generation of heralded pure - state single photon by detecting one member of the biphoton state to herald the output of the other . the purity of the heralded single photon is as high as 0.98 without using a narrow - band filter ; the hong - ou - mandel interference from independent sources can also achieve a visibility of 98 % . this study may provide more and better single - photon sources for quantum information processing at near - infrared and telecom wavelengths .
