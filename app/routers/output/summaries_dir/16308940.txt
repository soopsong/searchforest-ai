we prove that constant - depth quantum circuits are more powerful than their classical counterparts . to this end we introduce a non - oracular version of the bernstein - vazirani problem which we call the 2d hidden linear function problem . an instance of the problem is specified by a quadratic form q that maps n - bit strings to integers modulo four . the goal is to identify a linear boolean function which describes the action of q on a certain subset of n - bit strings . we prove that any classical probabilistic circuit composed of bounded fan - in gates that solves the 2d hidden linear function problem with high probability must have depth logarithmic in n. in contrast , we show that this problem can be solved with certainty by a constant - depth quantum circuit composed of one- and two - qubit gates acting locally on a two - dimensional grid .
