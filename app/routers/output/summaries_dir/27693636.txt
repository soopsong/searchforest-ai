unit - efficiency homodyne detection of the resonance fluorescence of a two - level atom collapses the quantum state of the atom to a stochastically moving point on the bloch sphere . recently , hofmann , mahler , and hess [ phys . rev . a { \bf 57 } , 4877 ( 1998 ) ] showed that by making part of the coherent driving proportional to the homodyne photocurrent can stabilize the state to any point on the bottom half of the sphere . here we reanalyze their proposal using the technique of stochastic master equations , allowing their results to be generalized in two ways . first , we show that any point on the upper or lower half , but not the equator , of the sphere may be stabilized . second , we consider non - unit - efficiency detection , and quantify the effectiveness of the feedback by calculating the maximal purity obtainable in any particular direction in bloch space .
