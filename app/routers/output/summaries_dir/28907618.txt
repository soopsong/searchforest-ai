we present universal continuous variable quantum computation ( cvqc ) in the micromaser . with a brief history as motivation we present the background theory and define universal cvqc . we then show how to generate a set of operations in the micromaser which can be used to achieve universal cvqc . it then follows that the micromaser is a potential architecture for cvqc but our proof is easily adaptable to other potential physical systems .
