quantum simulators are devices that actively use quantum effects to answer questions about model systems and , through them , real systems . here we expand on this definition by answering several fundamental questions about the nature and use of quantum simulators . our answers address two important areas . first , the difference between an operation termed simulation and another termed computation . this distinction is related to the purpose of an operation , as well as our confidence in and expectation of its accuracy . second , the threshold between quantum and classical simulations . throughout , we provide a perspective on the achievements and directions of the field of quantum simulation .
