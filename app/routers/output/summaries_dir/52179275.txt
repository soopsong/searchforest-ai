in the quantum repeater networks of the quantum internet , the varying stability of entangled quantum links makes dynamic topology adaption an emerging issue . here we define an efficient topology adaption method for quantum repeater networks . the model assumes the random failures of entangled links and several parallel demands from legal users . the shortest path defines a set of entangled links for which the probability of stability is above a critical threshold . the scheme is utilized in a base - graph of the overlay quantum network to provide an efficient shortest path selection for the demands of all users of the network . we study the problem of entanglement assignment in a quantum repeater network , prove its computational complexity , and show an optimization procedure . the results are particularly convenient for future quantum networking , quantum - internet , and experimental long - distance quantum communications .
