suppose that three kinds of quantum systems are given in some unknown states $ \ket f^{\otimes n}$ , $ \ket{g_1}^{\otimes k}$ , and $ \ket{g_2}^{\otimes k}$ , and we want to decide which \textit{template } state $ \ket{g_1}$ or $ \ket{g_2}$ , each representing the feature of the pattern class $ { \cal c}_1 $ or $ { \cal c}_2 $ , respectively , is closest to the input \textit{feature } state $ \ket f$. this is an extension of the pattern matching problem into the quantum domain . assuming that these states are known a priori to belong to a certain parametric family of pure qubit systems , we derive two kinds of matching strategies . the first is a semiclassical strategy which is obtained by the natural extension of conventional matching strategies and consists of a two - stage procedure : identification ( estimation ) of the unknown template states to design the classifier ( \textit{learning } process to train the classifier ) and classification of the input system into the appropriate pattern class based on the estimated results . the other is a fully quantum strategy without any intermediate measurement which we might call as the { \it universal quantum matching machine } . we present the bayes optimal solutions for both strategies in the case of k=1 , showing that there certainly exists a fully quantum matching procedure which is strictly superior to the straightforward semiclassical extension of the conventional matching strategy based on the learning process .
