the design of highly wavelength tunable semiconductor laser structures is presented . the system is based on a one dimensional photonic crystal cavity consisting of two patterned , doubly - clamped nanobeams , otherwise known as a"zipper"cavity . zipper cavities are highly dispersive with respect to the gap between nanobeams in which extremely strong radiation pressure forces exist . schemes for controlling the zipper cavity wavelength both optically and electrically are presented . tuning ranges as high as 75 nm are achieved for a nominal design wavelength of 1.3micron . sensitivity of the mechanically compliant laser structure to thermal noise is considered , and it is found that dynamic back - action of radiation pressure in the form of an optical or electrical spring can be used to stabilize the laser frequency . fabrication of zipper cavity laser structures in gaas material with embedded self - assembled inas quantum dots is presented , along with measurements of photoluminescence spectroscopy of the zipper cavity modes .
