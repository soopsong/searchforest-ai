the characterization of quantum processes , e.g. communication channels , is an essential ingredient for establishing quantum information systems . for quantum key distribution protocols , the amount of overall noise in the channel determines the rate at which secret bits are distributed between authorized partners . in particular , tomographic protocols allow for the full reconstruction , and thus characterization , of the channel . here , we perform quantum process tomography of high - dimensional quantum communication channels with dimensions ranging from 2 to 5 . we can thus explicitly demonstrate the effect of an eavesdropper performing an optimal cloning attack or an intercept - resend attack during a quantum cryptographic protocol . moreover , our study shows that quantum process tomography enables a more detailed understanding of the channel conditions compared to a coarse - grained measure , such as quantum bit error rates . this full characterization technique allows us to optimize the performance of quantum key distribution under asymmetric experimental conditions , which is particularly useful when considering high - dimensional encoding schemes .
