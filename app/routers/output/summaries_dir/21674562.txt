in the previous paper [ m. tsang , phys . rev . a 81 , 063837 ( 2010 ) , e - print arxiv:1003.0116 ] , i proposed a quantum model of a cavity electro - optic modulator , which can coherently couple an optical cavity mode to a microwave resonator mode and enable novel quantum operations on the two modes , including laser cooling of the microwave mode , electro - optic entanglement , and backaction - evading optical measurement of a microwave quadrature . in this sequel , i focus on the quantum input - output relations between traveling optical and microwave fields coupled to a cavity electro - optic modulator . with red - sideband optical pumping , the relations are shown to resemble those of a beam splitter for the traveling fields , so that in the ideal case of zero parasitic loss and critical coupling , microwave photons can be coherently up - converted to"flying"optical photons with unit efficiency , and vice versa . with blue - sideband pumping , the modulator acts as a nondegenerate parametric amplifier , which can generate two - mode squeezing and hybrid entangled photon pairs at optical and microwave frequencies . these fundamental operations provide a potential bridge between circuit quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics .
