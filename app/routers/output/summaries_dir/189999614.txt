floquet engineering or coherent time periodic driving of quantum systems has been successfully used to synthesize hamiltonians with novel properties . in ultracold atomic systems , this has led to experimental realizations of artificial gauge fields , topological band structures , and observation of dynamical localization , to name just a few . here we present a floquet - based framework to stroboscopically engineer hamiltonians with spatial features and periodicity below the diffraction limit of light used to create them by time - averaging over various configurations of a 1d optical kronig - penney ( kp ) lattice . the kp potential is a lattice of narrow subwavelength barriers spaced by half the optical wavelength ( $ \lambda/2 $ ) and arises from the non - linear optical response of the atomic dark state . stroboscopic control over the strength and position of this lattice requires time - dependent adiabatic manipulation of the dark state spin composition . we investigate adiabaticity requirements and shape our time - dependent light fields to respect the requirements . we apply this framework to show that a $ \lambda/4$-spaced lattice can be synthesized using realistic experimental parameters as an example , discuss mechanisms that limit lifetimes in these lattices , explore candidate systems and their limitations , and treat adiabatic loading into the ground band of these lattices .
