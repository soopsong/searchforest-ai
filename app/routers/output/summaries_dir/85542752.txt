in the mass - polariton ( mp ) theory of light formulated by us recently [ phys . rev . a 95 , 063850 ( 2017 ) ] , light in a medium is described as a coupled state of the field and matter . the key result of the mp theory is that the optical force of light propagating in a transparent material drives forward an atomic mass density wave ( mdw ) . in previous theories , it has been well understood that the medium carries part of the momentum of light . the mp theory is fundamentally different since it shows that this momentum is associated with the mdw that carries a substantial atomic mass density and the related rest energy with light . in this work , we prove the lorentz covariance of the mp theory and show how the stress - energy - momentum ( sem ) tensor of the mp transforms between arbitrary inertial frames . we also compare the mp sem tensor with the conventional minkowski sem tensor and show how the well - known fundamental problems of the minkowski sem tensor become solved by the sem tensor based on the mp theory . we have particularly written our work for non - expert readers by pointing out how the lorentz transformation and various conservation laws and symmetries of the special theory of relativity are fulfilled in the mp theory .
