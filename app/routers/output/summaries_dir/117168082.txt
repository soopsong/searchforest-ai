the simple stationary decoherence of a two - state quantum system is discussed from a new viewpoint of environmental entanglement . my work emphasizes that an unconditional local state must totally be disentangled from the rest of the universe . it has been known for long that the loss of coherence within the given local system is gradual . also the quantum correlations between the local system and the rest of the universe are being destroyed gradually . i show that , differently from local decoherence , the process of environmental disentanglement may terminate in finite time . the time of perfect disentanglement turns out to be on the decoherence time scale , and in a simple case we determine the exact value of it .
