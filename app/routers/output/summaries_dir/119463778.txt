we discuss heat transport in a thermally - biased squid in the presence of an external magnetic flux , when a non - negligible inductance of the squid ring is taken into account . a properly sweeping driving flux causes the thermal current to modulate and behave hysteretically . the response of this device is analysed as a function of both the hysteresis parameter and degree of asymmetry of the squid , highlighting the parameter range over which hysteretic behavior is observable . markedly , also the temperature of the squid shows hysteretic evolution , with sharp transitions characterized by temperature jumps up to , e.g. , ~ 38mk for a realistic al - based setup . in view of these results , the proposed device can effectively find application as a temperature - based superconducting memory element , working even at ghz frequencies by suitably choosing the superconductor on which the device is based .
