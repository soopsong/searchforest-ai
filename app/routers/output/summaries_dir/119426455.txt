semidefinite relaxations are widely used to compute upper bounds on the objective of optimization problems involving noncommutative polynomials . such optimization problems are prevalent in quantum information . we present an algorithm able to discover automatically and exploit the symmetries present in the problem formulation . we also provide an open source software library written in scala ( https://denisrosset.github.io/symdpoly ) that computes symmetry - adapted semidefinite relaxations with interfaces to a variety of open - source and commercial semidefinite solvers . we discuss the advantages of symmetrization , namely reductions in memory use , computation time , and increase in the solution precision .
