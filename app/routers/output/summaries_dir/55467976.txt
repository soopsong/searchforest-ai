we propose the square of convex - roof extended negativity(scren ) as a powerful candidate to characterize strong monogamy of multi - party quantum entanglement . we first provide a strong monogamy inequality of multi - party entanglement using scren , and show that the tangle - based multi - qubit strong monogamy inequality can be rephrased by scren . we further show that scren strong monogamy inequality is still true for the counterexamples that violate tangle - based strong monogamy inequality in higher - dimensional quantum systems rather than qubits . we also analytically show that scren strong monogamy inequality is true for a large class of multi - qudit states , a superposition of multi - qudit generalized w - class states and vacuums . thus scren is a good alternative to characterize the strong monogamy of entanglement even in multi - qudit systems .
