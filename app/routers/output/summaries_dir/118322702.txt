we review the introduction of likelihood functions and fisher information in classical estimation theory , and we show how they can be defined in a very similar manner within quantum measurement theory . we show that the stochastic master equations describing the dynamics of a quantum system subject to a definite set of measurements provides likelihood functions for unknown parameters in the system dynamics , and we show that the estimation error , given by the fisher information , can be identified by stochastic master equation simulations . for large parameter spaces we describe and illustrate the efficient use of markov chain monte carlo sampling of the likelihood function .
