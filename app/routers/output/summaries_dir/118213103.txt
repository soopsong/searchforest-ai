control of quantum dissipative systems can be challenging because control variables are typically part of the system hamiltonian , which can only generate motion along unitary orbits of the system . to transit between orbits , one must harness the dissipation super - operator . to separate the inter - orbit dynamics from the hamiltonian dynamics for a generic two - dimensional system , we project the lindblad master equation onto the set of spectra of the density matrix , and we interpret the location along the orbit to be a new control variable . the resulting differential equation allows us to analyze the controllability of a general two - dimensional lindblad system , particularly systems where the dissipative term has an anti - symmetric part . we extend this to categorize the possible purifiable systems in two dimensions .
