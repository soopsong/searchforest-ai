we demonstrate non - perturbative coupling between a single self - assembled ingaas quantum dot and an external fiber - mirror based microcavity . our results extend the previous realizations of tunable microcavities while ensuring spatial and spectral overlap between the cavity - mode and the emitter by simultaneously allowing for deterministic charge control of the quantum dots . using resonant spectroscopy , we show that the coupled quantum dot cavity system is at the onset of strong coupling , with a cooperativity parameter of 2 . our results constitute a milestone towards the realization of a high efficiency solid - state spin - photon interface .
