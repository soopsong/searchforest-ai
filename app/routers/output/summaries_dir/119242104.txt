one of the most important concepts in non - equilibrium physics is relaxation . in the vicinity of a classical critical point , the relaxation time can diverge and result in a universal power - law for the relaxation dynamics ; the emerging classification of the dynamic universality class has been elucidated by hohenberg and halperin . in this paper , we systematically study the long - time relaxation dynamics in stochastically driven interacting quantum systems . we find that even though the stochastic forces will inevitably drive the systems into a featureless infinite temperature state , the way to approach the steady state can be highly nontrivial and exhibit rich universal dynamical behavior determined by the interplay between the stochastic driving and quantum many - body effects . we investigate the dynamical universality class by including different types of perturbations . the heating dynamics of a hamiltonian with locally unbounded hilbert space is also studied .
