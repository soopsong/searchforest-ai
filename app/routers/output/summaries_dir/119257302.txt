singlet - triplet spin qubits in six - electron double quantum dots , in moderate magnetic fields , can show superior immunity to charge noise . this immunity results from the symmetry of orbitals in the second energy shell of circular quantum dots : singlet and triplet states in this shell have identical charge distributions . our phase - gate simulations , which include $ 1 / f$ charge noise from fluctuating traps , show that this symmetry is most effectively exploited if the gate operation switches rapidly between sweet spots deep in the ( 3,3 ) and ( 4,2 ) charge stability regions ; fidelities very close to one are predicted if subnanosecond switching can be performed .
