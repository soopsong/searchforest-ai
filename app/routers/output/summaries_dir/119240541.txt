we study asymptotically lifshitz spacetimes and the constraints on flows between lifshitz fixed points imposed by the null energy condition . in contrast with the relativistic holographic c - theorem , where the effective ads radius , l , is monotonically decreasing in the ir , for lifshitz backgrounds we find that both l and z may flow in either direction . we demonstrate this with several numerical examples in a phenomenological model with a massive gauge field coupled to a real scalar .
