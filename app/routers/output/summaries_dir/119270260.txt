we experimentally explore the state space of three qubits on an nmr quantum information processor . we construct a scheme to experimentally realize a canonical form for general three - qubit states up to single - qubit unitaries . this form involves a non - trivial combination of ghz and w - type maximally entangled states of three qubits . the general circuit that we have constructed for the generic state reduces to those for ghz and w states as special cases . the experimental construction of a generic state is carried out for a nontrivial set of parameters and the good fidelity of preparation is confirmed by complete state tomography . the ghz and w - states are constructed as special cases of the general experimental scheme . further , we experimentally demonstrate a curious fact about three - qubit states , where for almost all pure states , the two - qubit reduced states can be used to reconstruct the full three - qubit state . for the case of a generic state and for the w - state , we demonstrate this method of reconstruction by comparing it with the directly tomographed three - qubit state .
