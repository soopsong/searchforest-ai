i theoretically study the behavior of strong pulses exciting emitters inside a cavity . the ensemble is supposed to be inhomogeneously broadened and the cavity matched finding application in quantum storage of optical or rf photons . my analysis is based on energy and pulse area conservation rules predicting important distortions for specific areas . it is well supported by numerical simulations . i propose a qualitative interpretation in terms of slow - light . the analogy with the free space situation is remarkable .
