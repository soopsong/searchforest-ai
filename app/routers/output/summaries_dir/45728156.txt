optimally extracting information from measurements performed on a physical system requires an accurate model of the measurement interaction . continuously probing the collective spin of an alkali atom cloud via its interaction with an off - resonant optical probe is an important example of such a measurement where realistic modeling at the quantum level is possible using standard techniques from atomic physics . typically , however , tutorial descriptions of this technique have neglected the multilevel structure of realistic atoms for the sake of simplification . in this paper we account for the full multilevel structure of alkali atoms and derive the irreducible form of the polarizability hamiltonian describing a typical dispersive quantum measurement . for a specific set of parameters , we then show that semiclassical predictions of the theory are consistent with our experimental observations of polarization scattering by a polarized cloud of laser - cooled cesium atoms . we also derive the signal - to - noise ratio under a single measurement trial and use this to predict the rate of spin - squeezing with multilevel alkali atoms for arbitrary detuning of the probe beam .
