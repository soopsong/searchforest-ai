in this paper , we study the concurrence of arbitrary dimensional tripartite quantum systems . an explicit operational lower bound of concurrence is obtained in terms of the concurrence of sub - states . a given example show that our lower bound may improve the well known existing lower bounds of concurrence . the significance of our result is to get a lower bound when we study the concurrence of arbitrary dimensional multipartite quantum systems .
