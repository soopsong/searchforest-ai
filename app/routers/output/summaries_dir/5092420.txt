complex networks are formal frameworks capturing the interdependencies between the elements of large systems and databases . this formalism allows to use network navigation methods to rank the importance that each constituent has on the global organization of the system . a key example is pagerank navigation which is at the core of the most used search engine of the world wide web . inspired in this classical algorithm , we define a quantum navigation method providing a unique ranking of the elements of a network . we analyze the convergence of quantum navigation to the stationary rank of networks and show that quantumness decreases the number of navigation steps before convergence . in addition , we show that quantum navigation allows to solve degeneracies found in classical ranks . by implementing the quantum algorithm in real networks , we confirm these improvements and show that quantum coherence unveils new hierarchical features about the global organization of complex systems .
