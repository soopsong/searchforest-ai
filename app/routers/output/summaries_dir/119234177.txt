a superconducting quantum magnetometer based on magnetic flux - driven modulation of the density of states of a proximized metallic nanowire is theoretically analyzed . with optimized geometrical and material parameters transfer functions up to a few mv / phi_0 and intrinsic flux noise ~10^{-9}phi_0 hz^{-1/2 } below 1 k are achievable . the opportunity to access single - spin detection joined with limited dissipation ( of the order of ~ 10^{-14 } w ) make this magnetometer interesting for the investigation of the switching dynamics of molecules or individual magnetic nanoparticles .
