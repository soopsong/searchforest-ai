we introduce a gaussian version of the entanglement of formation adapted to bipartite gaussian states by considering decompositions into pure gaussian states only . we show that this quantity is an entanglement monotone under gaussian operations and provide a simplified computation for states of arbitrary many modes . for the case of one mode per site the remaining variational problem can be solved analytically . if the considered state is in addition symmetric with respect to interchanging the two modes , we prove additivity of the considered entanglement measure . moreover , in this case and considering only a single copy , our entanglement measure coincides with the true entanglement of formation .
