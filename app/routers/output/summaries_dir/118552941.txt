we have prepared meta - atoms based on radio frequency superconducting quantum interference devices ( rf squids ) and examined their tunability with dc magnetic field , rf current , and temperature . rf squids are superconducting split ring resonators in which the usual capacitance is supplemented with a josephson junction , which introduces strong nonlinearity in the rf properties . we find excellent agreement between the data and a model which regards the josephson junction as the resistively and capacitively - shunted junction . a magnetic field tunability of 80 thz / gauss at 12 ghz is observed , a total tunability of 56$%$ is achieved , and a unique electromagnetically - induced transparency feature at intermediate excitation powers is demonstrated for the first time . an rf squid metamaterial is shown to have qualitatively the same behavior as a single rf squid with regards to dc flux and temperature tuning .
