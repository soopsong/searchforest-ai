we present a general model on the simulation of the measurement - device independent quantum key distribution ( mdi - qkd ) . it can be used to predict experimental observations of a mdi - qkd with linear channel loss , simulating corresponding values for the gains , the error rates in different basis , and also the final key rates . our model can be applicable to the mdi - qkds with whatever convex source states or using whatever coding schemes . therefore , it is useful in characterizing and evaluating the performance of any mdi - qkd protocols , making it a valuable tool in studying the quantum key distributions .
