we propose two controlled remote state preparation protocols via partially entangled channels . one prepares a single - qubit state and the other prepares a two - qubit state . different from other controlled remote state preparation schemes which also utilize partially entangled channels , neither auxiliary qubits nor two - qubit unitary transformations are required in our schemes and the success probabilities are independent of the coefficients of the quantum channel . the success probabilities are 50 % and 25 % for arbitrary single - qubit states and two - qubit states , respectively . we also show that the success probabilities can reach 100 % for restricted classes of states .
