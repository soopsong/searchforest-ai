we introduce a new algebraic sieving technique to detect constrained multilinear monomials in multivariate polynomial generating functions given by an evaluation oracle . as applications of the technique , we show an $ o^*(2^k)$-time polynomial space algorithm for the $ k$-sized graph motif problem . we also introduce a new optimization variant of the problem , called closest graph motif and solve it within the same time bound . the closest graph motif problem encompasses several previously studied optimization variants , like maximum graph motif , min - substitute graph motif , and min - add graph motif . finally , we provide a piece of evidence that our result might be essentially tight : the existence of an $ o^*((2-\epsilon)^k)$-time algorithm for the graph motif problem implies an $ o((2-\epsilon')^n)$-time algorithm for set cover .
