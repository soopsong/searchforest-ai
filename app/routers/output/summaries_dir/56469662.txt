we report on the experimental demonstration of an optical spin - wave memory , based on the atomic frequency comb ( afc ) scheme , where the storage efficiency is strongly enhanced by an optical cavity . the cavity is of low finesse , but operated in an impedance matching regime to achieve high absorption in our intrinsically low - absorbing eu3+:y2sio5 crystal . for storage of optical pulses as an optical excitation ( afc echoes ) , we reach efficiencies of 53 % and 28 % for 2 and 10 microseconds delays , respectively . for a complete afc spin - wave memory we reach an efficiency of 12 % , including spin - wave dephasing , which is a 12-fold increase with respect to previous results in this material . this result is an important step towards the goal of making efficient and long - lived quantum memories based on spin waves , in the context of quantum repeaters and quantum networks .
