three entanglement concentration protocols ( ecps ) are proposed . the first ecp and a modified version of that are shown to be useful for the creation of maximally entangled cat and ghz - like states from their non - maximally entangled counterparts . the last two ecps are designed for the creation of maximally entangled $ ( n+1)$-qubit state $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|\psi_{0}\rangle|0\rangle+|\psi_{1}\rangle|1\rangle\right)$ from the partially entangled $ ( n+1)$-qubit normalized state $ \alpha|\psi_{0}\rangle|0\rangle+\beta|\psi_{1}\rangle|1\rangle$ , where $ \langle\psi_{1}|\psi_{0}\rangle=0 $ and $ |\alpha|\neq\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. it is also shown that w , ghz , ghz - like , bell and cat states and specific states from the 9 slocc - nonequivalent families of 4-qubit entangled states can be expressed as $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|\psi_{0}\rangle|0\rangle+|\psi_{1}\rangle|1\rangle\right)$ and consequently the last two ecps proposed here are applicable to all these states . quantum circuits for implementation of the proposed ecps are provided and it is shown that the proposed ecps can be realized using linear optics . efficiency of the ecps are studied using a recently introduced quantitative measure ( phys . rev . a $ \textbf{85}$ , 012307 ( 2012 ) ) . limitations of the measure are also reported .
