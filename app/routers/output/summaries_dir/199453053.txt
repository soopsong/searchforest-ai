qubit measurements are central to quantum information processing . in the field of superconducting qubits , standard readout techniques are not only limited by the signal - to - noise ratio , but also by state relaxation during the measurement . in this work , we demonstrate that the limitation due to relaxation can be suppressed by using the many - level hilbert space of superconducting circuits : in a multilevel encoding , the measurement is only corrupted when multiple errors occur . employing this technique , we show that we can directly resolve transmon gate errors at the level of one part in $ 10 ^ 3.$ extending this idea , we apply the same principles to the measurement of a logical qubit encoded in a bosonic mode and detected with a transmon ancilla , implementing a proposal by hann et al . [ phys . rev . a \textbf{98 } 022305 ( 2018 ) ] . qubit state assignments are made based on a sequence of repeated readouts , further reducing the overall infidelity . this approach is quite general and several encodings are studied ; the codewords are more distinguishable when the distance between them is increased with respect to photon loss . the tradeoff between multiple readouts and state relaxation is explored and shown to be consistent with the photon - loss model . we report a logical assignment infidelity of $ 5.8\times 10^{-5}$ for a fock - based encoding and $ 4.2\times 10^{-3}$ for a qec code ( the $ s=2,n=1 $ binomial code ) . our results will not only improve the fidelity of quantum information applications , but also enable more precise characterization of process or gate errors .
