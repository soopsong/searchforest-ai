the spatial modes of photons are one realization of a qudit , a quantum system that is described in a d - dimensional hilbert space . in order to perform quantum information tasks with qudits , a general class of d - dimensional unitary transformations is needed . among these , cyclic transformations are an important special case required in many high - dimensional quantum communication protocols . in this paper , we experimentally demonstrate a cyclic transformation in the high - dimensional space of photonic orbital angular momentum ( oam ) . using simple linear optical components , we show a successful four - fold cyclic transformation of oam modes . interestingly , our experimental setup was found by a computer algorithm . in addition to the four - cyclic transformation , the algorithm also found extensions to higher - dimensional cycles in a hybrid space of oam and polarization . besides being useful for quantum cryptography with qudits , cyclic transformations are key for the experimental production of high - dimensional maximally entangled bell - states .
