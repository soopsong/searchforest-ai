we study performance limitations of distributed feedback control in large - scale networked dynamical systems . specifically , we address the question of how the performance of distributed integral control is affected by measurement noise . we consider second - order consensus - like problems modeled over a toric lattice network , and study asymptotic scalings ( in network size ) of h2 performance metrics that quantify the variance of nodal state fluctuations . while previous studies have shown that distributed integral control fundamentally improves these performance scalings compared to distributed proportional feedback control , our results show that an explicit inclusion of measurement noise leads to the opposite conclusion . the noise 's impact on performance is shown to decrease with an increased inter - nodal alignment of the local integral states . however , even though the controller can be tuned for acceptable performance for any given network size , performance will degrade as the network grows , limiting the scalability of any such controller tuning . in particular , the requirement for inter - nodal alignment increases with network size . we show that this in practice implies that large and sparse networks will require any integral control to be centralized , rather than distributed . in this case , the best - achievable performance scaling , which is shown to be that of proportional feedback control , is retrieved .
