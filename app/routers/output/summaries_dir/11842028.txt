we discuss the possibility of preparing highly entangled states by simply cooling atoms into the ground state of an applied interaction hamiltonian . as in laser sideband cooling , we take advantage of a relatively large detuning of the desired state , while all other qubit states experience resonant laser driving . once spontaneous emission from excited atomic states prepares the system in its ground state , it remains there with a very high fidelity for a wide range of experimental parameters and all possible initial states . after presenting the general theory , we discuss concrete applications with one and two qubits .
