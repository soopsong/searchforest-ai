we develop a wavefunction approach to describe the scattering of two photons on a quantum emitter embedded in a one - dimensional waveguide . our method allows us to calculate the exact dynamics of the complete system at all times , as well as the transmission properties of the emitter . we show that the non - linearity of the emitter with respect to incoming photons depends strongly on the emitter excitation and the spectral shape of the incoming pulses , resulting in transmission of the photons which depends crucially on their separation and width . in addition , for counter - propagating pulses , we analyze the induced level of quantum correlations in the scattered state , and we show that the emitter behaves as a non - linear beam - splitter when the spectral width of the photon pulses is similar to the emitter decay rate .
