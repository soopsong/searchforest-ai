the understanding of dynamical evolutions of interacting photon pulses in rydberg atomic ensemble is the prerequisite for realizing quantum devices with such system . we present an approach that efficiently simulates the dynamical processes , using a set of local functions we construct to reflect the profiles of narrowband pulses . for two counter - propagating photon pulses , our approach predicts the distinct phenomena from the widely concerned rydberg blockade to the previously less noticed significant absorption in the anomalous dispersion regime , which can occur by respectively setting the pulse frequency to the appropriate values . our numerical simulations also demonstrate how spatially extending photon pulses become deformed under realistic non - uniform interaction over their distributions .
