we obtain explicit analytical expressions for the quadrature variances and the photon distribution functions of the electromagnetic field modes excited from vacuum or thermal states due to the non - stationary casimir effect in an ideal one - dimensional fabry - perot cavity with vibrating walls , provided the frequency of vibrations is close to a multiple frequency of the fundamental unperturbed electromagnetic mode .
