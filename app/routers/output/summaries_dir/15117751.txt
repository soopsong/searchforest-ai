resource tradeoffs can often be established by solving an appropriate robust optimization problem for a variety of scenarios involving constraints on optimization variables and uncertainties . using an approach based on sequential convex programming , we demonstrate that quantum gate transformations can be made substantially robust against uncertainties while simultaneously using limited resources of control amplitude and bandwidth . achieving such a high degree of robustness requires a quantitative model that specifies the range and character of the uncertainties . using a model of a controlled one - qubit system for illustrative simulations , we identify robust control fields for a universal gate set and explore the tradeoff between the worst - case gate fidelity and the field fluence . our results demonstrate that , even for this simple model , there exist a rich variety of control design possibilities . in addition , we study the effect of noise represented by a stochastic uncertainty model .
