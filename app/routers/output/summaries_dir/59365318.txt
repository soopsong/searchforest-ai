we propose a new configuration for realizing torsional optomechanics : an optically trapped windmill - shaped dielectric interacting with laguerre - gaussian cavity modes containing both angular and radial nodes . in contrast to existing schemes , our method can couple mechanical oscillators smaller than the optical beam waist to the in - principle unlimited orbital angular momentum that can be carried by a single photon , and thus generate substantial optomechanical interactions . combining the advantages of small mass , large coupling , and low clamping losses , our work conceptually opens the way for the observation of quantum effects in torsional optomechanics .
