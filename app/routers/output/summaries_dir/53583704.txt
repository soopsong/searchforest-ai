randomized benchmarking is routinely used as an efficient method for characterizing the performance of sets of elementary logic gates in small quantum devices . in the measurement - based model of quantum computation , logic gates are implemented via single - site measurements on a fixed universal resource state . here we adapt the randomized benchmarking protocol for a single qubit to a linear cluster state computation , which provides partial , yet efficient characterization of the noise associated with the target gate set . applying randomized benchmarking to measurement - based quantum computation exhibits an interesting interplay between the inherent randomness associated with logic gates in the measurement - based model and the random gate sequences used in benchmarking . we consider two different approaches : the first makes use of the standard single - qubit clifford group , while the second uses recently introduced ( non - clifford ) measurement - based 2-designs , which harness inherent randomness to implement gate sequences .
