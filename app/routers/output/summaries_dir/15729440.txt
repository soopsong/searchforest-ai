we show that the nanoresonator position can be squeezed significantly below the ground state level by measuring the nanoresonator with a quantum point contact or a single - electron transistor and applying a periodic voltage across the detector . the mechanism of squeezing is basically a generalization of quantum nondemolition measurement of an oscillator to the case of continuous measurement by a weakly coupled detector . the quantum feedback is necessary to prevent the " heating " due to measurement back - action . we also discuss a procedure of experimental verification of the squeezed state .
