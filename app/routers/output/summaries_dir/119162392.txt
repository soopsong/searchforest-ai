we show that weyl semimetals with broken time - reversal symmetry can host chiral electromag- netic waves . the magnetization that results in a momentum space separation of a pair of opposite chirality weyl nodes is also responsible for the non - zero gyrotropy parameter in the system . it is then shown that a chiral electromagnetic wave can propagate in a region of space where the gyrotropy parameter changes sign . such waves are analogs of quantum hall edge states for photons .
