models of quantum gravity imply a fundamental revision of our description of position and momentum that manifests in modifications of the canonical commutation relations . experimental tests of such modifications remain an outstanding challenge . these corrections scale with the mass of test particles , which motivates experiments using macroscopic composite particles . here we consider a challenge to such tests , namely that quantum gravity corrections of canonical commutation relations are expected to be suppressed with increasing number of constituent particles . since the precise scaling of this suppression is unknown , it needs to be bounded experimentally and explicitly incorporated into rigorous analyses of quantum gravity tests . we analyse this scaling based on concrete experiments involving macroscopic pendula and provide tight bounds that exceed those of current experiments based on quantum mechanical oscillators . furthermore , we discuss possible experiments that promise even stronger bounds thus bringing rigorous and well - controlled tests of quantum gravity closer to reality .
