quasiprobability distributions ( qds ) in open quantum systems are investigated for $ su(2)$ , spin like systems , having relevance to quantum optics and information . in this work , effect of both quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) and dissipative open quantum systems , on the evolution of a number of spin qds are investigated . specifically , compact analytic expressions for the $ w$ , $ p$ , $ q$ , and $ f$ functions are obtained for some interesting single , two and three qubit states , undergoing general open system evolutions . further , corresponding qds are reported for an n qubit dicke model and a spin-1 system . the existence of nonclassical characteristics are observed in all the systems investigated here . the study leads to a clear understanding of quantum to classical transition in a host of realistic physical scenarios . variation of the amount of nonclassicality observed in the quantum systems , studied here , are also investigated using nonclassical volume .
