the increasing interest in using quantum error correcting codes in practical devices has heightened the need for designing quantum error correcting codes that can correct against specialized errors , such as that of amplitude damping errors which model photon loss . although considerable research has been devoted to quantum error correcting codes for amplitude damping , not so much attention has been paid to having these codes simultaneously lie within the decoherence free subspace of their underlying physical system . one common physical system comprises of quantum harmonic oscillators , and constant - excitation quantum codes can be naturally stabilized within them . the purpose of this paper is to give constant - excitation quantum codes that not only correct amplitude damping errors , but are also immune against permutations of their underlying modes . to construct such quantum codes , we use the nullspace of a specially constructed matrix based on integer partitions .
