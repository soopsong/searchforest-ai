quantum search on the two - dimensional lattice with one marked vertex and cyclic boundary conditions is an important problem in the context of quantum algorithms with an interesting unfolding . it avails to test the ability of quantum walk models to provide efficient algorithms from the theoretical side and means to implement quantum walks in laboratories from the practical side . in this paper , we rigorously prove that the recent - proposed staggered quantum walk model provides an efficient quantum search on the two - dimensional lattice , if the reflection operators associated with the graph tessellations are used as hamiltonians , which is an important theoretical result for validating the staggered model with hamiltonians . numerical results show that on the two - dimensional lattice staggered models without hamiltonians are not as efficient as the one described in this paper and are , in fact , as slow as classical random - walk - based algorithms .
