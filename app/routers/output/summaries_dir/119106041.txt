coherence properties of the down - converted beams generated in spontaneous parametric down - conversion are investigated in detail using an iccd camera . experimental results are compared with those from a theoretical model developed for pulsed pumping with a gaussian transverse profile . the results allow to tailor the shape of correlation area of the signal and idler photons using pump - field and crystal parameters . as an example , splitting of a correlation area caused by a two - peak pump - field spectrum is experimentally studied .
