we theoretically study the propagation of light through a cold atomic medium , where the effects of motion , laser intensity , atomic density , and polarization can all modify the properties of the scattered light . we present two different microscopic models : the"coherent dipole model"and the"random walk model " , both suitable for modeling recent experimental work done in large atomic arrays in the low light intensity regime . we use them to compute relevant observables such as the linewidth , peak intensity and line center of the emitted light . we further develop generalized models that explicitly take into account atomic motion . those are relevant for hotter atoms and beyond the low intensity regime . we show that atomic motion can lead to drastic dephasing and to a reduction of collective effects , together with a distortion of the lineshape . our results are applicable to model a full gamut of quantum systems that rely on atom - light interactions including atomic clocks , quantum simulators and nanophotonic systems .
