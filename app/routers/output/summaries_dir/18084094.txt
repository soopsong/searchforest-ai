we report on the study of the noise properties of laser light propagating through a cold 87rb atomic sample held in a magneto - optical trap . the laser is tuned around the fg = 2 \rightarrow fe = 1 , 2 d1 transitions of 87rb . we observe quadrature - dependent noise in the light signal , an indication that it may be possible to produce squeezed states of light . we measure the minimum and maximum phase - dependent noise as a function of detuning and compare these results to theoretical predictions to explore the best conditions for light squeezing using cold atomic rb .
