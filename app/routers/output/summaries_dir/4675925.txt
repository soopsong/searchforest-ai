we discuss the detection of an anisotropic particle trapped by an elliptically polarized focused gaussian laser beam . we obtain the full rotational and translational dynamics , as well as , the measured photo - current in a general - dyne detection . as an example , we discuss a toy model of homodyne detection , which captures the main features typically found in experimental setups .
