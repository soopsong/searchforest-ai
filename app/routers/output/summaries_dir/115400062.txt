quantum aided byzantine agreement ( qba ) is an important distributed quantum algorithm with unique features in comparison to classical deterministic and randomized algorithms , requiring only a constant expected number of rounds in addition to giving higher level of security . in this paper , we analyze details of the high level multi - party algorithm , and propose elements of the design for the quantum architecture and circuits required at each node to run the algorithm on a quantum repeater network . our optimization techniques have reduced the quantum circuit depth by 44\% and the number of qubits in each node by 20\% for a minimum five - node setup compared to the design based on the standard arithmetic circuits . these improvements lead to an architecture with $ kq \approx 1.3 \times 10^{5}$ per node and error threshold $ 1.1 \times 10^{-6}$ for the total nodes in the network . the evaluation of the designed architecture shows that to execute the algorithm once on the minimum setup , we need to successfully distribute a total of 648 bell pairs across the network , spread evenly between all pairs of nodes . this framework can be considered a starting point for establishing a road - map for light - weight demonstration of a distributed quantum application on quantum repeater networks .
