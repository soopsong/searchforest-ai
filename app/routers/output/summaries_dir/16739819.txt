quantum cryptography is a rapidly developing field of research that benefits from the properties of quantum mechanics in performing cryptographic tasks . quantum walks are a powerful model for quantum computation and very promising for quantum information processing . in this paper , we present a quantum public - key cryptographic system based on quantum walks . in particular , in the proposed protocol the public key is given by a quantum state generated by performing a quantum walk . we show that the protocol is secure and analyze the complexity of public - key generation and encryption / decryption procedures .
