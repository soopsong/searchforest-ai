the appearance of negative terms in quasiprobability representations of quantum theory is known to be inevitable , and , due to its equivalence with the onset of contextuality , of central interest in quantum computation and information . until recently , however , nothing has been known about how much negativity is necessary in a quasiprobability representation . zhu proved that the upper and lower bounds with respect to one type of negativity measure are saturated by quasiprobability representations which are in one - to - one correspondence with the elusive symmetric informationally complete quantum measurements ( sics ) . we define a family of negativity measures which includes zhu 's as a special case and consider another member of the family which we call"sum negativity . "we prove a sufficient condition for local maxima in sum negativity and find exact global maxima in dimensions $ 3 $ and $ 4$. notably , we find that zhu 's result on the sics does not generally extend to sum negativity , although the analogous result does hold in dimension $ 4$. finally , the hoggar lines in dimension $ 8 $ make an appearance in a conjecture on sum negativity .
