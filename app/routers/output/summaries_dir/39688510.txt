quantum walks are a well - established model for the study of coherent transport phenomena and provide a universal platform in quantum information theory . dynamically influencing the walker 's evolution gives a high degree of flexibility for studying various applications . here , we present time - multiplexed finite quantum walks of variable size , the preparation of non - localized input states and their dynamical evolution . as a further application , we implement a state transfer scheme for an arbitrary input state to two different output modes . the presented experiments rely on the full dynamical control of a time - multiplexed quantum walk , which includes adjustable coin operation as well as the possibility to flexibly configure the underlying graph structures .
