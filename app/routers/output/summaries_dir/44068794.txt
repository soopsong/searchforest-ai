a number of techniques exist to use an ensemble of atoms as a quantum memory for light . many of these propose to use backward retrieval as a way to improve the storage and recall efficiency . we report on a demonstration of an off - resonant raman memory that uses backward retrieval to achieve an efficiency of $ 65\pm6\%$ at a storage time of one pulse duration . the memory has a characteristic decay time of 60 $ \mu$s , corresponding to a delay - bandwidth product of $ 160$.
