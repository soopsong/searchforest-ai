in this paper , we compare the transient performance of a multi - terminal high - voltage dc ( mtdc ) grid equipped with a slack bus for voltage control to that of two distributed control schemes : a standard droop controller and a distributed averaging proportional - integral ( dapi ) controller . we evaluate performance in terms of an h2 metric that quantifies expected deviations from nominal voltages , and show that the transient performance of a droop or dapi controlled mtdc grid is always superior to that of an mtdc grid with a slack bus . in particular , by studying systems built up over lattice networks , we show that the h2 norm of a slack bus controlled system may scale unboundedly with network size , while the norm remains uniformly bounded with droop or dapi control . we simulate the control strategies on radial mtdc networks to demonstrate that the transient performance for the slack bus controlled system deteriorates significantly as the network grows , which is not the case with the distributed control strategies .
