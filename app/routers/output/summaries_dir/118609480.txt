detection of radiation signals is at the heart of precision metrology and sensing . in this article we show how the fluctuations in photon counting signals can be exploited to optimally extract information about the physical parameters that govern the dynamics of the emitter . for a simple two - level emitter subject to photon counting , we show that the fisher information and the cram\'er- rao sensitivity bound based on the full detection record can be evaluated from the waiting time distribution in the fluorescence signal which can , in turn , be calculated for both perfect and imperfect detectors by a quantum trajectory analysis . we provide an optimal estimator achieving that bound .
