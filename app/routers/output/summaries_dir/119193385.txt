we describe numbat , an open - source software tool for modelling stimulated brillouin scattering in waveguides of arbitrary cross - section . it provides rapid calculation of optical and elastic dispersion relations , field profiles and gain with an easy - to - use python front end . additionally , we provide an open and extensible set of standard problems and reference materials to facilitate the bench - marking of numbat against subsequent tools . such a resource is needed to help settle discrepancies between existing formulations and implementations , and to facilitate comparison between results in the literature . the resulting standardised testing framework will allow the community to gain confidence in new algorithms and will provide a common tool for the comparison of experimental designs of opto - acoustic waveguides .
