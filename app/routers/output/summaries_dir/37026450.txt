the dynamics of many open quantum systems are described by stochastic master equations . in the discrete - time case , we recall the structure of the derived quantum filter governing the evolution of the density operator conditioned to the measurement outcomes . we then describe the structure of the corresponding particle quantum filters for estimating constant parameter and we prove their stability . in the continuous - time ( diffusive ) case , we propose a new formulation of these particle quantum filters . the interest of this new formulation is first to prove stability , and also to provide an efficient algorithm preserving , for any discretization step - size , positivity of the quantum states and parameter classical probabilities . this algorithm is tested on experimental data to estimate the detection efficiency for a superconducting qubit whose fluorescence field is measured using a heterodyne detector .
