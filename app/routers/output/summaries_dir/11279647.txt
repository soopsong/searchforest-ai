we present a synthesis framework to map logic networks into quantum circuits for quantum computing . the synthesis framework is based on lut networks ( lookup - table networks ) , which play a key role in conventional logic synthesis . establishing a connection between luts in a lut network and reversible single - target gates in a reversible network allows us to bridge conventional logic synthesis with logic synthesis for quantum computing , despite several fundamental differences . we call our synthesis framework lut - based hierarchical reversible logic synthesis ( lhrs ) . input to lhrs is a classical logic network ; output is a quantum network ( realized in terms of clifford+$t$ gates ) . the framework offers to trade - off the number of qubits for the number of quantum gates . in a first step , an initial network is derived that only consists of single - target gates and already completely determines the number of qubits in the final quantum network . different methods are then used to map each single - target gate into clifford+$t$ gates , while aiming at optimally using available resources . we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in automatically synthesizing ieee compliant floating point networks up to double precision . as many quantum algorithms target scientific simulation applications , they can make rich use of floating point arithmetic components . but due to the lack of quantum circuit descriptions for those components , it can be difficult to find a realistic cost estimation for the algorithms . our synthesized benchmarks provide cost estimates that allow quantum algorithm designers to provide the first complete cost estimates for a host of quantum algorithms . thus , the benchmarks and , more generally , the lhrs framework are an essential step towards the goal of understanding which quantum algorithms will be practical in the first generations of quantum computers .
