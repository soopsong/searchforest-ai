acousto - optic interaction in optomechanical crystals allows unidirectional control of elastic waves over optical waves . however , as a result of this nonlinear interaction , infinitely many optical modes are born . this article presents an exact formulaion of coupled mode theory for interaction between elastic and photonic bloch waves moving along an optomechanical waveguide . in general , an optical wavefront is strongly diffracted by an elastic wave in frequency and wavevector , and thus infinite modes with different frequencies and wavevectors appear . we discuss resonance and mode conversion conditions , and present a rigorous method to derive coupling rates and mode profiles . we also find a conservation law which rules over total optical power from interacting individual modes . we present application examples to the theory to optomechanical waveguides and cavities , as well as non - reciprocal transmission of light and optomechanical switches .
