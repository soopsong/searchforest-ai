we investigate the behavior of genuine multiparticle entanglement , as quantified by the generalized geometric measure , in gapless - to - gapped quantum transitions of one- and two - dimensional quantum spin models . the investigations are performed in the exactly solvable one - dimensional $ xy$ models , as well as two - dimensional frustrated $ j_{1}-j_{2}$ models , including the shastry - sutherland model . the generalized geometric measure shows non - monotonic features near such transitions in the frustrated quantum systems . we also compare the features of the generalized geometric measure near the quantum critical points with the same for measures of bipartite quantum correlations . the multipartite quantum correlation measure turns out to be a better indicator of quantum critical points than the bipartite measures , especially for two - dimensional models .
