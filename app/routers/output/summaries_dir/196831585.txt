wave - function collapse models predict a tiny break of energy conservation via a weak spontaneous stochastic force acting on the system , and are attracting experimental studies . among various physical systems , mechanical based methods provide a direct way to test such collapse induced force without any assumptions on its spectral characteristics . levitated micro - mechanical oscillator has been recently proposed to be an ideal system . we demonstrated a micro - oscillator generated by a micro - sphere diamagnetically levitated in a magneto - gravitational trap under high vacuum . due to the ultra - low mechanical dissipation and small mass , the oscillator provides a new upper bound on the wave - function collapse rate , two orders of magnitudes improvement over the previous bound in the same frequency range , and partially ruled out the enhanced collapse rate suggested by adler . being performed at room temperature , our experiment has already exhibited advantages over those methods operating at ultra - low temperatures previously reported . our results experimentally show the potential of magneto - gravitational levitated mechanical oscillator as a promising method for searching wave - function collapse , and cryogenic experiments to further improvements are discussed .
