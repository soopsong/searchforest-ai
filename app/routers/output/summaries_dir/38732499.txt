the problem of ordering of two - qubit states imposed by relative entropy of entanglement ( e ) in comparison to concurrence ( c ) and negativity ( n ) is studied . analytical examples of states consistently and inconsistently ordered by the entanglement measures are given . in particular , the states for which any of the three measures imposes order opposite to that given by the other two measures are described . moreover , examples are given of pairs of the states , for which ( i ) n'=n ' ' and c'=c ' ' but e ' is different from e ' ' , ( ii ) n'=n ' ' and e'=e ' ' but c ' differs from c ' ' , ( iii ) e'=e ' ' , n'<n ' ' and c'>c ' ' , or ( iv ) states having the same e , c , and n but still violating the bell - clauser - horne - shimony - holt inequality to different degrees .
