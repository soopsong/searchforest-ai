a novel bulk optics scheme for quantum walks is presented . it consists of a one - dimensional lattice built on two concatenated displaced sagnac interferometers that make it possible to reproduce all the possible trajectories of an optical quantum walk . because of the closed loop configuration , the interferometric structure is intrinsically stable in phase . moreover , the lattice structure is highly configurable , as any phase component perceived by the walker is accessible , and finally , all output modes can be measured at any step of the quantum walk evolution . we report here on the experimental implementation of ordered and disordered quantum walks .
