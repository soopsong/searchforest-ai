we find out a few ways to improve the realization of entanglement between the internal ( spin ) and external ( position ) degrees of freedom of a quantum particle , through the insertion of disordered time steps along a one - dimensional discrete time quantum walk . the disorder is introduced by a randomly chosen quantum coin obtained from a uniform distribution among infinite quantum coins or only between hadamard and fourier coins for all the time steps . we can also decrease the amount of disorder by alternating disordered and ordered time steps along a quantum walk or by establishing a probability $ p<0.5 $ to pick a fourier coin instead of a hadamard one for each time step . our results show that both scenarios lead to maximal entanglement outperforming the ordered quantum walks . however , these last scenarios are more efficient to create entanglement , once they achieve high entanglement rates in fewer time steps than the former ones . in order to compare distinct disordered cases , we perform an average entanglement calculation along the time by averaging over a large set of initial spin states starting from local and gaussian position states . some transient behaviors from order to disorder in quantum walks are also evaluated and discussed . experimental remarks based on available experimental platforms are made .
