we investigate the possibility that quantum effects responsible for black hole radiation do not allow for hori- zon crossing of gravitationally collapsing matter in a finite time as seen by distant observers . we consider this in the context of the collapse of evaporating massive thin dust shells using two families of metrics to describe the exterior geometry : the outgoing vaidya metric and the retarded schwarzschild metric . we describe how this hypothesis results in a modified equation of motion for the shell . in each case the collapse is accelerated due to evaporation , but the schwarzschild radius is not crossed . instead the shell is always at a certain sub - planckian distance from this would - be horizon that depends only on the mass and evaporation rate , while a comoving observer encounters firewall - like energy density and flux with a natural cutoff .
