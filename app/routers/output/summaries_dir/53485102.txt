we describe high - fidelity entangling gates between singlet - triplet qubits ( stqs ) which are coupled via one quantum state ( qs ) . the qs can be provided by a quantum dot itself or by another confined system . the orbital energies of the qs are tunable using an electric gate close to the qs , which changes the interactions between the stqs independent of their single - qubit parameters . short gating sequences exist for the controlled not ( cnot ) operations . we show that realistic quantum dot setups permit excellent entangling operations with gate infidelities below $ 10^{-3}$ , which is lower than the quantum error correction threshold of the surface code . we consider limitations from fabrication errors , hyperfine interactions , spin - orbit interactions , and charge noise in gaas and si heterostructures .
