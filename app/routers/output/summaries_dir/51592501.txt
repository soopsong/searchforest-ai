the thorough experimental study for the measure of sustainability of the atmospheric turbulence of the entangled photons for two qubit has been analysed by g. puentes et al . [ phys . rev . a 75 , 032319 ( 2007 ) ] . here in this paper we propose a scheme to measure the effect of entanglement in three entangled photon ghz state with the help of simulated atmospheric turbulence . we simulate the result of affected entangled ghz state by introducing turbulence in three entangled photon path alternatively . we observe , by introducing the turbulence in photon path we are loosing the entanglement property , because of the increase in entropy . we compare our result with werner curve and observe that the simulated result perfectly fit with the theoretical result .
