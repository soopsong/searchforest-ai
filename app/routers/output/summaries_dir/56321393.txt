the fabrication of memristors by drop - coating sol - gel ti(oh)$_4 $ solution onto either aluminium foil or sputter - coated aluminium on plastic is presented . the gel layer is thick , 37$\mu$m , but both devices exhibit good memristance i - v profiles . the drop coated aluminium foil memristors compare favourably with the sputter - coated ones , demonstrating an expansion in the accessibility of memristor fabrication . a comparison between aluminium and gold for use as the sputter - coated electrodes shows that aluminium is the better choice as using gold leads to device failure . the devices do not require a forming step .
