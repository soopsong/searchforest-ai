the stability of the topological order phase induced by the $ z_3 $ kitaev model , which is a candidate for fault - tolerant quantum computation , against the local order phase induced by the 3-state potts model is studied . we show that the low energy sector of the kitaev - potts model is mapped to the potts model in the presence of transverse magnetic field . our study relies on two high - order series expansion based on continuous unitary transformations in the limits of small- and large - potts couplings as well as mean - field approximation . our analysis reveals that the topological phase of the $ z_3 $ kitaev model breaks down to the potts model through a first order phase transition . we capture the phase transition by analysis of the ground state energy , one - quasiparticle gap and geometric measure of entanglement .
