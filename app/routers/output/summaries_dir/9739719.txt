in this work we analyze the distribution of quantum entanglement over communication channels in the millimeter - wave regime . the motivation for such a study is the possibility for next - generation wireless networks ( beyond 5 g ) to accommodate such a distribution directly - without the need to integrate additional optical communication hardware into the transceivers . future wireless communication systems are bound to require some level of quantum communications capability . we find that direct quantum - entanglement distribution in the millimeter - wave regime is indeed possible , but that its implementation will be very demanding from both a system - design perspective and a channel - requirement perspective .
