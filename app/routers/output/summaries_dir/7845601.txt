an extensive characterization of high finesse optical cavities used in cavity qed experiments is described . different techniques in the measurement of the loss and phase shifts associated with the mirror coatings are discussed and their agreement shown . issues of cavity field mode structure supported by the dielectric coatings are related to our effort to achieve the strongest possible coupling between an atom and the cavity .
