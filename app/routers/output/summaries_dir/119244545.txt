two quantum channels are called compatible if they can be obtained as marginals from a single broadcasting channel ; otherwise they are incompatible . we derive a characterization of the compatibility relation in terms of concatenation and conjugation , and we show that all pairs of sufficiently noisy quantum channels are compatible . the complement relation of incompatibility can be seen as a unifying aspect for many quantum features . we demonstrate that several phenomena , such as impossibility of universal broadcasting and unavoidable measurement disturbance , appear naturally in this framework .
