coherent states are required to form a complete set of vectors in the hilbert space by providing the resolution of identity . we study the completeness of coherent states for two different models in a noncommutative space associated with the generalised uncertainty relation by finding the resolution of unity with a positive definite weight function . the weight function , which is sometimes known as the borel measure , is obtained through explicit analytic solutions of the stieltjes and hausdorff moment problem with the help of the standard techniques of inverse mellin transform .
