metaplectic quantum basis is a universal multi - qutrit quantum basis , formed by the ternary clifford group and the axial reflection gate $ r=|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| - |2\rangle \langle 2|$. it is arguably , a ternary basis with the simplest geometry . recently cui , kliuchnikov , wang and the author have proposed a compilation algorithm to approximate any two - level householder reflection to precision $ \varepsilon$ by a metaplectic circuit of $ r$-count at most $ c \ , \log_3(1/\varepsilon ) + o(\log \log 1/\varepsilon)$ with $ c=8$. a new result in this note takes the constant down to $ c=5 $ for non - exceptional target reflections under a certain credible number - theoretical conjecture . the new method increases the chances of obtaining a truly optimal circuit but may not guarantee the true optimality . efficient approximations of an important ternary quantum gate proposed by howard , campbell and others is also discussed . apart from this , the note is mostly didactical : we demonstrate how to leverage lenstra 's integer geometry algorithm from 1983 for circuit synthesis .
