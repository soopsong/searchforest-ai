we describe new constructions of graphs which exhibit perfect state transfer on continuous - time quantum walks . our constructions are based on variants of the double cones [ bcms09,anoprt10,anoprt09 ] and the cartesian graph products ( which includes the n - cube ) [ cddekl05 ] . some of our results include : ( 1 ) if $ g$ is a graph with perfect state transfer at time $ t_{g}$ , where $ t_{g}\spec(g ) \subseteq \zz\pi$ , and $ h$ is a circulant with odd eigenvalues , their weak product $ g \times h$ has perfect state transfer . also , if $ h$ is a regular graph with perfect state transfer at time $ t_{h}$ and $ g$ is a graph where $ t_{h}|v_{h}|\spec(g ) \subseteq 2\zz\pi$ , their lexicographic product $ g[h]$ has perfect state transfer . ( 2 ) the double cone $ \overline{k}_{2 } + g$ on any connected graph $ g$ , has perfect state transfer if the weights of the cone edges are proportional to the perron eigenvector of $ g$. this generalizes results for double cone on regular graphs studied in [ bcms09,anoprt10,anoprt09 ] . ( 3 ) for an infinite family $ \gg$ of regular graphs , there is a circulant connection so the graph $ k_{1}+\gg\circ\gg+k_{1}$ has perfect state transfer . in contrast , no perfect state transfer exists if a complete bipartite connection is used ( even in the presence of weights ) [ anoprt09 ] . we also describe a generalization of the path collapsing argument [ ccdfgs03,cddekl05 ] , which reduces questions about perfect state transfer to simpler ( weighted ) multigraphs , for graphs with equitable distance partitions .
