we investigate the unruh effect on entanglement taking into account the spin degree of freedom of the dirac field . we analyze spin bell states in this setting , obtaining their entanglement dependance on the acceleration of one of the partners . then , we consider simple analogs to the occupation number entangled state |00>+|11 > , but with spin quantum numbers for |11 > showing that , despite their apparent similitude , while the spinless case is always qubit x qubit , for the spin case acceleration produces a qubit x qu4it state . we also introduce a procedure to consistently erase the spin information from our setting preserving occupation numbers . we show how the maximally entangled state for occupation number emerges from our setting , we also analyze its entanglement dependance on acceleration , obtaining a greater entanglement degradation than in the spinless case .
