a novel interferometric method - sliver ( super localization by image inversion interferometry ) - is proposed for estimating the separation of two incoherent point sources with a mean squared error that does not deteriorate as the sources are brought closer . the essential component of the interferometer is an image inversion device that inverts the field in the transverse plane about the optical axis , assumed to pass through the centroid of the sources . the performance of the device is analyzed using the cram\'er - rao bound applied to the statistics of spatially - unresolved photon counting using photon number - resolving and on - off detectors . the analysis is supported by monte - carlo simulations of the maximum likelihood estimator for the source separation , demonstrating the superlocalization effect for separations well below that set by the rayleigh criterion . simulations indicating the robustness of sliver to mismatch between the optical axis and the centroid are also presented . the results are valid for any imaging system with a circularly symmetric point - spread function .
