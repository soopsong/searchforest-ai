quantum discord quantifies non - classical correlations going beyond the standard classification of quantum states into entangled and unentangled ones . although it has received considerable attention , it still lacks any precise interpretation in terms of some protocol in which quantum features are relevant . here we give quantum discord its first operational meaning in terms of entanglement consumption in an extended quantum state merging protocol . we further relate the asymmetry of quantum discord with the performance imbalance in quantum state merging and dense coding .
