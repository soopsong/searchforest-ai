we demonstrate that a highly excited quantum electromagnetic mode strongly interacting with a single qubit exhibits several distinct resonances in addition to the bloch - siegert resonance condition that arises in the interaction with classical radiation . the resonance phenomena are associated with non - classical effects : collapse of rabi oscillations , splitting of the photon wave packet , and field - qubit entanglement . the analysis is based on a semiclassical phase - space flow of 2-by-2 matrices and becomes exact when the photon number tends to infinity . the flow equations are solved perturbatively and numerically , showing that the resonant detuning of the field and qubit frequencies lie on two branches in the leading order , that further split into distinct curves in higher orders .
