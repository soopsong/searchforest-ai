we propose an implementation of a twin paradox scenario in superconducting circuits , with velocities as large as a few percent of the speed of light . ultrafast modulation of the boundary conditions for the electromagnetic field in a microwave cavity simulates a clock moving at relativistic speeds . since our cavity has a finite length , the setup allows us to investigate the role of clock size as well as interesting quantum effects on time dilation . in particular , our theoretical results show that the time dilation increases for larger cavity lengths and is shifted due to quantum particle creation .
