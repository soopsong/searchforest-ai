boson sampling is the problem of sampling from the same output probability distribution as a collection of indistinguishable single photons input into a linear interferometer . it has been shown that , subject to certain computational complexity conjectures , in general the problem is difficult to solve classically , motivating optical experiments aimed at demonstrating quantum computational"supremacy " . there are a number of challenges faced by such experiments , including the generation of indistinguishable single photons . we provide a quantum circuit that simulates bosonic sampling with arbitrarily distinguishable particles . this makes clear how distinguishabililty leads to decoherence in the standard quantum circuit model , allowing insight to be gained . at the heart of the circuit is the quantum schur transform , which follows from a representation theoretic approach to the physics of distinguishable particles in first quantisation . the techniques are quite general and have application beyond boson sampling .
