we present , characterize , and apply a photonic quantum interface between the near infrared and telecom spectral regions . a singly resonant optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) operated below threshold , in combination with external filters , generates high - rate ( $ > 2.5\cdot10 ^ 6~{\rm s}^{-1}$ ) narrowband photon pairs ( $ \sim 7 $ mhz bandwidth ) ; the signal photons are tuned to resonance with an atomic transition in ca$^+$ , while the idler photons are at telecom wavelength . quantum interface operation is demonstrated through high - rate absorption of single photons by a single trapped ion ( $ \sim 670~{\rm s}^{-1}$ ) , heralded by coincident telecom photons .
