the purpose of this paper is to present a mathematical framework for analyzing the response of quantum linear systems driven by multi - photon states . both the factorizable ( namely , no correlation among the photons in the channel ) and unfactorizable multi - photon states are treated . pulse information of multi - photon input state is encoded in terms of tensor , and response of quantum linear systems to multi - photon input states is characterized by tensor operations . analytic forms of output correlation functions and output states are derived . the proposed framework is applicable no matter whether the underlying quantum dynamic system is passive or active . the results presented here generalize those in the single - photon setting studied in ( milburn , 2008 ) and ( zhang and james , 2013 } ) . moreover , interesting multi - photon interference phenomena studied in ( sanaka , resch , and zeilinger , 2006 ) , ( ou , 2007 ) , and ( bartley , et al . , 2012 ) can be reproduced in the proposed framework
