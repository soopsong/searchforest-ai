the so called $ f(x)$ hybrid metric - palatini gravity presents a unique viable generalisation of the $ f(r)$ theories within the metric - affine formalism . here the cosmology of the $ f(x)$ theories is studied using the dynamical system approach . the method consists of formulating the propagation equation in terms of suitable ( expansion - normalised ) variables as an autonomous system . the fixed points of the system then represent exact cosmological solutions described by power - law or de sitter expansion . the formalism is applied to two classes of $ f(x)$ models , revealing both standard cosmological fixed points and new accelerating solutions that can be attractors in the phase space . in addition , the fixed point with vanishing expansion rate are considered with special care in order to characterise the stability of einstein static spaces and bouncing solutions .
