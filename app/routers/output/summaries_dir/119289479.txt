we present a scheme for engineering the joint spectrum of photon pairs created via spontaneous parametric down conversion . our method relies on customizing the poling configuration of a quasi - phase - matched crystal . we use simulated annealing to find an optimized poling configuration which allows almost arbitrary shaping of the crystal 's phase - matching function . this has direct application in the creation of pure single photons --- currently one of the most important goals of single - photon quantum optics . we describe the general algorithm and provide code , written in c++ , that outputs an optimized poling configuration given specific experimental parameters .
