the derivation of the brackets among coordinates and momenta for classical constrained systems is a necessary step toward their quantization . here we present a new approach for the determination of the classical brackets which does neither require dirac 's formalism nor the symplectic method of faddeev and jackiw . this approach is based on the computation of the brackets between the constants of integration of the exact solutions of the equations of motion . from them all brackets of the dynamical variables of the system can be deduced in a straightforward way .
