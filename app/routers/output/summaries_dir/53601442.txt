systems of atoms coupled to a single or few waveguide modes provide a testbed for physically and practically interesting interference effects . we consider the dynamics of a pair of atoms , approximated as two - level quantum emitters , coupled to a linear guided mode . in particular , we analyze the evolution of an initial state in which both atoms are excited , which is expected to decay into an asymptotic two - photon state . we investigate the lifetime of the initial configuration and the properties of the asymptotic photon correlations , and analyze the probability that the two photons are emitted in the same or in opposite directions . we find that the ratio r between parallel and antiparallel emission probabilities is maximal when the interatomic distance is a half - multiple of the half - wavelength of the emitted light . in such a case , r=3 in the small - coupling regime .
