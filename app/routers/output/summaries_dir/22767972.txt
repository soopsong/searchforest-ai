in this work , we give a description of the process of teleportation between alice in an inertial frame , and rob who is in uniform acceleration with respect to alice . the fidelity of the teleportation is reduced due to unruh radiation in rob 's frame . in so far as teleportation is a measure of entanglement , our results suggest that quantum entanglement is degraded in non inertial frames .
