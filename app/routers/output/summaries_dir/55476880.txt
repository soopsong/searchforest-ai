recent detections of merging black holes allow observational tests of the nature of these objects . in some proposed models , non - trivial structure at or near the black hole horizon could lead to echo signals in gravitational wave data . recently , abedi et al . claimed tentative evidence for repeating damped echo signals following the gravitational - wave signals of the binary black hole merger events recorded in the first observational period of the advanced ligo interferometers . we reanalyse the same data , addressing some of the shortcomings of their method using more background data and a modified procedure . we find a reduced statistical significance for the claims of evidence for echoes , calculating increased p - values for the null hypothesis of echo - free noise . the reduced significance is entirely consistent with noise , and so we conclude that the analysis of abedi et al . does not provide any observational evidence for the existence of planck - scale structure at black hole horizons .
