we analyze a direct parity measurement of the state of three superconducting qubits in circuit quantum electrodynamics . the parity is inferred from a homodyne measurement of the reflected / transmitted microwave radiation and the measurement is direct in the sense that the parity is measured without the need for any quantum circuit operations or for ancilla qubits . qubits are coupled to two resonant cavity modes , allowing the steady state of the emitted radiation to satisfy the necessary conditions to act as a pointer state for the parity . however , the transient dynamics violates these conditions and we analyze this detrimental effect and show that it can be overcome in the limit of weak measurement signal . our analysis shows that , with a moderate degree of post - selection , it is possible to achieve post - measurement states with fidelity of order 95 % . we believe that this type of measurement could serve as a benchmark for future error - correction protocols in a scalable architecture .
