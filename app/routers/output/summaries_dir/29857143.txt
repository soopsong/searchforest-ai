we review our experiments on quantum information processing with neutral atoms in optical lattices and magnetic microtraps . atoms in an optical lattice in the mott insulator regime serve as a large qubit register . a spin - dependent lattice is used to split and delocalize the atomic wave functions in a controlled and coherent way over a defined number of lattice sites . this is used to experimentally demonstrate a massively parallel quantum gate array , which allows the creation of a highly entangled many - body cluster state through coherent collisions between atoms on neighbouring lattice sites . in magnetic microtraps on an atom chip , we demonstrate coherent manipulation of atomic qubit states and measure coherence lifetimes exceeding one second at micron - distance from the chip surface . we show that microwave near - fields on the chip can be used to create state - dependent potentials for the implementation of a quantum controlled phase gate with these robust qubit states . for single atom detection and preparation , we have developed high finesse fiber fabry - perot cavities and integrated them on the atom chip . we present an experiment in which we detected a very small number of cold atoms magnetically trapped in the cavity using the atom chip .
