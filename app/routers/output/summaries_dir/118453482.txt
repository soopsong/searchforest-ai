following a review of quantum - classical hybrid dynamics , we discuss the ensuing proliferation of observables and relate it to measurements of ( would - be ) quantum mechanical degrees of freedom performed by ( would - be ) classical ones ( if they were separable ) . -- hybrids consist in coupled classical ( " cl " ) and quantum mechanical ( " qm " ) objects . numerous consistency requirements for their description have been discussed and are fulfilled here . we summarize a representation of quantum mechanics in terms of classical analytical mechanics which is naturally extended to qm - cl hybrids . this framework allows for superposition , separable , and entangled states originating in the qm sector , admits experimenter's"free will " , and is local and non - signalling . -- presently , we study the set of hybrid observables , which is larger than the cartesian product of qm and cl observables of its components ; yet it is smaller than a corresponding product of all - classical observables . thus , quantumness and classicality infect each other .
