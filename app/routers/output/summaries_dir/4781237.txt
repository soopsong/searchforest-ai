we discuss a simple quantum thermal machine for the generation of steady - state entanglement between two interacting qubits . the machine is autonomous in the sense that it uses only incoherent interactions with thermal baths , but no source of coherence or external control . by weakly coupling the qubits to thermal baths at different temperatures , inducing a heat current through the system , steady - state entanglement is generated far from thermal equilibrium . finally , we discuss two possible implementations , using superconducting flux qubits or a semiconductor double quantum dot . experimental prospects for steady - state entanglement are promising in both systems .
