the ability to efficiently realize storage and readout of optical squeezed states plays a key roll in continuous - variables quantum information processing . here we study the quantum memory ( qm ) for squeezed state of propagating light in atoms based on the hybrid photon echo re - phasing ( hyper ) . the optical quantum state is recorded in two sublevels of the ground state of an atomic ensemble to realize long - lived qm . taking into account the noise effect due to atomic decay , our estimation indicates that , with currently available technique , high fidelities larger than the classical fidelity threshold 81.5 % are obtainable . our work provides some practical guidance for realization of efficient and faithful photon - echo - based memory for squeezed light .
