we present a simple cryostat purpose built for use with surface - electrode ion traps , designed around an affordable , large cooling power commercial pulse tube refrigerator . a modular vacuum enclosure with a single vacuum space facilitates interior access , and enables rapid turnaround and flexiblity for future modifications . long rectangular windows provide nearly 360 degrees of optical access in the plane of the ion trap , while a circular bottom window near the trap enables na 0.4 light collection without the need for in - vacuum optics . we evaluate the system 's mechanical and thermal characteristics , and we quantify ion trapping performance by trapping 40ca+ , finding small stray electric fields , long ion lifetimes , and low ion heating rates .
