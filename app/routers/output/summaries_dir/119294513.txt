we calculate an achievable secret key rate for quantum key distribution with a finite number of signals , by evaluating the min - entropy explicitly . the min - entropy can be expressed in terms of the guessing probability , which we calculate for d - dimensional systems . we compare these key rates to previous approaches using the von neumann entropy and find non - zero key rates for a smaller number of signals . furthermore , we improve the secret key rates by modifying the parameter estimation step . both improvements taken together lead to non - zero key rates for only 10 ^ 4 - 10 ^ 5 signals . an interesting conclusion can also be drawn from the additivity of the min - entropy and its relation to the guessing probability : for a set of symmetric tensor product states the optimal minimum - error discrimination ( med ) measurement is the optimal med measurement on each subsystem .
