we report an efficient energy - time entangled photon - pair source based on four - wave mixing in a cmos - compatible silicon photonics ring resonator . thanks to suitable optimization , the source shows a large spectral brightness of 400\,pairs of entangled photons /s / mhz for $ \rm 500\,\mu w$ pump power . additionally , the resonator has been engineered so as to generate a frequency comb structure compatible with standard telecom dense wavelength division multiplexers . we demonstrate high - purity energy - time entanglement , i.e. , free of photonic noise , with near perfect raw visibilities ( $ > $ ~98\% ) between various channel pairs in the telecom c - band . such a compact source stands as a path towards more complex quantum photonic circuits dedicated to quantum communication systems .
