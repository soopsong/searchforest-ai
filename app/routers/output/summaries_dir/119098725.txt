a classification of su(2)-invariant projected entangled paired states ( peps ) on the square lattice , based on a unique site tensor , has been recently introduced by mambrini et al.~\cite{mambrini2016 } . it is not clear whether such su(2)-invariant peps can either i ) exhibit long - range magnetic order ( like in the n\'eel phase ) or ii ) describe a genuine quantum critical point ( qcp ) or quantum critical phase ( qcph ) separating two ordered phases . here , we identify a specific family of su(2)-invariant peps of the classification which provides excellent variational energies for the $ j_1-j_2 $ frustrated heisenberg model , especially at $ j_2=0.5 $ , corresponding to the approximate location of the qcp or qcph separating the n\'eel phase from a dimerized phase . the peps are build from virtual states belonging to the $ \frac{1}{2}^{\otimes n } \oplus 0 $ su(2)-representation , i.e. with $ n$"colors"of virtual \hbox{spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ } . using a full update infinite - peps approach directly in the thermodynamic limit , based on the corner transfer matrix renormalization algorithm supplemented by a conjugate gradient optimization scheme , we provide evidence of i ) the absence of magnetic order and of ii ) diverging correlation lengths ( i.e. showing no sign of saturation with increasing environment dimension ) in both the singlet and triplet channels , when the number of colors $ n\ge 3$. we argue that such a peps gives a qualitative description of the qcp or qcph of the $ j_1-j_2 $ model .
