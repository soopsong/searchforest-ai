by reformulating the first law of thermodynamics in the fashion of quantum - mechanical operators on the parameter manifold , we propose a universal class of quantum heat engines ( qhe ) using the multilevel quantum system as the working substance . we obtain a general expression of work for the thermodynamic cycle with two thermodynamic adiabatic processes , which are implied in quantum adiabatic processes . we also classify the conditions for a 3-level qhe to extract positive work , which is proved to be looser than that for a 2-level system under certain conditions . as a realistic illustration , a 3-level atom system with dark state configuration manipulated by a classical radiation field is used to demonstrate our central idea .
