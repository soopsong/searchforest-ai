strong light - matter interactions enabled by surface plasmons have given rise to a wide range of photonic , optoelectronic and chemical functionalities . in recent years , the interest in this research area has focused on the quantum regime , aiming to developing ultra - compact nanoscale instruments operating at the single ( few ) photon(s ) level . in this perspective , we provide a general overview of recent experimental and theoretical advances as well as near - future challenges towards the design and implementation of plasmon - empowered quantum optical and photo - emitting devices based on the building blocks of nanophotonics technology : metallo - dielectric nanostructures and microscopic light sources .
