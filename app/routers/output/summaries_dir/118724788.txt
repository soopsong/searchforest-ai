we present a general method to detect nonclassical radiation fields with systems of on - off detectors . we especially study higher order correlations for the identification of nonclassical radiation . this allows us to directly characterize quantum correlations by the statistics measured with systems of on - off detectors . additionally , we generalize our method to multiple detector systems for measurements of correlations between light fields . we also consider multi - mode radiation fields and isolate nonclassicality in terms of the space time correlations . finally , we present results for the quantum statistics using on - off detectors operating in nonlinear detection modes .
