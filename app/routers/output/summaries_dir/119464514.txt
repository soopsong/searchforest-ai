the potential behind the horizon of an eternal black hole in classical theories is described in terms of data that is available to an external observer -- the reflection coefficient of a wave that scatters on the black hole . in gr and perturbative string theory ( in $ \alpha'$ ) , the potential is regular at the horizon and it blows up at the singularity . the exact reflection coefficient , that is known for the $ sl(2,\mathbb{r})_k / u(1)$ black hole and includes non - perturbative $ \alpha'$ effects , seems however to imply that there is a highly non - trivial structure just behind the horizon .
