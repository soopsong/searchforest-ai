the single - photon quantum filtering problems have been investigated recently with applications in quantum computing . in practice , the detector responds with a quantum efficiency of less than unity since there exists some mode mismatch between the detector and the system , and the single - photon signal may be corrupted by quantum white noise . consequently , quantum filters based on multiple measurements are designed in this paper to improve the estimation performance . more specifically , the filtering equations for a two - level quantum system driven by a single - photon input state and under multiple measurements are presented in this paper . four scenarios , 1 ) two diffusive measurements with q - p quadrature form , 2 ) two diffusive measurements with q - q quadrature form , 3 ) diffusive plus poissonian measurements , and 4 ) two poissonian measurements , are considered . it is natural to compare the filtering results , i.e. , measuring single channel or both channels , which one is better ? by the simulation where we use a single photon to excite an atom , it seems that multiple measurements enable us to excite the atom with higher probability than only measuring single channel . in addition , measurement back - action phenomenon is revealed by the simulation results .
