we re - analyse the optomechanical interferometer experiment proposed by marshall , simon , penrose and bouwmeester with the help of a recently developed quantum - classical hybrid theory . this leads to an alternative evaluation of the mirror induced decoherence . surprisingly , we find that it behaves essentially in the same way for suitable initial conditions and experimentally relevant parameters , no matter whether the mirror is considered a classical or quantum mechanical object . we discuss the parameter ranges where this result holds and possible implications for a test of spontaneous collapse models , for which this experiment has been designed .
