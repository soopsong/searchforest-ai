quantum key distribution ( qkd ) based on entangled photon pairs holds the potential for repeater - based quantum networks connecting clients over long distance . we demonstrate long - distance entanglement distribution by means of polarisation - entangled photon pairs through two successive deployed 96 km - long telecommunications fibres in the same submarine cable . one photon of each pair was detected directly after the source , while the other travelled the fibre cable in both directions for a total distance of 192 km and attenuation of 48 db . the observed two - photon bell state exhibited a fidelity 85 % $ \pm$ 2 % and was stable over several hours . we employed neither active stabilisation of the quantum state nor chromatic dispersion compensation for the fibre .
