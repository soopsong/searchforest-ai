geometric discord , a measure of quantumness of bipartite system , captures minimal nonlocal effects of a quantum state due to locally invariant von neumann projective measurements . original version of this measure is suffered by the local ancilla problem . in this article , we propose a new version of geometric discord using affinity . this quantity satisfies all criteria of a good measure of quantum correlation of the bipartite system and resolves local ancilla problem of hilbert - schmidt norm based discord . we evaluate analytically the proposed quantity for both pure and mixed states . for an arbitrary pure state , it is shown that affinity based geometric discord equal to geometric measure of entanglement . further , we obtain a lower bound of this measure for m \times n dimensional arbitrary mixed state and a closed formula of proposed version of geometric discord for 2 \times n dimensional mixed state is obtained . finally , as an illustration , we have studied the nonlocality of bell diagonal state , isotropic and werner states .
