we reveal the emergence of environment - induced spontaneous synchronization between two spin-1/2 quantum objects in a collision model setting . in particular , we determine the conditions for the dynamical establishment of synchronous evolution between local spin observables of a pair of spins undergoing open - system dynamics in the absence of an external drive . exploiting the versatility of the collision model framework , we show that the formation of quantum or classical correlations between the principal spin pair are of no significant relevance to the manifestation of spontaneous quantum synchronization between them . furthermore , we discuss the consequences of thermal effects on the environmental spins for the emergence of quantum synchronization .
