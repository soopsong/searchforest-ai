we present a novel continuous - time control strategy to exponentially stabilize an eigenstate of a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement operator . in open - loop , the system converges to a random eigenstate of the measurement operator . the role of the feedback is to prepare a prescribed qnd eigenstate with unit probability . to achieve this we introduce the use of brownian motion to drive the unitary control actions ; the feedback loop just adapts the amplitude of this brownian noise input as a function of the system state . essentially , it"shakes"the system away from undesired eigenstates by applying strong noise there , while relying on the open - loop dynamics to progressively reach the target . we prove exponential convergence towards the target eigenstate using standard stochastic lyapunov methods . the feedback scheme and its stability analysis suggest the use of an approximate filter which only tracks the populations of the eigenstates of the measurement operator . such reduced filters should play an increasing role towards advanced quantum technologies .
