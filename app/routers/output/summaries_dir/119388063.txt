in this paper , different from the other existing methods that only the special and limited numbers of qubits transmit between alice and bob , a general method is proposed to implement bidirectional quantum controlled / uncontrolled teleportation ( bqct / bqt ) that alice and bob can transmit each type of arbitrary n and m - qubits to each other , simultaneously . this protocol is based on controlled - not ( cnot ) operation , appropriate single - qubit unitary operations and single - qubit measurement in the z - basis and x - basis . also , the quantum channel can be created by using hadamard and cnot operations . one of the advantages of this method is using the single - qubit measurements which are more efficient than two - qubit measurements .
