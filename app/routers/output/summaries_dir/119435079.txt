we report measurements of time - frequency entangled photon pairs and heralded single photons at 1550~nm wavelengths generated using a microring resonator pumped optically by a diode laser . along with a high spectral brightness of pair generation , the conventional metrics used to describe performance , such as coincidences - to - accidentals ratio ( car ) , conditional self - correlation [ $ g^{(2)}(0)$ ] , two - photon energy - time { f}ranson interferometric visibility etc . are shown to reach a high - performance regime not yet achieved by silicon photonics , and attained previously only by crystal , glass and fiber - based pair - generation devices .
