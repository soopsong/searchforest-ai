entanglement , one of the central mysteries of quantum mechanics , plays an essential role in numerous applications of quantum information theory . a natural question of both theoretical and experimental importance is whether universal entanglement detection is possible without full state tomography . in this work , we prove a no - go theorem that rules out this possibility for any non - adaptive schemes that employ single - copy measurements only . we also examine in detail a previously implemented experiment , which claimed to detect entanglement of two - qubit states via adaptive single - copy measurements without full state tomography . by performing the experiment and analyzing the data , we demonstrate that the information gathered is indeed sufficient to reconstruct the state . these results reveal a fundamental limit for single - copy measurements in entanglement detection , and provides a general framework to study the detection of other interesting properties of quantum states , such as the positivity of partial transpose and the $ k$-symmetric extendibility .
