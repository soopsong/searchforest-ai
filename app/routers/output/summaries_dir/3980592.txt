we consider a distributed system with identical agents , constant - spacing policy and asymmetric bidirectional control , where the asymmetry is due to different controllers , which we describe by transfer functions . by applying the wave transfer function approach , it is shown that , if there are two integrators in the dynamics of agents , then the positional coupling must be symmetric , otherwise the system is locally string unstable . this finding holds also for a distributed system with a generalized path - graph interaction topology due to the local nature of the wave transfer function . the main advantage of the transfer function approach is that it allows us to analyse the bidirectional control with an arbitrary complex asymmetry in the controllers , for instance , the control with symmetric positional but asymmetric velocity couplings .
