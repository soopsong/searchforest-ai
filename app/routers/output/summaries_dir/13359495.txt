we present a heralded photon source based only on linear optics and weak coherent states . by time - tuning a hong - ou - mandel interferometer fed with frequency - displaced coherent states , the output photons can be synchronously heralded following sub - poisson statistics , which is indicated by the second - order correlation function ( $ g^2\left(0\right)=0.556 $ ) . the absence of phase - matching restrictions makes the source widely tunable , with 100-nm spectral tunability on the telecom bands . the technique presents yield comparable to state - of - the - art spontaneous parametric down - conversion - based sources , with high coherence and fiber - optic quantum communication compatibility .
