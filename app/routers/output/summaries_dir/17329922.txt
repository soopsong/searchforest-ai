we develop an approach to the deformation quantization on the real plane with an arbitrary poisson structure which based on weyl symmetrically ordered operator products . by using a polydifferential representation for deformed coordinates $ \hat x^j$ we are able to formulate a simple and effective iterative procedure which allowed us to calculate the fourth order star product ( and may be extended to the fifth order at the expense of tedious but otherwise straightforward calculations ) . modulo some cohomology issues which we do not consider here , the method gives an explicit and physics - friendly description of the star products .
