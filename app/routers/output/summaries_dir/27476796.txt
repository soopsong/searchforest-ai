we investigate decoherence channels that are modelled as a sequence of collisions of a quantum system ( e.g. , a qubit ) with particles ( e.g. , qubits ) of the environment . we show that collisions induce decoherence when a bi - partite interaction between the system qubit and an environment ( reservoir ) qubit is described by the controlled - u unitary transformation ( gate ) . we characterize decoherence channels and in the case of a qubit we specify the most general decoherence channel and derive a corresponding master equation . finally , we analyze entanglement that is generated during the process of decoherence between the system and its environment .
