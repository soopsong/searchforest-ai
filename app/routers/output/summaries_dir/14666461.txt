the theory of interactions between lasers and cold trapped ions as it pertains to the design of cirac - zoller quantum computers is discussed . the mean positions of the trapped ions , the eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the ions ' oscillations , the magnitude of the rabi frequencies for both allowed and forbidden internal transitions of the ions and the validity criterion for the required hamiltonian are calculated . energy level data for a variety of ion species is also presented .
