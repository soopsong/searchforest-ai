the quantum - mechanical and thermodynamic properties of a three - level molecular cooling cycle are derived . an inadequacy of earlier models is rectified in accounting for the spontaneous emission and absorption associated with the coupling to the coherent driving field via an environmental reservoir . this additional coupling need not be dissipative , and can provide a thermal driving force - the quantum analog of classical absorption chillers . the dependence of the maximum attainable cooling rate on temperature , at ultralow temperatures , is determined and shown to respect the recently established fundamental bound based on the second and third laws of thermodynamics .
