mobile light scatterers in a high - q optical cavity transversely illuminated by laser light close to a cavity resonance form ordered patterns , which maximize light scattering into the cavity and induce optical self - trapping . we show that a generalized form of such crystallization dynamics appears in multicolored pump fields with several cavity modes . here the particles arrange in spatial patterns maximizing total light collection into the resonator . for changing input frequencies and strengths the particles dynamically adapt to the current illumination . interestingly the system keeps some memory on past configurations , so that a later renewed application of the same pattern exhibits faster adaptation towards optimal collective scattering . in a noisy environment particles explore larger regions of configuration space spending most of the time close to optimum scattering configurations . this adaptive self - ordering dynamics should be implementable in a wide range of systems ranging from cold atoms in multimode cavities or nano - fiber traps to molecules or mobile nano - particles within an optical resonator .
