we propose an architecture based on superconducting qubits and resonators for the implementation of a variety of exotic lattice systems , such as spin and hubbard models in higher or fractal dimensions and higher - genus topologies . spin systems are realized naturally using qubits , while superconducting resonators can be used for the realization of bose - hubbard models . fundamental requirements for these designs , such as controllable interactions between arbitrary qubit pairs , have recently been implemented in the laboratory , rendering our proposals feasible with current technology .
