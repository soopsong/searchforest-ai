we demonstrate a polarization - entangled photon - pair source obtained via a type - ii non - collinear quasi - phase - matched spontaneous parametric down - conversion process with a 10-mm periodically poled ktiopo$_4 $ crystal , which is as stable and wavelength - tunable as the well - known sagnac configuration scheme . a brightness of 4.2 khz / mw is detected and a concurrence of 0.975 is estimated using quantum state tomography . without loss of entanglement and brightness , the photon - pair wavelengths are tunable through control of the crystal temperature . this improvement is achieved using the non - collinear configuration and a stable interferometric distinguishability compensator .
