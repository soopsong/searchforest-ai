we study shape - deformations of the entanglement entropy and the modular hamiltonian for an arbitrary subregion and state ( with a smooth dual geometry ) in a holographic conformal field theory . more precisely , we study a double - deformation comprising of a shape deformation together with a state deformation , where the latter corresponds to a small change in the bulk geometry . using a purely gravitational identity from the hollands - iyer - wald formalism together with the assumption of equality between bulk and boundary modular flows for the original , undeformed state and subregion , we rewrite a purely cft expression for this double deformation of the entropy in terms of bulk gravitational variables and show that it precisely agrees with the ryu - takayanagi formula including quantum corrections . as a corollary , this gives a novel , cft derivation of the jlms formula for arbitrary subregions in the vacuum , without using the replica trick . finally , we use our results to give an argument that if a general , asymptotically ads spacetime satisfies the ryu - takayanagi formula for arbitrary subregions , then it must necessarily satisfy the non - linear einstein equation .
