according to the quantum de finetti theorem , if the state of an n - partite system is invariant under permutations of the subsystems then it can be approximated by a state where almost all subsystems are identical copies of each other , provided n is sufficiently large compared to the dimension of the subsystems . the de finetti theorem has various applications in physics and information theory , where it is for instance used to prove the security of quantum cryptographic schemes . here , we extend de finetti 's theorem , showing that the approximation also holds for infinite dimensional systems , as long as the state satisfies certain experimentally verifiable conditions . this is relevant for applications such as quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , where it is often hard - or even impossible - to bound the dimension of the information carriers ( which may be corrupted by an adversary ) . in particular , our result can be applied to prove the security of qkd based on weak coherent states or gaussian states against general attacks .
