we address the system - reservoir dynamics of classical and quantum correlations in the decoherence phenomenon , regarding a two qubit composite system interacting with two independent environments . the most common noise channels ( amplitude damping , phase damping , bit flip , bit - phase flip , and phase flip ) was studied . by analytical and numerical analysis we found that , contrary to what is usually stated in the literature , decoherence may occurs without entanglement between the system and the environment . we also found that , in some cases , the bipartite quantum correlation initially presented in the system is completely evaporated , it is not transferred to the environments .
