the qubit swap gate has been shown to be an integral component of quantum circuitry design . it permutes the states of two qubits and allows for the storage quantum information , teleportation of atomic or ionic states , and is a fundamental element in the circuit implementation of shor 's algorithm . we consider the problem of generalising the swap gate beyond the qubit setting . we show that quantum circuit architectures completely described by instances of the cnot gate can not implement a transposition of a pair of qudits for dimensions $ d \equiv 3 ( mod 4)$. the task of constructing generalised swap gates based on transpositions of qudit states is argued in terms of the signature of a permutation .
