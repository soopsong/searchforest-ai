temporal steering , which is a temporal analogue of einstein - podolsky - rosen steering , refers to temporal quantum correlations between the initial and final state of a quantum system . our analysis of temporal steering inequalities in relation to the average quantum bit error rates reveals the interplay between temporal steering and quantum cloning , which guarantees the security of quantum key - distribution based on mutually - unbiased bases against individual attacks . the key distributions analyzed here include the bennett - brassard 1984 protocol ( bb84 ) and the six - state 1998 protocol by bruss ( b98 ) . moreover , we define a temporal steerable weight , which enables us to identify a kind of monogamy of temporal correlations that is essential to quantum cryptography and useful for analyzing various scenarios of quantum causality .
