we study the generalization of the qmupl model which accounts both for memory and dissipative effects . this is the first model where both features are combined . after having derived the non - local action describing the system , we solve the equation for a quantum harmonic oscillator via the path integral formalism . we give the explicit expression for the green 's function of the process . we focus on the case of an exponential correlation function and we analyze in detail the behavior gaussian wave functions . we eventually study the collapse process , comparing the results with those of previous models .
