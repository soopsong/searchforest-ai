we present a quantum algorithm for calculating the vibronic spectrum of a molecule , a useful but classically hard problem in chemistry . we show several advantages over previous quantum approaches : vibrational anharmonicity is naturally included ; after measurement , some state information is preserved for further analysis ; and there are potential error - related benefits . considering four triatomic molecules , we numerically study truncation errors in the harmonic approximation . further , in order to highlight the fact that our quantum algorithm 's primary advantage over classical algorithms is in simulating anharmonic spectra , we consider the anharmonic vibronic spectrum of sulfur dioxide . in the future , our approach could aid in the design of materials with specific light - harvesting and energy transfer properties , and the general strategy is applicable to other spectral calculations in chemistry and condensed matter physics .
