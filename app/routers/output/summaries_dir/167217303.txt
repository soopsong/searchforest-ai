quantum measurements play a fundamental role in quantum mechanics and quantum information processing , but it is not easy to implement generalized measurements , the most powerful measurements allowed by quantum mechanics . here we propose a simple recipe for implementing generalized measurements on a qudit via quantum walks . with this recipe , any discrete quantum measurement can be implemented via a one - dimensional discrete quantum walk ; the number of steps is only two times the number of measurement outcomes . as an illustration , we present a unified solution for implementing arbitrary symmetric informationally complete measurements in dimension 3 .
