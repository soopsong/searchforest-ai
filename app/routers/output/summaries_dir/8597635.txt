in quantum engineering , faults may occur in a quantum control system , which will cause the quantum control system unstable or deteriorate other relevant performance of the system . this note presents an estimator - based fault - tolerant control design approach for a class of linear quantum stochastic systems subject to fault signals . in this approach , the fault signals and some commutative components of the quantum system observables are estimated , and a fault - tolerant controller is designed to compensate the effect of the fault signals . numerical procedures are developed for controller design and an example is presented to demonstrate the proposed design approach .
