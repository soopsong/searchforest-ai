efficient sources of many - partite non - classical states are key for the advancement of quantum technologies and for the fundamental testing of quantum mechanics . we demonstrate the generation of time - correlated photon triplets at telecom wavelengths via pulsed cascaded parametric down - conversion in a monolithically integrated source . by detecting the generated states with success probabilities of $ ( 6.25\pm1.09)\times10^{-11}$ per pump pulse at injected powers as low as $ 10\;\mu\mathrm{w}$ , we benchmark the efficiency of the complete system and deduce its high potential for scalability . our source is unprecedentedly long - term stable , it overcomes interface losses intrinsically due to its monolithic architecture , and the photon - triplet states dominate uncorrelated noise significantly . these results mark crucial progress towards the proliferation of robust , scalable , synchronized and miniaturized quantum technology .
