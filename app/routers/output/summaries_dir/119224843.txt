the physical process version of the first law for black holes states that the passage of energy and angular momentum through the horizon results in a change in area $ \frac{\kappa}{8 \pi } \delta a = \delta e - \omega \delta j$ , so long as this passage is quasi - stationary . a similar physical process first law can be derived for any bifurcate killing horizon in any spacetime dimension $ d \ge 3 $ using much the same argument . however , to make this law non - trivial , one must show that sufficiently quasi - stationary processes do in fact occur . in particular , one must show that processes exist for which the shear and expansion remain small , and in which no new generators are added to the horizon . thorne , macdonald , and price considered related issues when an object falls across a d=4 black hole horizon . by generalizing their argument to arbitrary $ d \ge 3 $ and to any bifurcate killing horizon , we derive a condition under which these effects are controlled and the first law applies . in particular , by providing a non - trivial first law for rindler horizons , our work completes the parallel between the mechanics of such horizons and those of black holes for $ d \ge 3$. we also comment on the situation for d=2 .
