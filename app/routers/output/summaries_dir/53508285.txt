quantum markovian systems , modeled as unitary dilations in the quantum stochastic calculus of hudson and parthasarathy , have become standard in current quantum technological applications . this paper investigates the stability theory of such systems . lyapunov - type conditions in the heisenberg picture are derived in order to stabilize the evolution of system operators as well as the underlying dynamics of the quantum states . in particular , using the quantum markov semigroup associated with this quantum stochastic differential equation , we derive sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of a unique and faithful invariant quantum state . furthermore , this paper proves the quantum invariance principle , which extends the lasalle invariance principle to quantum systems in the heisenberg picture . these results are formulated in terms of algebraic constraints suitable for engineering quantum systems that are used in coherent feedback networks .
