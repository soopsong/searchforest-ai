the integrated optical circuit is a promising architecture for the realization of complex quantum optical states and information networks . one element that is required for many of these applications is a high - efficiency photon detector capable of photon - number discrimination . we present an integrated photonic system in the telecom band at 1550 nm based on uv - written silica - on - silicon waveguides and modified transition - edge sensors capable of number resolution and over 40 % efficiency . exploiting the mode transmission failure of these devices , we multiplex three detectors in series to demonstrate a combined 79 % + /- 2 % detection efficiency with a single pass , and 88 % + /- 3 % at the operating wavelength of an on - chip terminal reflection grating . furthermore , our optical measurements clearly demonstrate no significant unexplained loss in this system due to scattering or reflections . this waveguide and detector design therefore allows the placement of number - resolving single - photon detectors of predictable efficiency at arbitrary locations within a photonic circuit - a capability that offers great potential for many quantum optical applications .
