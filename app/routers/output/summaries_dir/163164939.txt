the recent progress in the physical realization of quantum computers ( the first publicly available ones -- ibm 's qx architectures -- have been launched in 2017 ) has motivated research on automatic methods that aid users in running quantum circuits on them . here , certain physical constraints given by the architectures which restrict the allowed interactions of the involved qubits have to be satisfied . thus far , this has been addressed by inserting swap and h operations . however , it remains unknown whether existing methods add a minimum number of swap and h operations or , if not , how far they are away from that minimum -- an np - complete problem . in this work , we address this by formulating the mapping task as a symbolic optimization problem that is solved using reasoning engines like boolean satisfiability solvers . by this , we do not only provide a method that maps quantum circuits to ibm 's qx architectures with a minimal number of swap and h operations , but also show by experimental evaluation that the number of operations added by ibm 's heuristic solution exceeds the lower bound by more than 100 % on average . an implementation of the proposed methodology is publicly available at http://iic.jku.at/eda/research/ibm_qx_mapping .
