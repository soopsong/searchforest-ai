we study how complexity classes above bqp , such as postbqp , $ { \rm postbqp}_{\rm fp}$ , and sbqp , change if we"merlinize"them , i.e. , if we allow an extra input quantum state ( or classical bit string ) given by merlin as witness . main results are the following three : first , the merlinized version of postbqp is equal to pspace . second , if the merlinized postbqp is restricted in such a way that the postselection probability is equal to all witness states , then the class is equal to pp . finally , the merlinization does not change the class sbqp .
