we define formally decohered quantum computers ( using density matrices ) , and present a simulation of them by a probabalistic classical turing machine . we study the slowdown of the simulation for two cases : ( 1 ) sequential quantum computers , or quantum turing machines(qtm ) , and ( 2 ) parallel quantum computers , or quantum circuits . this paper shows that the computational power of decohered quantum computers depends strongly on the amount of parallelism in the computation . the expected slowdown of the simulation of a qtm is polynomial in time and space of the quantum computation , for any non zero decoherence rate . this means that a qtm subjected to any amount of noise is worthless . for decohered quantum circuits , the situation is more subtle and depends on the decoherence rate , eta . we find that our simulation is efficient for circuits with decoherence rate higher than some constant , but exponential for general circuits with decoherence rate lower than some other constant . using computer experiments , we show that the transition from exponential cost to polynomial cost happens in a short range of decoherence rates , and exhibit the phase transitions in various quantum circuits .
