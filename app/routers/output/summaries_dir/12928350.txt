a pure - loss bosonic channel is a simple model for communication over free - space or fiber - optic links . more generally , phase - insensitive bosonic channels model other kinds of noise , such as thermalizing or amplifying processes . recent work has established the classical capacity of all of these channels , and furthermore , it is now known that a strong converse theorem holds for the classical capacity of these channels under a particular photon number constraint . the goal of the present paper is to initiate the study of second - order coding rates for these channels , by beginning with the simplest one , the pure - loss bosonic channel . in a second - order analysis of communication , one fixes the tolerable error probability and seeks to understand the back - off from capacity for a sufficiently large yet finite number of channel uses . we find a lower bound on the maximum achievable code size for the pure - loss bosonic channel , in terms of the known expression for its capacity and a quantity called channel dispersion . we accomplish this by proving a general"one - shot"coding theorem for channels with classical inputs and pure - state quantum outputs which reside in a separable hilbert space . the theorem leads to an optimal second - order characterization when the channel output is finite - dimensional , and it remains an open question to determine whether the characterization is optimal for the pure - loss bosonic channel .
