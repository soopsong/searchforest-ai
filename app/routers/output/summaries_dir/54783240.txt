with the rapid progress made by industry and academia , quantum computers with dozens of qubits or even larger size are being realized . however , the fidelity of existing quantum computers often sharply decreases as the circuit depth increases . thus , an ideal quantum circuit simulator on classical computers , especially on high - performance computers , is needed for benchmarking and validation . we design a large - scale simulator of universal random quantum circuits , often called ' quantum supremacy circuits ' , and implement it on sunway taihulight . the simulator can be used to accomplish the following two tasks : 1 ) computing a complete output state - vector ; 2 ) calculating one or a few amplitudes . we target the simulation of 49-qubit circuits . for task 1 ) , we successfully simulate such a circuit of depth 39 , and for task 2 ) we reach the 55-depth level . to the best of our knowledge , both of the simulation results reach the largest depth for 49-qubit quantum supremacy circuits .
