performing experiments on small - scale quantum computers is certainly a challenging endeavor . many parameters need to be optimized to achieve high - fidelity operations . this can be done efficiently for operations acting on single qubits as errors can be fully characterized . for multi - qubit operations , though , this is no longer the case as in the most general case analyzing the effect of the operation on the system requires a full state tomography for which resources scale exponentially with the system size . furthermore , in recent experiments additional electronic levels beyond the two - level system encoding the qubit have been used to enhance the capabilities of quantum information processors , which additionally increases the number of parameters that need to be controlled . for the optimization of the experimental system for a given task ( e.g.~a quantum algorithm ) , one has to find a satisfactory error model and also efficient observables to estimate the parameters of the model . in this manuscript we demonstrate a method to optimize the encoding procedure for a small quantum error correction code in the presence of unknown but constant phase shifts . the method , which we implement here on a small - scale linear ion - trap quantum computer , is readily applicable to other amo platforms for quantum information processing .
