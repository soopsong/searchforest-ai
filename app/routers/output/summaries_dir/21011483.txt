we report measurements of two - photon interference using a cw - pumped type - ii spontaneous parametric down - conversion source based on a multimode perodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate waveguide . we have used the recently demonstrated technique of controlling the spatial characteristics of the down - conversion process via intermodal dispersion to generate photon pairs in fundamental transverse modes , thus ensuring their spatial indistinguishability . good spatial overlap of photon modes within pairs has been verified using the hong - ou - mandel interferometer and the preparation of polarization entanglement in the shih - alley configuration , yielding visibilities consistently above 90 % .
