in this paper , we theoretically propose and investigate a feasible experimental scheme for realizing the dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) of phonons in an optomechanical setup formed by a ground - state precooled mechanical oscillator ( mo ) inside a fabry - p{\'e}rot cavity , which is driven by an amplitude - modulated classical laser field in the dispersive ( far - detuned ) regime . the time modulation of the driving field leads to the parametric amplification of the mechanical vacuum fluctuations of the mo , which results in the generation of casimir phonons over time scales longer than the cavity lifetime . we show that the generated phonons exhibit quadrature squeezing , bunching effect , and super - poissonian statistics which are controllable by the externally modulated laser pump . in particular , we find that the scheme allows for a perfect squeezing transfer from one mechanical quadrature to another when the laser frequency is varied from red detuning to blue detuning . moreover , by analyzing the effect of the thermal noise of the mo environment , we find that there exists a critical temperature above which there is no phonon quadrature squeezing to occur . we also show that in the presence of time modulation of the driving laser the linewidth narrowing of the displacement spectrum of the mo can be considered as a signature of the generation of casimir phonons .
