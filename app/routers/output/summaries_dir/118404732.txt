by using transitionless quantum driving algorithm ( tqda ) , we present an efficient scheme for the shortcuts to the holonomic quantum computation ( hqc ) . it works in decoherence - free subspace ( dfs ) and the adiabatic process can be speeded up in the shortest possible time . more interestingly , we give a physical implementation for our shortcuts to hqc with nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamonds dispersively coupled to a whispering - gallery mode microsphere cavity . it can be efficiently realized by controlling appropriately the frequencies of the external laser pulses . also , our scheme has good scalability with more qubits . different from previous works , we first use tqda to realize a universal hqc in dfs , including not only two noncommuting accelerated single - qubit holonomic gates but also a accelerated two - qubit holonomic controlled - phase gate , which provides the necessary shortcuts for the complete set of gates required for universal quantum computation . moreover , our experimentally realizable shortcuts require only two - body interactions , not four - body ones , and they work in the dispersive regime , which relax greatly the difficulty of their physical implementation in experiment . our numerical calculations show that the present scheme is robust against decoherence with current experimental parameters .
