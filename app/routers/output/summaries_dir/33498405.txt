we analyse an ambiguity in previous works on entanglement of fermionic fields in non - inertial frames . this ambiguity , related to the anticommutation properties of field operators , leads to non - unique results when computing entanglement measures for the same state . we show that the ambiguity disappears when we introduce detectors , which are in any case necessary as a means to probe the field entanglement .
