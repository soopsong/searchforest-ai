we apply the bit thread formulation of holographic entanglement entropy to reduced states describing only the geometry contained within an entanglement wedge . we argue that a certain optimized bit thread configuration , which we construct , gives a purification of the reduced state to a full holographic state obeying a precise set of conditional mutual information relations . when this purification exists , we establish , under certain assumptions , the conjectured $ e_p = e_w$ relation equating the entanglement of purification with the area of the minimal cross section partitioning the bulk entanglement wedge . along the way , we comment on minimal purifications of holographic states , geometric purifications , and black hole geometries .
