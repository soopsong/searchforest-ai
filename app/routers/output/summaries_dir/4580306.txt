levitated diamond nanocrystals with nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centres in high vacuum have been proposed as a unique system for experiments in fundamental quantum mechanics , including the generation of large quantum superposition states and tests of quantum gravity . this system promises extreme isolation from its environment while providing quantum control and sensing through the nv centre spin . while optical trapping has been the most explored method of levitation , recent results indicate that excessive optical heating of the nanodiamonds under vacuum may make the method impractical with currently available materials . here , we study an alternative magneto - gravitational trap for diamagnetic particles , such as diamond nanocrystals , with stable levitation from atmospheric pressure to high vacuum . magnetic field gradients from permanent magnets confine the particle in two dimensions , while confinement in the third dimension is gravitational . we demonstrate that feedback cooling of the centre - of - mass motion of a trapped nanodiamond cluster results in cooling of one degree of freedom to less than 1 k.
