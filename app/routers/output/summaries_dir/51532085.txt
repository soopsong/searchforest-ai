we introduce several classes of quantum combinatorial designs , namely quantum latin squares , cubes , hypercubes and a notion of orthogonality between them . a further introduced notion , quantum orthogonal arrays , generalizes all previous classes of designs . we show that mutually orthogonal quantum latin arrangements can be entangled in the same way than quantum states are entangled . furthermore , we show that such designs naturally define a remarkable class of genuinely multipartite highly entangled states called $ k$-uniform , i.e. multipartite pure states such that every reduction to $ k$ parties is maximally mixed . we derive infinitely many classes of mutually orthogonal quantum latin arrangements and quantum orthogonal arrays having an arbitrary large number of columns . the corresponding multipartite $ k$-uniform states exhibit a high persistency of entanglement , which makes them ideal candidates to develop multipartite quantum information protocols .
