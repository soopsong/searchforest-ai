phase - space distributions are widely applied in quantum optics to access the nonclassical features of radiations fields . in particular , the inability to interpret the glauber - sudarshan distribution in terms of a classical probability density is the fundamental benchmark for quantum light . however , this phase - space distribution can not be directly reconstructed for arbitrary states , because of its singular behavior . in this work , we perform a characterization of the glauber - sudarshan representation in terms of distribution theory . we address important features of such distributions : ( i ) the maximal degree of their singularities is studied , ( ii ) the ambiguity of representation is shown , and ( iii ) their dual space for nonclassicality tests is specified . in this view , we reconsider the methods for regularizing the glauber - sudarshan distribution for verifying its nonclassicality . this treatment is supported with comprehensive examples and counterexamples .
