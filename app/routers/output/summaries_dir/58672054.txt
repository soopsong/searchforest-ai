new classes of performance measures have been recently introduced to quantify the transient response to external disturbances of coupled dynamical systems on complex networks . these performance measures are time - integrated quadratic forms in the system 's coordinates or their time derivative . so far , investigations of these performance measures have been restricted to dirac-$\delta$ impulse disturbances , in which case they can be alternatively interpreted as giving the long time output variances for stochastic white noise power demand / generation fluctuations . strictly speaking , the approach is therefore restricted to power fluctuating on time scales shorter than the shortest time scales in the swing equations . to account for power productions from new renewable energy sources , we extend these earlier works to the relevant case of colored noise power fluctuations , with a finite correlation time $ \tau>0$. we calculate a closed - form expression for generic quadratic performance measures . applied to specific cases , this leads to a spectral representation of performance measures as a sum over the non - zero modes of the network laplacian . our results emphasize the competition between inertia , damping and the laplacian modes , whose balance is determined to a large extent by the noise correlation time scale $ \tau$.
