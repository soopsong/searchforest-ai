the concept of temperature in nonequilibrium thermodynamics is an outstanding theoretical issue . we propose an energy repartition principle that leads to a spectral ( mode - dependent ) temperature in steady - state nonequilibrium systems . the general concepts are illustrated by analytic solutions of the classical heisenberg spin chain connected to langevin heat reservoirs with arbitrary temperature profiles . gradients of external magnetic fields are shown to localize spin waves in a wannier - zeemann fashion , while magnon interactions renormalize the spectral temperature . our generic results are applicable to other thermodynamic systems such as newtonian liquids , elastic solids , and josephson junctions .
