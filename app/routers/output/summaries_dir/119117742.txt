the quantum fisher information and quantum correlation parameters are employed to study the application of non - classical light to the problem of parameter estimation . it is shown that the optimal measurement sensitivity of a quantum state is determined by its inter - mode correlations ( which depends of path - entanglement ) and intra - mode correlations ( which depends of the photon statistics ) . in light of these results , we consider the performance of quantum - enhanced optical interferometers . furthermore , we propose a heisenberg - limited metrology protocol involving standard elements from passive and active linear optics , for which the quantum cram\'{e}r - rao bound is saturated with an intensity measurement . interestingly , the quantum advantage for this scheme is derived solely from the non - classical photon statistics of the probe state and does not depend of entanglement . we study the performance of this scheme in the presence of realistic losses and consequently predict a substantial enhancement over the shot - noise limit with current technological capabilities .
