in this paper we present a compact source of narrow - band energy - time entangled photon pairs in the telecom regime based on a ti - indiffused periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) waveguide resonator , i.e. a waveguide with end - face dielectric multi - layer mirrors . this is a monolithic doubly resonant optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) far below threshold , which generates photon pairs by spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) at around 1560 nm with a 117mhz ( 0.91 pm)- bandwidth . a coherence time of 2.7 ns is estimated by a time correlation measurement and a high quality of the entangled states is confirmed by a bell - type experiment . since highly coherent energy - time entangled photon pairs in the telecom regime are suitable for long distance transmission and manipulation , this source is well suited to the requirements of quantum communication .
