recently it has been shown how the use of quantum entanglement can lead to the creation of real - time communication channels whose viability can be made location dependent . such functionality leads to new security paradigms that are not possible in classical communication networks . key to these new security paradigms are quantum protocols that can unconditionally determine that a receiver is in fact at an a priori assigned location . a limiting factor of such quantum protocols will be the decoherence of states held in quantum memory . here we investigate the performance of quantum location verification protocols under decoherence effects . more specifically , we address the issue of how decoherence impacts the verification using n = 2 qubits entangled as bell states , as compared to n>2 qubits entangled as ghz states . we study the original quantum location verification protocol , as well as a variant protocol , introduced here , which utilizes teleportation . we find that the performance of quantum location verification is in fact similar for bell states and some n>2 ghz states , even though quantum decoherence degrades larger - qubit entanglements faster . our results are important for the design and implementation of location - dependent communications in emerging quantum networks .
