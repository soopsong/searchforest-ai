we extend the concept of classicality in quantum optics to spin states . we call a state ` ` classical ' ' if its density matrix can be decomposed as a weighted sum of angular momentum coherent states with positive weights . classical spin states form a convex set c , which we fully characterize for a spin-1/2 and a spin-1 . for arbitrary spin , we provide ` ` non - classicality witnesses ' ' . for bipartite systems , c forms a subset of all separable states . a state of two spins-1/2 belongs to c if and only if it is separable , whereas for a spin-1/2 coupled to a spin-1 , there are separable states which do not belong to c. we show that in general the question whether a state is in c can be answered by a linear programming algorithm .
