the open - system dynamics of entanglement plays an important role in the assessment of the robustness of quantum information processes and also in the investigation of the classical limit of quantum mechanics . here we show that , subjacent to this dynamics , there is a subtle flow of quantum correlations . we use a recently proposed optical setup , which allows joint tomography of system and environment , to show that the decay of an initial bipartite entangled state leads to the build up of multipartite entanglement and quantum discord , the latter exhibiting a non - analytic behavior that signals the emergence of maximal genuine quantum entanglement . the origin of this analyticity is shown to be distinct from similar behavior previously found in bipartite systems . monogamy relations within the context of open - system dynamics explain this new phenomenon .
