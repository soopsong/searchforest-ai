private queries allow a user alice to learn an element of a database held by a provider bob without revealing which element she was interested in , while limiting her information about the other elements . we propose to implement private queries based on a quantum key distribution protocol , with changes only in the classical post - processing of the key . this approach makes our scheme both easy to implement and loss - tolerant . while unconditionally secure private queries are known to be impossible , we argue that an interesting degree of security can be achieved , relying on fundamental physical principles instead of unverifiable security assumptions in order to protect both user and database . we think that there is scope for such practical private queries to become another remarkable application of quantum information in the footsteps of quantum key distribution .
