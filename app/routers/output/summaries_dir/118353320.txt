in this paper we describe in detail and generalize a method for quantum process tomography that was presented in [ a. bendersky , f. pastawski , j. p. paz , physical review letters 100 , 190403 ( 2008 ) ] . the method enables the efficient estimation of any element of the $ \chi$--matrix of a quantum process . such elements are estimated as averages over experimental outcomes with a precision that is fixed by the number of repetitions of the experiment . resources required to implement it scale polynomically with the number of qubits of the system . the estimation of all diagonal elements of the $ \chi$--matrix can be efficiently done without any ancillary qubits . in turn , the estimation of all the off - diagonal elements requires an extra clean qubit . the key ideas of the method , that is based on efficient estimation by random sampling over a set of states forming a 2 - -design , are described in detail . efficient methods for preparing and detecting such states are explicitly shown .
