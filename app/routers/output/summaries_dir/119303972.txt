we study the entanglement entropy , $ s_c$ , of a massless free scalar field on the outside region $ c$ of two black holes $ a$ and $ b$ whose radii are $ r_1 $ and $ r_2 $ and how it depends on the distance , $ r(\gg r_1,r_2)$ , between two black holes . if we can consider the entanglement entropy as thermodynamic entropy , we can see the entropic force acting on the two black holes from the $ r$ dependence of $ s_c$. we develop the computational method based on that of bombelli et al to obtain the $ r$ dependence of $ s_c$ of scalar fields whose lagrangian is quadratic with respect to the scalar fields . first we study $ s_c$ in $ d+1 $ dimensional minkowski spacetime . in this case the state of the massless free scalar field is the minkowski vacuum state and we replace two black holes by two imaginary spheres , and we take the trace over the degrees of freedom residing in the imaginary spheres . we obtain the leading term of $ s_c$ with respect to $ 1 / r$. the result is $ s_c = s_a+s_b+\tfrac{1}{r^{2d-2 } } g(r_1,r_2)$ , where $ s_a$ and $ s_b$ are the entanglement entropy on the inside region of $ a$ and $ b$ , and $ g(r_1,r_2 ) \leq 0$. we do not calculate $ g(r_1,r_2)$ in detail , but we show how to calculate it . in the black hole case we use the method used in the minkowski spacetime case with some modifications . we show that $ s_c$ can be expected to be the same form as that in the minkowski spacetime case . but in the black hole case , $ s_a$ and $ s_b$ depend on $ r$ , so we do not fully obtain the $ r$ dependence of $ s_c$. finally we assume that the entanglement entropy can be regarded as thermodynamic entropy , and consider the entropic force acting on two black holes . we argue how to separate the entanglement entropic force from other force and how to cancel $ s_a$ and $ s_b$ whose $ r$ dependence are not obtained . then we obtain the physical prediction which can be tested experimentally in principle .
