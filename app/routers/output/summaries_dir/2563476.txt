we investigate the possibility of a dicke - type superradiant phase transition of an atomic gas with an extended model which takes into account the short - range depolarizing interactions between atoms approaching each other as close as the atomic size scale , which interaction appears in a regularized electric - dipole picture of the qed of atoms . by using a mean field model , we find that a critical density does indeed exist , though the atom - atom contact interaction shifts it to a higher value than it can be obtained from the bare dicke - model . we argue that the system , at the critical density , transitions to the condensed rather than the"superradiant"phase .
