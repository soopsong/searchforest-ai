variational quantum algorithms , a class of quantum heuristics , are promising candidates for the demonstration of useful quantum computation . finding the best way to amplify the performance of these methods on hardware is an important task . here , we evaluate the optimization of quantum heuristics with an existing class of techniques called ` meta - learners ' . we compare the performance of a meta - learner to bayesian optimization , evolutionary strategies , l - bfgs - b and nelder - mead approaches , for two quantum heuristics ( quantum alternating operator ansatz and variational quantum eigensolver ) , on three problems , in three simulation environments . we show that the meta - learner comes near to the global optima more frequently than all other optimizers we tested in a noisy parameter setting environment . we also find that the meta - learner is generally more resistant to noise , for example seeing a smaller reduction in performance in noisy and sampling environments and performs better on average by a ` gain ' metric than its closest comparable competitor l - bfgs - b . these results are an important indication that meta - learning and associated machine learning methods will be integral to the useful application of noisy near - term quantum computers .
