in ~ this paper , we construct noncommutative coherent states using various families of unitary irreducible representations ( uirs ) of $ \g$ , a connected , simply connected nilpotent lie group , that was identified as the kinematical symmetry group of noncommutative quantum mechanics for a system of 2-degrees of freedom in an earlier paper . likewise described are the degenerate noncommutative coherent states arising from the degenerate uirs of $ \g$. we ~ then compute the reproducing kernels associated with both these families of coherent states and study berezin - toeplitz quantization of the observables on the underlying 4-dimensional phase space , analyzing in particular the semi - classical asymptotics for both these cases .
