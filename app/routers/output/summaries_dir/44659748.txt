well characterized photon number resolving detectors are a requirement for many applications ranging from quantum information and quantum metrology to the foundations of quantum mechanics . this prompts the necessity for reliable calibration techniques at the single photon level . in this paper we propose an innovative absolute calibration technique for photon number resolving detectors , using a pulsed heralded photon source based on parametric down conversion . the technique , being absolute , does not require reference standards and is independent upon the performances of the heralding detector . the method provides the results of quantum efficiency for the heralded detector as a function of detected photon numbers . furthermore , we prove its validity by performing the calibration of a transition edge sensor based detector , a real photon number resolving detector that has recently demonstrated its effectiveness in various quantum information protocols .
