we present an idea to convert to a unitary quantum walk any open quantum walk which is defined on lattices as well as on finite graphs . this approach generalizes to the domain of open quantum walks ( or quantum markov chains ) the framework introduced by szegedy for quantizing markov chains . for the unitary quantum walks formulated in this article , we define the probability and the mean probability of finding the walk at a node , then derive the asymptotic mean probability .
