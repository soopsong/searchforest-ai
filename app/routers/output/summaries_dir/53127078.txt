we study the magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking in the abjm chern - simons matter theory with unquenched flavors in the veneziano limit . we consider a magnetized d6-brane probe in the background of a flavored black hole which includes the backreaction of massless smeared flavors in the abjm geometry . we find a holographic realization for the running of the quark mass due to the dynamical flavors . we compute several thermodynamic quantities of the brane probe and analyze the effects of the dynamical quarks on the fundamental condensate and on the phase diagram of the model . the dynamical flavors have an interesting effect on the magnetic catalysis . at zero temperature and fixed magnetic field , the magnetic catalysis is suppressed for small bare quark masses whereas it is enhanced for large values of the mass . when the temperature is non - zero there is a critical magnetic field , above which the magnetic catalysis takes place . this critical magnetic field decreases with the number of flavors , which we interpret as an enhancement of the catalysis .
