we observe -9.01+/-0.14 db of squeezing and +15.12+/-0.14 db of antisqueezing with a local oscillator phase locked in homodyne measurement . suzuki et al . have pointed out two main factors in [ appl . phys . lett . 89 , 061116 ( 2006 ) ] , which degrade the observed squeezing level : phase fluctuation in homodyne measurement and intracavity losses of an optical parametric oscillator for squeezing . we have improved the phase stability of homodyne measurement and have reduced the intracavity losses . we measure pump power dependences of the squeezing and antisqueezing levels , which show good agreement with theoretical calculations taking account of the phase fluctuation .
