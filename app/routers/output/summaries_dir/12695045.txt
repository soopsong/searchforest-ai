a quantum random number generator ( qrng ) can generate true randomness by exploiting the fundamental indeterminism of quantum mechanics . most approaches to qrng employ single - photon detection technologies and are limited in speed . here , we propose and experimentally demonstrate an ultrafast qrng at a rate over 6 gb / s based on the quantum phase fluctuations of a laser operating near threshold . moreover , we consider a potential adversary who has partial knowledge on the raw data and discuss how one can rigorously remove such partial knowledge with post - processing . we quantify the quantum randomness through min - entropy by modeling our system , and employ two extractors , trevisan 's extractor and toeplitz - hashing , to distill the randomness , which is information - theoretically provable . the simplicity and high - speed of our experimental setup show the feasibility of a robust , low - cost , high - speed qrng .
