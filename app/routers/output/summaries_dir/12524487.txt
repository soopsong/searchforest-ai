we consider bloch oscillations of ultracold atoms stored in a one - dimensional vertical optical lattice and simultaneously interacting with a unidirectionally pumped optical ring cavity whose vertical arm is collinear with the optical lattice . we find that the feedback provided by the cavity field on the atomic motion synchronizes bloch oscillations via a mode - locking mechanism , steering the atoms to the lowest bloch band . it also stabilizes bloch oscillations against noise , and even suppresses dephasing due to atom - atom interactions . furthermore , it generates periodic bursts of light emitted into the counter - propagating cavity mode , providing a non - destructive monitor of the atomic dynamics . all these features may be crucial for future improvements of the design of atomic gravimeters based on recording bloch oscillations .
