atom matterwave interferometry requires mirror and beamsplitter pulses that are robust to inhomogeneities in field intensity , magnetic environment , atom velocity and zeeman sub - state . pulse shapes determined using quantum control methods offer significantly improved interferometer performance by allowing broader atom distributions , larger interferometer areas and higher contrast . we have applied gradient ascent pulse engineering ( grape ) to optimise the design of phase - modulated mirror pulses for a mach - zehnder light - pulse atom interferometer , with the aim of increasing fringe contrast when averaged over atoms with an experimentally relevant range of velocities , beam intensities , and zeeman states . pulses were found to be highly robust to variations in detuning and coupling strength , and offer a clear improvement in robustness over the best established composite pulses . the peak mirror fidelity in a cloud of $ \sim 80\ \mu$k $ { } ^{85}$rb atoms is predicted to be improved by a factor of 2 compared with standard rectangular $ \pi$ pulses .
