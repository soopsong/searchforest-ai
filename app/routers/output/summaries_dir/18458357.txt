constructing a discrete model like a cellular automaton is a powerful method for understanding various dynamical systems . however , the relationship between the discrete model and its continuous analogue is , in general , nontrivial . as a quantum - mechanical cellular automaton , a discrete - time quantum walk is defined to include various quantum dynamical behavior . here we generalize a discrete - time quantum walk on a line into the feed - forward quantum coin model , which depends on the coin state of the previous step . we show that our proposed model has an anomalous slow diffusion characterized by the porous - medium equation , while the conventional discrete - time quantum walk model shows ballistic transport .
