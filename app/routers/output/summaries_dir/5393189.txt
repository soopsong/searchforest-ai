we study the problem of cooling a mechanical oscillator using the photothermal ( bolometric ) force . contrary to previous attempts to model this system , we take into account the noise effects due to the granular nature of photon absorption . this allows us to tackle the cooling problem down to the noise dominated regime and to find reasonable estimates for the lowest achievable phonon occupation in the cantilever .
