we examine quantum interference effects due to absorption and emission from multiple atoms coupled to a waveguide and highlight the modifications they entail in regards to single - photon transport properties . a prominent upshot of these interference phenomena is the resonant suppression of the reflection amplitude , which leads to the observation of multiple fano minima in the reflection spectrum . such minima determine the points at which transparency is induced in the system . by taking recourse to the real - space hamiltonian framework , we calculate analytically the reflectivity and transmissivity for a one - dimensional waveguide that evanescently couples to a chain of equally spaced quantum emitters . the inter - emitter spacing relative to the wavelength of the propagating photon , leading to a waveguide - mediated"phase - coupling"between the atoms , is found to fundamentally affect the existence of fano minima . for a chain of $ n$ atoms , the number of minima can be at most $ n-1$. however , suitable choices of the phase can suppress the discernibility of the full range of roots in the reflection spectrum . a principal observation for the case of multiple emitters is the emergence of super - gaussian characteristics close to zero - detuning and consequently , a plateau - shaped broadband spectrum in the region of high reflectivity . for a large chain size , the plateau gets transformed into a flat - topped quasi - rectangular profile in the frequency domain .
