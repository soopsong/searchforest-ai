we report an experimental realization of adaptive bayesian quantum state tomography for two - qubit states . our implementation is based on the adaptive experimental design strategy proposed in [ f.husz\'ar and n.m.t.houlsby , phys.rev.a 85 , 052120 ( 2012 ) ] and provides an optimal measurement approach in terms of the information gain . we address the practical questions , which one faces in any experimental application : the influence of technical noise , and behavior of the tomographic algorithm for an easy to implement class of factorized measurements . in an experiment with polarization states of entangled photon pairs we observe a lower instrumental noise floor and superior reconstruction accuracy for nearly - pure states of the adaptive protocol compared to a non - adaptive . at the same time we show , that for the mixed states the restriction to factorized measurements results in no advantage for adaptive measurements , so general measurements have to be used .
