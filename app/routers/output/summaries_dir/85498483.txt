integrated photonics is increasing in importance for compact , robust , and scalable enabling quantum technologies . this is particularly interesting for developing quantum communication networks , where resources need to be deployed in the field . we exploit photonic chip - based $ \rm si_3 n_4 $ ring microresonators for the generation of photon pairs with low - loss , high - noise suppression and coincidence rates of $ 80\times 10 ^ 3\,$s$^{-1}$. a simple photonic noise characterisation technique is presented that distinguishes linear and nonlinear contributions that is useful for system design and optimisation . we then demonstrate an all - fibre $ 750\,$mhz clock - rate sequential time - bin entanglement scheme with raw interference visibilities $ > \,98\,\%$.
