few - photon optomechanical effects are not only important physical evidences for understanding the radiation - pressure interaction between photons and mechanical oscillation , but also have wide potential applications in modern quantum technology . here we study the few - photon optomechanical effects including photon blockade and generation of the schr\"{o}dinger cat states under the assistance of a cross - kerr interaction , which is an inherent interaction accompanied the optomechanical coupling in a generalized optomechanical system . by exactly diagonalizing the generalized optomechanical hamiltonian and calculating its unitary evolution operator , we find the physical mechanism of the enhancement of photon blockade and single - photon mechanical displacement . the quantum properties in this generalized optomechanical system are studied by investigating the second - order correlation function of the cavity field and calculating the wigner function and the probability distribution of the rotated quadrature operator for the mechanical mode . we also study the influence of the dissipations on the few - photon optomechanical effects .
