we express modular and weak values of observables of three- and higher - level quantum systems in their polar form . the majorana representation of n - level systems in terms of symmetric states of n-1 qubits provides us with a description on the bloch sphere . with this geometric approach , we find that modular and weak values of observables of n - level quantum systems can be factored in n-1 contributions . their modulus is determined by the product of n-1 ratios involving projection probabilities between qubits , while their argument is deduced from a sum of n-1 solid angles on the bloch sphere . these theoretical results allow us to study the geometric origin of the quantum phase discontinuity around singularities of weak values in three - level systems . we also analyze the three - box paradox [ 1 ] from the point of view of a bipartite quantum system . in the majorana representation of this paradox , an observer comes to opposite conclusions about the entanglement state of the particles that were successfully pre- and postselected .
