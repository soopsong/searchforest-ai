we consider the phase - transition - like behaviour in the rabi model containing a single two - level system , or qubit , and a single harmonic oscillator . the system experiences a sudden transition from an uncorrelated state to an increasingly correlated one as the qubit - oscillator coupling strength is varied and increased past a critical point . this singular behaviour occurs in the limit where the oscillator 's frequency is much lower than the qubit 's frequency ; away from this limit one obtains a finite - width transition region . by analyzing the energy - level structure , the value of the oscillator field and its squeezing and the qubit - oscillator correlation , we gain insight into the nature of the transition and the associated critical behaviour .
