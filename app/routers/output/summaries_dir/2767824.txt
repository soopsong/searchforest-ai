we define some of the programming and system - level challenges facing the application of quantum processing to high - performance computing . alongside barriers to physical integration , prominent differences in the execution of quantum and conventional programs challenges the intersection of these computational models . following a brief overview of the state of the art , we discuss recent advances in programming and execution models for hybrid quantum - classical computing . we discuss a novel quantum - accelerator framework that uses specialized kernels to offload select workloads while integrating with existing computing infrastructure . we elaborate on the role of the host operating system to manage these unique accelerator resources , the prospects for deploying quantum modules , and the requirements placed on the language hierarchy connecting these different system components . we draw on recent advances in the modeling and simulation of quantum computing systems with the development of architectures for hybrid high - performance computing systems and the realization of software stacks for controlling quantum devices . finally , we present simulation results that describe the expected system - level behavior of high - performance computing systems composed from compute nodes with quantum processing units . we describe performance for these hybrid systems in terms of time - to - solution , accuracy , and energy consumption , and we use simple application examples to estimate the performance advantage of quantum acceleration .
