we propose a scheme for authentication of physical keys that are materialized by optical multiple - scattering media . the authentication relies on the optical response of the key when probed by randomly selected coherent states of light , and the use of standard wavefront - shaping techniques that direct the scattered photons coherently to a specific target mode at the output . the quadratures of the electromagnetic field of the scattered light at the target mode are analysed using a homodyne detection scheme , and the acceptance or rejection of the key is decided upon the outcomes of the measurements . the proposed scheme can be implemented with current technology and offers collision resistance and robustness against key cloning .
