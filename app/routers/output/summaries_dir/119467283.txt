quantum computation and quantum control operate by building unitary transformations out of sequences of elementary quantum logic operations or applications of control fields . this paper puts upper bounds on the minimum time required to implement a desired unitary transformation on a d - dimensional hilbert space when applying sequences of hamiltonian transformations . we show that strategies of building up a desired unitary out of non - infinitesimal and infinitesimal unitaries , or equivalently , using power and band limited controls , can yield the best possible scaling in time $ o(d^2)$.
