we analyze and evaluate perfect controlled teleportation via three - qubit entangled channels from the point of view of the controller . the key idea in controlled teleportation is that the teleportation is performed only with the participation of the controller . we calculate a quantitative measure of the controller 's power and establish a lower bound on the control power required for controlled teleportation . we show that the maximally entangled ghz state is a suitable channel for controlled teleportation of arbitrary single qubits - the controller 's power meets the bound and the teleportation fidelity without the controller 's permission is no better than the fidelity of a classical channel . we also construct partially entangled channels that exceed the bound for controlled teleportation of a restricted set of states called the equatorial states . we calculate the minimum entanglement required in these channels to exceed the bound . moreover , we find that in these restricted controlled teleportation schemes , the partially entangled channels can outperform maximally entangled channels with respect to the controller 's power . our results provide a new perspective on controlled teleportation schemes and are of practical interest since we propose useful partially entangled channels .
