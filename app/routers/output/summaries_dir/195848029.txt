the use of the adiabatic approximation in practical applications , as in adiabatic quantum computation , demands an assessment of the errors made in finite - time evolutions . aiming at such scenarios , we derive bounds relating error and evolution time in the adiabatic approximation that go beyond typical scaling relations . using the adiabatic perturbation theory , we obtain leading - order expressions valid for long evolution time $ t$ , while explicitly determining the shortest time $ t$ and the largest error $ \varepsilon$ for which they are valid . restricting our considerations to this validity regime , we can make clear and precise statements about the evolution time necessary to reach a given error and vice - versa . as an example of practical importance , we apply these results to the adiabatic version of grover 's quantum search algorithm and obtain highly accurate trade - off relations between run time and error for several evolution schedules . their examination indicates that different strategies are required to optimize for either shorter time or minimal error .
