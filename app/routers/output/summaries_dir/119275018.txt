the ability to manipulate electron spins with voltage - dependent electric fields is key to the operation of quantum spintronics devices , such as spin - based semiconductor qubits . a natural approach to electrical spin control exploits the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) inherently present in all materials . so far , this approach could not be applied to electrons in silicon , due to their extremely weak soc . here we report an experimental realization of electrically driven electron - spin resonance in a silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) nanowire quantum dot device . the underlying driving mechanism results from an interplay between soc and the multi - valley structure of the silicon conduction band , which is enhanced in the investigated nanowire geometry . we present a simple model capturing the essential physics and use tight - binding simulations for a more quantitative analysis . we discuss the relevance of our findings to the development of compact and scalable electron - spin qubits in silicon .
