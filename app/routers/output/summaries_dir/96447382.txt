we propose the analog quantum simulation of generalized dicke models in trapped ions . by combining bicromatic laser interactions on multiple ions we can generate all regimes of light - matter coupling in these models , where here the light mode is mimicked by a motional mode . we present numerical simulations of the three - qubit dicke model both in the weak field ( wf ) regime , where the jaynes - cummings behaviour arises , and the ultrastrong coupling ( usc ) regime , where rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) can not be considered . we also simulate the two - qubit biased dicke model in the wf and usc regimes and the two - qubit anisotropic dicke model in the usc regime and the deep - strong coupling ( dsc ) regime . the agreement between the mathematical models and the ion system convinces us that these quantum simulations can be implemented in the lab with current or near - future technology . this formalism establishes an avenue for the quantum simulation of many - spin dicke models in trapped ions .
