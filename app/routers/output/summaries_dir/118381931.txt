non - anticommutative deformations have been studied in the context of supersymmetry ( susy ) in three and four space - time dimensions , and the general picture is that highly nontrivial to deform supersymmetry in a way that still preserves some of its important properties , both at the formal algebraic level ( e.g. , preserving the associativity of the deformed theory ) as well as at the physical level ( e.g. , maintaining renormalizability ) . the hopf algebra formalism allows the definition of algebraically consistent deformations of susy , but this algebraic consistency does not guarantee that physical models build upon these structures will be consistent from the physical point of view . we will investigate a deformation induced by a drinfel'd twist of the $ { \cal n}=1 $ susy algebra in three space - time dimensions . the use of the hopf algebra formalism allows the construction of deformed $ { \cal n}=1 $ susy algebras that should still preserve a deformed version of supersymmetry . we will construct the simplest deformed version of the wess - zumino model in this context , but we will show that despite the consistent algebraic structure , the model in question is not invariant under susy transformation and is not renormalizable . we will comment on the relation of these results with previous ones discussed in the literature regarding similar four - dimensional constructions .
