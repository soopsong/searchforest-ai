due to their strict photon - number correlation , the twin beams produced in parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) work well for heralded state generation . often , however , this state manipulation is distorted by the optical losses in the herald and by the higher photon - number contributions inevitable in the pdc process . in order to find feasible figures of merit for characterizing the heralded states , we investigate their normalized factorial moments of the photon number that can be accessed regardless of the optical losses in the detection . we then perform a measurement of the joint photon statistics of twin beams from a semiconductor bragg - reflection waveguide with transition edge sensors acting as photon - number - resolving detectors . we extract the photon - number parity of heralded single photons in a loss - tolerant fashion by utilizing the moment generating function . the photon - number parity is highly practicable in quantum state characterization , since it takes into account the complete photon - number content of the target state .
