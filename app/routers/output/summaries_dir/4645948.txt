we develop an enhanced technique for characterizing quantum optical processes based on probing unknown quantum processes only with coherent states . our method substantially improves the original proposal [ m. lobino et al . , science 322 , 563 ( 2008 ) ] , which uses a filtered glauber - sudarshan decomposition to determine the effect of the process on an arbitrary state . we introduce a new relation between the action of a general quantum process on coherent state inputs and its action on an arbitrary quantum state . this relation eliminates the need to invoke the glauber - sudarshan representation for states ; hence it dramatically simplifies the task of process identification and removes a potential source of error . the new relation also enables straightforward extensions of the method to multi - mode and non - trace - preserving processes . we illustrate our formalism with several examples , in which we derive analytic representations of several fundamental quantum optical processes in the fock basis . in particular , we introduce photon - number cutoff as a reasonable physical resource limitation and address resource vs accuracy trade - off in practical applications . we show that the accuracy of process estimation scales inversely with the square root of photon - number cutoff .
