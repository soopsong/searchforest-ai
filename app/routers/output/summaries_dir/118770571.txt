this paper presents a new symmetrical interpretation ( si ) of relativistic quantum mechanics which postulates : quantum mechanics is a theory about complete experiments , not particles ; a complete experiment is maximally described by a complex transition amplitude density ; and this transition amplitude density never collapses . this si is compared to the copenhagen interpretation ( ci ) for the analysis of einstein 's bubble experiment . this si makes several experimentally testable predictions that differ from the ci , solves one part of the measurement problem , resolves some inconsistencies of the ci , and gives intuitive explanations of some previously mysterious quantum effects .
