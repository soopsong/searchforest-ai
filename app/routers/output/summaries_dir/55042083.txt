the near - horizon geometry of evaporation black holes is determined according to the semi - classical einstein equation . we consider spherically symmetric configurations in which the collapsing star has already collapsed below the schwarzschild radius . the back - reaction of the vacuum energy - momentum , including hawking radiation , is taken into account . the vacuum energy - momentum plays a crucial role in a small neighborhood of the apparent horizon , as it appears at the leading order in the semi - classical einstein equation . our study is focused on the time - dependent geometry in this region .
