as the hyperentanglement of photon systems presents lots of unique opportunities in high - capacity quantum networking , the hyperentanglement purification protocol ( hyper - epp ) becomes a vital project work and the quality of its accomplishment attracts much attention recently . here we present the first theoretical scheme of faithful hyper - epp for nonlocal two - photon systems in two degrees of freedom ( dofs ) by constructing several fidelity - robust quantum circuits for hyper - encoded photons . with this faithful hyper - epp , the bit - flip errors in both the polarization and spatial - mode dofs can be efficiently corrected and the maximal hyperentanglement in two dofs could be in principle achieved by performing the hyper - epp multiple rounds . moreover , the fidelity - robust quantum circuits , parity - check quantum nondemolition detectors , and swap gates make this hyper - epp works faithfully as the errors coming from practical scattering , in these quantum circuits , are converted into a detectable failure rather than infidelity . furthermore , this hyper - epp can be directly extended to purify photon systems entangled in single polarization or spatial - mode dof and that hyperentangled in polarization and multiple - spatial - mode dofs .
