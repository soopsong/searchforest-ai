in the counterfactual cryptography scheme proposed by noh ( 2009 ) , the sender alice probabilistically transmits classical information to the receiver bob without the physical travel of a particle . here we generalize this idea to the distribution of quantum entanglement . the key insight is to replace their classical input choices with quantum superpositions . we further show that the scheme can be generalized to counterfactually distribute multi - partite cat states .
