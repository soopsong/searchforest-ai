in a scenario where two parties share , act on and exchange some physical resource , the assumption that the parties ' actions are ordered according to a definite causal structure yields constraints on the possible correlations that can be established . we show that the set of correlations that are compatible with a definite causal order forms a polytope , whose facets define causal inequalities . we fully characterize this causal polytope in the simplest case of bipartite correlations with binary inputs and outputs . we find two families of nonequivalent causal inequalities ; both can be violated in the recently introduced framework of process matrices , which extends the standard quantum formalism by relaxing the implicit assumption of a fixed causal structure . our work paves the way to a more systematic investigation of causal inequalities in a theory - independent way , and of their violation within the framework of process matrices .
