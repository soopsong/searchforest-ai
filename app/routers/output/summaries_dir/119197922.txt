open - access microcavities are emerging as a new approach to confine and engineer light at mode volumes down to the $ \lambda^3 $ regime . they offer direct access to a highly confined electromagnetic field while maintaining tunability of the system and flexibility for coupling to a range of matter systems . this article presents a study of coupled cavities , for which the substrates are produced using focused ion beam milling . based on experimental and theoretical investigation the engineering of the coupling between two microcavities with radius of curvature of \si{6}{\micro\meter } is demonstrated . details are provided by studying the evolution of spectral , spatial and polarisation properties through the transition from isolated to coupled cavities . normal mode splittings up to 20 mev are observed for total mode volumes around $ 10 \times \lambda^3$. this work is of importance for future development of lab - on - a - chip sensors and photonic open - access devices ranging from polariton systems to quantum simulators .
