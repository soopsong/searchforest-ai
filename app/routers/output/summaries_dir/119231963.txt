a hybrid quantum system is proposed by coupling the internal hyperfine transitions of a trapped atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) via the macroscopic quantum field of the flux qubit . the presence of the condensate leads to a bosonic enhancement of the rabi frequency over the otherwise small single - particle magnetic dipole transition matrix elements . this enhancement allows for the possibility to rapidly transfer and store qubit states in the bec that were originally prepared in the squid . the fidelity of this transfer for different states is calculated , and a direct experimental protocol to determine the transfer fidelity by quantum tomography of the bec qubit is presented .
