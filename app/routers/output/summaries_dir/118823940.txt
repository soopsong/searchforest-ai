the minimum requirements for entanglement detection are discussed for a spin chain in which the spins can not be individually accessed . the methods presented detect entangled states close to a cluster state and a many - body singlet state , and seem to be viable for experimental realization in optical lattices of two - state bosonic atoms . the entanglement criteria are based on entanglement witnesses and on the uncertainty of collective observables .
