we propose a practical scheme for deterministically teleporting an arbitrary multipartite state , either product or entangled , using faraday rotation of the photonic polarization . our scheme , based on the input - output process of single - photon pulses regarding cavities , works in low - q cavities and only involves virtual excitation of the atoms , which is insensitive to both cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission . besides , the bell - state measurement is accomplished by the faraday rotation plus product - state measurements , which could much relax the experimental difficulty to realize the bell - state measurement by the cnot operation .
