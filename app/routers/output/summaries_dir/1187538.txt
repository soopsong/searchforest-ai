recent progress in nanoscale quantum optics and superconducting qubits has made the creation of strongly correlated , and even topologically ordered , states of photons a real possibility . many of these states are gapped and exhibit anyon excitations , which could be used for a robust form of quantum information processing . however , while numerous qubit array proposals exist to engineer the hamiltonian for these systems , the question of how to stabilize the many - body ground state of these photonic quantum simulators against photon losses remains largely unanswered . we here propose a simple mechanism which achieves this goal for abelian and non - abelian fractional quantum hall states of light . our construction uses a uniform two - photon drive field to couple the qubits of the primary lattice with an auxiliary ` ` shadow"lattice , composed of qubits with a much faster loss rate than the qubits of the primary quantum simulator itself . this coupling causes hole states created by photon losses to be rapidly refilled , and the system 's many - body gap prevents further photons from being added once the strongly correlated ground state is reached . the fractional quantum hall state ( with a small , transient population of quasihole excitations ) is thus the most stable state of the system , and all other configurations will relax toward it over time . the physics described here could be implemented in a circuit qed architecture , and the device parameters needed for our scheme to succeed are in reach of current technology . we also propose a simple 6 qubit device , which could easily be built in the near future , that can act as a proof of principle for our scheme .
