the computable cross norm ( ccn ) criterion is a new powerful analytical and computable separability criterion for bipartite quantum states , that is also known to systematically detect bound entanglement . in certain aspects this criterion complements the well - known peres positive partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion . in the present paper we study important analytical properties of the ccn criterion . we show that in contrast to the ppt criterion it is not sufficient in dimension 2 x 2 . in higher dimensions we prove theorems connecting the fidelity of a quantum state with the ccn criterion . we also analyze the behaviour of the ccn criterion under local operations and identify the operations that leave it invariant . it turns out that the ccn criterion is in general not invariant under local operations .
