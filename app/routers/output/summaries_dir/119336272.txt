in this article we develop , step by step , the framework for universal dynamical control of two - level systems ( tls ) or qubits experiencing amplitude- or phase - noise ( an or pn ) due to coupling to a thermal bath . a comprehensive arsenal of modulation schemes is introduced and applied to either an or pn , resulting in completely analogous formulae for the decoherence rates , thus underscoring the unified nature of this universal formalism . we then address the extension of this formalism to multipartite decoherence control , where symmetries are exploited to overcome decoherence .
