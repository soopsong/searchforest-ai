the fundamental physical mechanisms of energy transfer in photosynthetic complexes is not yet fully understood . in particular , the degree of efficiency or sensitivity of these systems for energy transfer is not known given their non - perturbative and non - markovian interactions with proteins backbone and surrounding photonic and phononic environments . one major problem in studying light - harvesting complexes has been the lack of an efficient method for simulation of their dynamics in biological environments . to this end , here we revisit the second - order time - convolution ( tc2 ) master equation and examine its reliability beyond extreme markovian and perturbative limits . in particular , we present a derivation of tc2 without making the usual weak system - bath coupling assumption . using this equation , we explore the long time behaviour of exciton dynamics of fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) protein complex . moreover , we introduce a constructive error analysis to estimate the accuracy of tc2 equation in calculating energy transfer efficiency , exhibiting reliable performance for environments with weak and intermediate memory and strength . furthermore , we numerically show that energy transfer efficiency is optimal and robust for the fmo protein complex of green sulphur bacteria with respect to variations in reorganization energy and bath correlation time - scales .
