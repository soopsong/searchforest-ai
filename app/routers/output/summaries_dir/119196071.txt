we report an efficient mechanism to generate a squeezed state of a mechanical mirror in an optomechanical system . we use especially tuned parametric amplifier ( pa ) inside the cavity and the parametric photon phonon processes to transfer quantum squeezing from photons to phonons with almost 100\% efficiency . we get 50\% squeezing of the mechanical mirror which is limited by the pa . we present analytical results for the mechanical squeezing thus enabling one to understand the dependence of squeezing on system parameters like gain of pa , cooperativity , temperature . as in cooling experiments the detrimental effects of mirror 's brownian and zero point noises are strongly suppressed by the pumping power . by judicious choice of the phases , the cavity output is squeezed only if the mirror is squeezed thus providing us a direct measure of the mirror 's squeezing . further considerable larger squeezing of the mirror can be obtained by adding the known feedback techniques .
