exceptional points , resulting from non - hermitian degeneracies , have the potential to enhance the capabilities of quantum sensing . thus , finding exceptional points in different quantum systems is vital for developing such future sensing devices . taking advantage of the enhanced light - matter interactions in a confined volume on a metal nanoparticle surface , here we theoretically demonstrate the existence of exceptional points in a system consisting of quantum emitters coupled to a metal nanoparticle of subwavelength scale . by using an analytical quantum electrodynamics approach , exceptional points are manifested as a result of a strong coupling effect and observable in a drastic splitting of originally coalescent eigenenergies . furthermore , we show that exceptional points can also occur when a number of quantum emitters is collectively coupled to the dipole mode of localized surface plasmons . such a quantum collective effect not only relaxes the strong - coupling requirement for an individual emitter , but also results in a more stable generation of the exceptional points . finally , we point out that the exceptional points can be explicitly shown in the transmission spectrum of an ancilla waveguide coupled to the system .
