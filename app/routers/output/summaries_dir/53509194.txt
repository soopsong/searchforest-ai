in this paper we numerically calculate the out - of - time - order correlation functions in the one - dimensional bose - hubbard model . our study is motivated by the conjecture that a system with lyapunov exponent saturating the upper bound $ 2\pi/\beta$ will have a holographic dual to a black hole at finite temperature . we further conjecture that for a many - body quantum system with a quantum phase transition , the lyapunov exponent will have a peak in the quantum critical region where there exists an emergent conformal symmetry and is absent of well - defined quasi - particles . with the help of a relation between the r\'enyi entropy and the out - of - time - order correlation function , we argue that the out - of - time - order correlation function of the bose - hubbard model will also exhibit an exponential behavior at the scrambling time . by fitting the numerical results with an exponential function , we extract the lyapunov exponents in the one - dimensional bose - hubbard model across the quantum critical regime at finite temperature . our results on the bose - hubbard model support the conjecture . we also compute the butterfly velocity and propose how the echo type measurement of this correlator in the cold atom realizations of the bose - hubbard model without inverting the hamiltonian .
