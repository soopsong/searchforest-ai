the formation of bound states involving multiple particles underlies many interesting quantum physical phenomena , such as efimov physics or superconductivity . in this work we show the existence of an infinite number of such states for some boson impurity models . they describe free bosons coupled to an impurity and include some of the most representative models in quantum optics . we also propose a family of wavefunctions to describe the bound states and verify that it accurately characterizes all parameter regimes by comparing its predictions with exact numerical calculations for a one - dimensional tight - binding hamiltonian . for that model , we also analyze the nature of the bound states by studying the scaling relations of physical quantities such as the ground state energy and localization length , and find a non - analytical behavior as a function of the coupling strength . finally , we discuss how to test our theoretical predictions in experimental platforms such as photonic crystal structures and cold atoms in optical lattices .
