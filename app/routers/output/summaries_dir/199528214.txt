it has been suggested by giddings that the origin of hawking radiation in black holes is a quantum atmosphere of near - horizon quantum region by investigating both the total emission rate and the stress tensor of hawking radiation . revisiting this issue in the exactly soluble model of a dimensionally reduced schwarzschild black hole , we shall confirm that the dominant hawking radiation in the unruh vacuum indeed occurs at the quantum atmosphere , not just at the horizon by exactly calculating the out - temperature responsible for outgoing hawking particle excitations . consequently we show that the out - temperature vanishes at the horizon and has a peak at a scale whose radial extent is set by the horizon radius , and then decreases to the hawking temperature at infinity . we also discuss bounds of location of the peak for the out - temperature in our model .
