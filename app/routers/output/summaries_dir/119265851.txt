we study the entanglement preservation of two qubits locally interacting with their reservoirs . we show that the existence of a bound state of the qubit and its reservoir and the non - markovian effect are two essential ingredients and their interplay plays a crucial role in preserving the entanglement in the steady state . when the non - markovian effect is neglected , the entanglement sudden death ( esd ) is reproduced . on the other hand , when the non - markovian is significantly strong but the bound state is absent , the phenomenon of the esd and its revival is recovered . our formulation presents a unified picture about the entanglement preservation and provides a clear clue on how to preserve the entanglement in quantum information processing .
