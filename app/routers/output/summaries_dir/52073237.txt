we define a multilayer optimization method for the quantum internet . multilayer optimization integrates separate procedures for the optimization of the quantum layer and the classical layer of the quantum internet . the multilayer optimization procedure defines advanced techniques for the optimization of the layers . the optimization of the quantum layer covers the minimization of total usage time of quantum memories in the quantum nodes , the maximization of the entanglement throughput over the entangled links , and the reduction of the number of entangled links between the arbitrary source and target quantum nodes . the objective of the optimization of the classical layer is the cost minimization of any auxiliary classical communications . the multilayer optimization framework provides a practically implementable tool for quantum network communications , or long - distance quantum communications .
