we study the quantum synchronization between a pair of two - level systems inside two coupled cavities . by using a digital - analog decomposition of the master equation that rules the system dynamics , we show that this approach leads to quantum synchronization between both two - level systems . moreover , we can identify in this digital - analog block decomposition the fundamental elements of a quantum machine learning protocol , in which the agent and the environment ( learning units ) interact through a mediating system , namely , the register . if we can additionally equip this algorithm with a classical feedback mechanism , which consists of projective measurements in the register , reinitialization of the register state and local conditional operations on the agent and environment subspace , a powerful and flexible quantum machine learning protocol emerges . indeed , numerical simulations show that this protocol enhances the synchronization process , even when every subsystem experience different loss / decoherence mechanisms , and give us the flexibility to choose the synchronization state . finally , we propose an implementation based on current technologies in superconducting circuits .
