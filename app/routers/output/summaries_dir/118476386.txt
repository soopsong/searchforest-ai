according to the second law of thermodynamics the total entropy of a system is increased during almost any dynamical process . the positivity of the specific heat implies that the entropy increase is associated with heating . this is generally true both at the single particle level , like in the fermi acceleration mechanism of charged particles reflected by magnetic mirrors , and for complex systems in everyday devices . notable exceptions are known in noninteracting systems of particles moving in periodic potentials . here the phenomenon of dynamical localization can prevent heating beyond certain threshold . the dynamical localization is known to occur both at classical ( fermi - ulam model ) and at quantum levels ( kicked rotor ) . however , it was believed that driven ergodic systems will always heat without bound . here , on the contrary , we report strong evidence of dynamical localization transition in periodically driven ergodic systems in the thermodynamic limit . this phenomenon is reminiscent of many - body localization in energy space .
