a family of quantum measures like the shannon distinguishability is presented . these measures are defined over the two classes of povm measurements and related to separate parts in the expression for mutual information . changes of ky fan 's norms and the partitioned trace distances under the operation of partial trace are discussed . upper and lower bounds on the introduced quantities are obtained in terms of partitioned trace distances and uhlmann 's partial fidelities . these inequalities provide a kind of generalization of the well - known bounds on the shannon distinguishability . the notion of cryptographic exponential indistinguishability for quantum states is revisited . when exponentially fast convergence is required , all the metrics induced by unitarily invariant norms are shown to be equivalent .
