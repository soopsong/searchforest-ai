we investigate the reflectivity and optical scattering characteristics at 1064\,nm of an antireflection coated fused silica window of the type being used in the advanced ligo gravitational - wave detectors . reflectivity is measured in the ultra - low range of 5 - 10\,ppm ( by vendor ) and 14 - 30\,ppm ( by us ) . using an angle - resolved scatterometer we measure the sample 's bidirectional scattering distribution function ( bsdf ) and use this to estimate its transmitted and reflected scatter at roughly 20 - 40\,ppm and 1\,ppm , respectively , over the range of angles measured . we further inspect the sample 's low backscatter using an imaging scatterometer , measuring an angle resolved bsdf below $ 10^{-6}$ sr$^{-1}$ for large angles ( 10$^\circ$--80$^\circ$ from incidence in the plane of the beam ) . we use the associated images to ( partially ) isolate scatter from different regions of the sample and find that scattering from the bulk fused silica is on par with backscatter from the antireflection coated optical surfaces . to confirm that the bulk scattering is caused by rayleigh scattering , we perform a separate experiment , measuring the scattering intensity versus input polarization angle . we estimate that 0.9 - -1.3\,ppm of the backscatter can be accounted for by rayleigh scattering of the bulk fused silica . these results indicate that modern antireflection coatings have low enough scatter to not limit the total backscattering of thick fused silica optics .
