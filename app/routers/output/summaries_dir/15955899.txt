we study the implications of a noncommutative geometry of the minisuperspace variables for the frw universe with a conformally coupled scalar field . the investigation is carried out by means of a comparative study of the universe evolution in four different scenarios : classical commutative , classical noncommutative , quantum commutative , and quantum noncommutative , the last two employing the bohmian formalism of quantum trajectories . the role of noncommutativity is discussed by drawing a parallel between its realizations in two possible frameworks for physical interpretation : the nc - frame , where it is manifest in the universe degrees of freedom , and in the c - frame , where it is manifest through theta - dependent terms in the hamiltonian . as a result of our comparative analysis , we find that noncommutative geometry can remove singularities in the classical context for sufficiently large values of theta . moreover , under special conditions , the classical noncommutative model can admit bouncing solutions characteristic of the commutative quantum frw universe . in the quantum context , we find non - singular universe solutions containing bounces or being periodic in the quantum commutative model . when noncommutativity effects are turned on in the quantum scenario , they can introduce significant modifications that change the singular behavior of the universe solutions or that render them dynamical whenever they are static in the commutative case . the effects of noncommutativity are completely specified only when one of the frames for its realization is adopted as the physical one . non - singular solutions in the nc - frame can be mapped into singular ones in the c - frame .
