we formulate the frobenius - norm - based measures for quantum coherence and asymmetry respectively . in contrast to the resource theory of coherence and asymmetry , we construct a natural measure of quantum coherence inspired from optical coherence theory while the group theoretical approach is employed to quantify the asymmetry of quantum states . besides their simple structures and explicit physical meanings , we observe that these quantities are intimately related to the purity ( or linear entropy ) of the corresponding quantum states . remarkably , we demonstrate that the proposed coherence quantifier is not only a measure of mixedness , but also an intrinsic ( basis - independent ) quantification of quantum coherence contained in quantum states , which can also be viewed as a normalized version of brukner - zeilinger invariant information . in our context , the asymmetry of n - qubit quantum systems is considered under local independent and collective su(2 ) transformations . intriguingly , it is illustrated that the collective effect has a significant impact on the asymmetry measure , and quantum correlation between subsystems plays a non - negligible role in this circumstance .
