we study the entanglement spectrum ( es ) of a finite xxz spin 1/2 chain in the limit \delta ->-1^+ for both open and periodic boundary conditions . at \delta=-1 ( ferromagnetic point ) the model is equivalent to the heisenberg ferromagnet and its degenerate ground state manifold is the su(2 ) multiplet with maximal total spin . any state in this so - called"symmetric sector"is an equal weight superposition of all possible spin configurations . in the gapless phase at \delta>-1 this property is progressively lost as one moves away from the \delta=-1 point . we investigate how the es obtained from the states in this manifold reflects this change , using exact diagonalization and bethe ansatz calculations . we find that in the limit \delta ->-1^+ most of the es levels show divergent behavior . moreover , while at \delta=-1 the es contains no information about the boundaries , for \delta>-1 it depends dramatically on the choice of boundary conditions . for both open and periodic boundary conditions the es exhibits an elegant multiplicity structure for which we conjecture a combinatorial formula . we also study the entanglement eigenfunctions , i.e. the eigenfunctions of the reduced density matrix . we find that the eigenfunctions corresponding to the non diverging levels mimic the behavior of the state wavefunction , whereas the others show intriguing polynomial structures . finally we analyze the distribution of the es levels as the system is detuned away from \delta=-1 .
