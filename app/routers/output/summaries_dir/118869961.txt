we analyze the quantum information processing capability of a superconducting transmon circuit used to mediate interactions between quantum information stored in a collection of phononic crystal cavity resonators . having only a single processing element to be controlled externally makes this approach significantly less hardware - intensive than traditional architectures with individual control of each qubit . moreover , when compared with the commonly considered alternative approach using coplanar waveguide or 3d cavity microwave resonators for storage , the nanomechanical resonators offer both very long lifetime and small size -- two conflicting requirements for microwave resonators . a detailed gate error analysis leads to an optimal value for the qubit - resonator coupling rate as a function of the number of mechanical resonators in the system . for a given set of system parameters , a specific amount of coupling and number of resonators is found to optimize the quantum volume , an approximate measure for the computational capacity of a system . we see this volume is higher in the proposed hybrid nanomechanical architecture than in the competing on - chip electromagnetic approach .
