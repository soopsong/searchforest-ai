systems of coupled photonic cavities have been predicted to exhibit quantum phase transitions by analogy with the hubbard model . to this end , we have studied topologies of few ( up to six ) photonic cavities each containing a single two - level system . quantum phase space diagrams are produced for these systems , and compared to mean - field results . we also consider finite effective temperature , and compare this to the notion of disorder . we find the extent of the mott lobes shrink analogously to the conventional bose - hubbard model .
