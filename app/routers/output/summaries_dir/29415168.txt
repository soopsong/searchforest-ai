we propose an entanglement purification protocol for high - dimensional multipartite systems . in the protocol we can select a subensemble in a pure generalized greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state . this post - selection can be made by detecting the noise which contaminated the initial pure ensemble when the systems past through a noisy environment . for the detection of noise we investigate correlation properties of ghz states and analyze their possible errors due to a noisy environment . we show that the presented protocol is more efficient than a simple generalization of the purification protocol for a bipartite state in high dimensions .
