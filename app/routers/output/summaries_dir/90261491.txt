superconducting transmon qubits are of great interest for quantum computing and quantum simulation . a key component of quantum chemistry simulation algorithms is breaking up the evolution into small steps , which naturally leads to the need for non - maximally entangling , arbitrary cphase gates . here we design such microwave - based gates using an analytically solvable approach leading to smooth , simple pulses . we use the local invariants of the evolution operator in $ su(4)$ to develop a method of constructing pulse protocols , which allows for the continuous tuning of the phase . we find cphase fidelities of more than $ 0.999 $ and gate times as low as $ 100\text { ns}$.
