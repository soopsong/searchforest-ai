the simulation dynamics of light - harvesting complexes as open quantum systems in the weak and strong coupling regimes has been recently attended . in this paper , we investigate digital approach to quantum dynamics simulation of photosynthetic fenna - matthew - olson ( fmo ) complex in contact with a markovian bath , i.e. , memoryless , with the nuclear spin - based quantum simulator . for this purpose , we use recoupling and decoupling method on nuclear magnetic resonance(nmr ) quantum computation and solovay - kitaev decomposition strategy for single - qubit channels . finally we use near - term quantum computer that developed by rigetti to implement circuits . the results shows an efficient quantum simulation of photosynthesis system .
