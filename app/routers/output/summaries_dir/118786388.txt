the evolution speed in projective hilbert space is considered for hermitian hamiltonians and for non - hermitian ( nh ) ones . based on the hilbert - schmidt norm and the spectral norm of a hamiltonian , resource - related upper bounds on the evolution speed are constructed . these bounds are valid also for nh hamiltonians and they are illustrated for an optical nh hamiltonian and for a non - hermitian $ \mathcal{pt}-$symmetric matrix hamiltonian . furthermore , the concept of quantum speed efficiency is introduced as measure of the system resources directly spent on the motion in the projective hilbert space . a recipe for the construction of time - dependent hamiltonians which ensure 100 % speed efficiency is given . generally these efficient hamiltonians are nh but there is a hermitian efficient hamiltonian as well . finally , the extremal case of a non - hermitian non - diagonalizable hamiltonian with vanishing energy difference is shown to produce a 100 % efficient evolution with minimal resources consumption .
