quantum computing promises exponential speed - ups for important simulation and optimization problems . it also poses new cad problems that are similar to , but more challenging , than the related problems in classical ( non - quantum ) cad , such as determining if two states or circuits are functionally equivalent . while differences in classical states are easy to detect , quantum states , which are represented by complex - valued vectors , exhibit subtle differences leading to several notions of equivalence . this provides flexibility in optimizing quantum circuits , but leads to difficult new equivalence - checking issues for simulation and synthesis . we identify several different equivalence - checking problems and present algorithms for practical benchmarks , including quantum communication and search circuits , which are shown to be very fast and robust for hundreds of qubits .
