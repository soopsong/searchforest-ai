while conventional optical trapping techniques can trap objects with submicron dimensions , the underlying limits imposed by the diffraction of light generally restrict their use to larger or higher refractive index particles . as the index and diameter decrease , the trapping difficulty rapidly increases ; hence , the power requirements for stable trapping become so large as to quickly denature the trapped objects in such diffraction - limited systems . here , we present an evanescent field based device capable of confining low index nanoscale particles using modest optical powers as low as 1.2 mw , with additional applications in the field of cold atom trapping . our experiment uses a nanostructured optical micro - nanofiber to trap 200 nm , low index contrast , fluorescent particles within the structured region , thereby overcoming diffraction limitations . we analyze the trapping potential of this device both experimentally and theoretically , and show how strong optical traps are achieved with low input powers .
