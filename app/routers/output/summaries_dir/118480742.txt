we present an architecture for the quantum simulation of many - body spin interactions based on ultracold polar molecules trapped in optical lattices . our approach employs digital quantum simulation , i.e. , the dynamics of the simulated system is reproduced by the quantum simulator in a stroboscopic pattern , and allows to simulate both coherent and dissipative dynamics . we discuss the realization of kitaev 's toric code hamiltonian , a paradigmatic model involving four - body interactions , and we analyze the requirements for an experimental implementation .
