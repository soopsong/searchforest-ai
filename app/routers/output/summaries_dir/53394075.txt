we analyze the spectral properties of squeezed light produced by means of pulsed , single - pass degenerate parametric down - conversion . the multimode output of this process can be decomposed into characteristic modes undergoing independent squeezing evolution akin to the schmidt decomposition of the biphoton spectrum . the main features of this decomposition can be understood using a simple analytical model developed in the perturbative regime . in the strong pumping regime , for which the perturbative approach is not valid , we present a numerical analysis , specializing to the case of one - dimensional propagation in a beta - barium borate waveguide . characterization of the squeezing modes provides us with an insight necessary for optimizing homodyne detection of squeezing . for a weak parametric process , efficient squeezing is found in a broad range of local oscillator modes , whereas the intense generation regime places much more stringent conditions on the local oscillator . we point out that without meeting these conditions , the detected squeezing can actually diminish with the increasing pumping strength , and we expose physical reasons behind this inefficiency .
