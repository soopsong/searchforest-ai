the purpose of this paper is to study the mixed linear quadratic gaussian ( lqg ) and $ h_\infty$ optimal control problem for linear quantum stochastic systems , where the controller itself is also a quantum system , often referred to as"coherent feedback controller " . a lower bound of the lqg control is proved . then two different methods , rank constrained linear matrix inequality ( lmi ) method and genetic algorithm are proposed for controller design . a passive system ( cavity ) and a non - passive one ( degenerate parametric amplifier , dpa ) demonstrate the effectiveness of these two proposed algorithms .
