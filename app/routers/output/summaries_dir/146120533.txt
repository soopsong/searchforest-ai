in this paper , we present a hamiltonian identification method for a closed quantum system whose time trace observables are measured with colored measurement noise . the dynamics of the quantum system are described by a liouville equation which can be converted to a coherence vector representation . since the measurement process is disturbed by classical colored noise , we introduce an augmented system model to describe the total dynamics , where the classical colored noise is parameterized . based on the augmented system model as well as the measurement data , we can find a realization of the quantum system with unknown parameters by employing an eigenstate realization algorithm . the unknown parameters can be identified using a transfer - function - based technique . an example of a two - qubit system with colored measurement noise is demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of our method .
