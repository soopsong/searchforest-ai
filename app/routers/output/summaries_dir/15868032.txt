non - markovianity has recently attracted large interest due to significant advances in its characterization and its exploitation for quantum information processing . however , up to now , only non - markovian regimes featuring environment to system backflow of information ( strong non - markovianity ) have been experimentally simulated . in this work , using an all - optical setup we simulate and observe the so - called weak non - markovian dynamics . through full process tomography , we experimentally demonstrate that the dynamics of a qubit can be non - markovian despite an always increasing correlation between the system and its environment which , in our case , denotes no information backflow . we also show the transition from the weak to the strong regime by changing a single parameter in the environmental state , leading us to a better understanding of the fundamental features of non - markovianity .
