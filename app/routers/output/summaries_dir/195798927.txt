we study the problem of distributed consensus in networks where the local agents have high - order ( $ n\ge 3 $ ) integrator dynamics , and where all feedback is localized in that each agent has a bounded number of neighbors . we prove that no consensus algorithm based on relative differences between states of neighboring agents can then achieve consensus in networks of any size . that is , while a given algorithm may allow a small network to converge to consensus , the same algorithm will lead to instability if agents are added to the network so that it grows beyond a certain finite size . this holds in classes of network graphs whose algebraic connectivity , that is , the smallest non - zero laplacian eigenvalue , is decreasing towards zero in network size . this applies , for example , to all planar graphs . our proof , which relies on routh - hurwitz criteria for complex - valued polynomials , holds true for directed graphs with normal graph laplacians . we survey classes of graphs where this issue arises , and also discuss leader - follower consensus , where instability will arise in any growing , undirected network as long as the feedback is localized .
