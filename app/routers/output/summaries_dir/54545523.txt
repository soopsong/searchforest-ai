we study the impact of two - photon absorption ( 2pa ) and fifth - order nonlinear loss such as 2pa - induced free - carrier absorption in semiconductors on the performance of stimulated brillouin scattering devices . we formulate the equations of motion including effective loss coefficients , whose explicit expressions are provided for numerical evaluation in any waveguide geometry . we find that 2pa results in a monotonic , algebraic relationship between amplification , waveguide length and pump power , whereas fifth - order losses lead to a non - monotonic relationship . we define a figure of merit for materials and waveguide designs in the presence of fifth - order losses . from this , we determine the optimal waveguide length for the case of 2pa alone and upper bounds for the total stokes amplification for the case of 2pa as well as fifth - order losses . the analysis is performed analytically using a small - signal approximation and is compared to numerical solutions of the full nonlinear modal equations .
