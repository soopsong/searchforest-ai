grover 's algorithm is one of the most famous algorithms which explicitly demonstrates how the quantum nature can be utilized to accelerate the searching process . in this work , grover 's quantum search problem is mapped to a time - optimal control problem . resorting to pontryagin 's minimum principle we find that the time - optimal solution has the bang - singular - bang structure . this structure can be derived naturally , without integrating the differential equations , using the geometric control technique where hamiltonians in the schr\"odinger 's equation are represented as vector fields . in view of optimal control , grover 's algorithm uses the bang - bang protocol to approximate the optimal protocol with a minimized number of bang - to - bang switchings to reduce the query complexity . our work provides a concrete example how pontryagin 's minimum principle is connected to quantum computation , and offers insight into how a quantum algorithm can be designed .
