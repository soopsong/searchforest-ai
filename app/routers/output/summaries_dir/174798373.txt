though algorithms for quantum simulation of quantum harmonic oscillator ( qho ) have been proposed , still they have not yet been experimentally verified . here , for the first time , we demonstrate a quantum simulation of qho in the presence of both time - varying and constant force field for both one and two dimensional case . new quantum circuits are developed to simulate both the one and two - dimensional qho and are implemented on the real quantum chip"ibmqx4 " . experimental data , clearly illustrating the dynamics of qho in the presence of time - dependent force field , are presented in graphs for different frequency parameters in the hamiltonian picture .
