we introduce the notion of perturbations of quantum stochastic models using the series product , and establish the asymptotic convergence of sequences of quantum stochastic models under the assumption that they are related via a right series product perturbation . while the perturbing models converge to the trivial model , we allow that the individual sequences may be divergent corresponding to large model parameter regimes that frequently occur in physical applications . this allows us to introduce the concept of asymptotically equivalent models , and we provide several examples where we replace one sequence of models with an equivalent one tailored to capture specific features . these examples include : a series product formulation of the principle of virtual work ; essential commutativity of the noise in strong squeezing models ; the decoupling of polarization channels in scattering by faraday rotation driven by a strong laser field ; and an application to quantum local asymptotic normality .
