we show that the dynamical casimir effect in an optomechanical system can be achieved under incoherent mechanical pumping . we adopt a fully quantum - mechanical approach for both the cavity field and the oscillating mirror . the dynamics is then evaluated using a recently - developed master equation approach in the dressed picture , including both zero and finite temperature photonic reservoirs . this analysis shows that the dynamical casimir effect can be observed even when the mean value of the mechanical displacement is zero . this opens up new possibilities for the experimental observation of this effect . we also calculate cavity emission spectra both in the resonant and the dispersive regimes , providing useful information on the emission process .
