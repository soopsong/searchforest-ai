we investigate the influence of electrical charge noise on a resonant exchange ( rx ) qubit in a triple quantum dot . this rx qubit is a variation of the exchange - only spin qubit which responds to a narrow - band resonant frequency . our noise model includes uncorrelated charge noise in each quantum dot giving rise to two independent ( noisy ) bias parameters $ \varepsilon$ and $ \delta$. we calculate the energy splitting of the two qubit states as a function of these two bias detuning parameters to find"sweet spots " , where the qubit is least susceptible to noise . our investigation shows that such sweet spots exist within the low bias regime , in which the bias detuning parameters have the same magnitude as the hopping parameters . the location of the sweet spots in the $ ( \varepsilon,\delta)$ plane depends on the hopping strength and asymmetry between the quantum dots . in the regime of weak charge noise , we identify a new favorable operating regime for the rx qubit based on these sweet spots .
