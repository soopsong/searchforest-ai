we discuss quantum capacities for two types of entanglement networks : $ \mathcal{q}$ for the quantum repeater network with free classical communication , and $ \mathcal{r}$ for the tensor network as the rank of the linear operation represented by the tensor network . we find that $ \mathcal{q}$ always equals $ \mathcal{r}$ in the regularized case for the samenetwork graph . however , the relationships between the corresponding one - shot capacities $ \mathcal{q}_1 $ and $ \mathcal{r}_1 $ are more complicated , and the min - cut upper bound is in general not achievable . we show that the tensor network can be viewed as a stochastic protocol with the quantum repeater network , such that $ \mathcal{r}_1 $ is a natural upper bound of $ \mathcal{q}_1$. we analyze the possible gap between $ \mathcal{r}_1 $ and $ \mathcal{q}_1 $ for certain networks , and compare them with the one - shot classical capacity of the corresponding classical network .
