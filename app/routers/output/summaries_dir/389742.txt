reversible computation is gaining increasing relevance in the context of several post - cmos technologies , the most prominent of those being quantum computing . one of the key theoretical problem pertaining to reversible logic synthesis is the upper bound of the gate count . compared to the known bounds , the results obtained by optimal synthesis methods are significantly less . in this paper , we connect this problem with the multiplicative complexity analysis of classical boolean functions . we explore the possibility of relaxing the ancilla and if that approach makes the upper bound tighter . our results are negative . the ancilla - free synthesis methods by using transformations and by starting from an exclusive sum - of - product ( esop ) formulation remain , theoretically , the synthesis methods for achieving least gate count for the cases where the number of variables $ n$ is $ < 8 $ and otherwise , respectively .
