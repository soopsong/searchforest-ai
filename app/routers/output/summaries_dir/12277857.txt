we present quantum circuits to implement an exhaustive key search for the advanced encryption standard ( aes ) and analyze the quantum resources required to carry out such an attack . we consider the overall circuit size , the number of qubits , and the circuit depth as measures for the cost of the presented quantum algorithms . throughout , we focus on clifford$+t$ gates as the underlying fault - tolerant logical quantum gate set . in particular , for all three variants of aes ( key size 128 , 192 , and 256 bit ) that are standardized in fips - pub 197 , we establish precise bounds for the number of qubits and the number of elementary logical quantum gates that are needed to implement grover 's quantum algorithm to extract the key from a small number of aes plaintext - ciphertext pairs .
