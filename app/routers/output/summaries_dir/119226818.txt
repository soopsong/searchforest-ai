boson - sampling has emerged as a promising avenue towards post - classical optical quantum computation , and numerous elementary demonstrations have recently been performed . spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) is the mainstay for single - photon state preparation , the technique employed in most optical quantum information processing implementations to - date . here we present a simple architecture for boson - sampling based on multiplexed spdc sources and demonstrate that the architecture is limited only by the post - selection detection efficiency assuming that other errors , such as spectral impurity , dark counts , and interferometric instability are negligible . for any given number of input photons , there exists a minimum detector efficiency that allows post selection . if this efficiency is achieved , photon - number errors in the spdc sources are sufficiently low as to guarantee correct boson - sampling most of the time . in this scheme the required detector efficiency must increase exponentially in the photon number . thus , we show that idealised spdc sources will not present a bottleneck for future boson - sampling implementations . rather , photodetection efficiency is the limiting factor and thus future implementations may continue to employ spdc sources .
