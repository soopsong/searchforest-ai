superconducting transmon qubits comprise one of the most promising platforms for quantum information processing due to their long coherence times and to their scalability into larger qubit networks . however , their weakly anharmonic spectrum leads to spectral crowding in multiqubit systems , making it challenging to implement fast , high - fidelity gates while avoiding leakage errors . to address this challenge , we use a protocol known as swipht [ phys . rev . b 91 , 161405(r ) ( 2015 ) ] , which yields smooth , simple microwave pulses designed to suppress leakage without sacrificing gate speed through spectral selectivity . here , we determine the parameter regimes in which swipht is effective and demonstrate that in these regimes it systematically produces two - qubit gate fidelities for cavity - coupled transmons in the range 99.6%-99.9 % with gate times as fast as 23 ns . our results are obtained from full numerical simulations that include current experimental levels of relaxation and dephasing . these high fidelities persist over a wide range of system parameters that encompass many current experimental setups and are insensitive to small parameter variations and pulse imperfections .
