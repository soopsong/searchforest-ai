let l(m , n ) denote the convex set of completely positive trace preserving operators from c^{m x m } to c^{n x n}$ , i.e quantum channels . we give a necessary condition for l in l(m , n ) to be an extreme point . we show that generically , this condition is also sufficient . we characterize completely the extreme points of l_(2,2 ) and l(3,2 ) , i.e. quantum channels from qubits to qubits and from qutrits to qubits .
