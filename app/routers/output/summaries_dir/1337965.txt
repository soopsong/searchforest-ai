we provide a new algorithm that translates a unitary matrix into a quantum circuit according to the g = kak theorem in lie group theory . with our algorithm , any matrix decomposition corresponding to type - aiii kak decompositions can be derived according to the given cartan involution . our algorithm contains , as its special cases , cosine - sine decomposition ( csd ) and khaneja - glaser decomposition ( kgd ) in the sense that it derives the same quantum circuits as the ones obtained by them if we select suitable cartan involutions and square root matrices . the selections of cartan involutions for computing csd and kgd will be hown explicitly . as an example , we show explicitly that our method can automatically reproduce the well - known efficient quantum circuit for the n - qubit quantum fourier transform .
