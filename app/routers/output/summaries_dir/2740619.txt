a quantum computer can efficiently find the order of an element in a group , factors of composite integers , discrete logarithms , stabilisers in abelian groups , and hidden or unknown subgroups of abelian groups . it is already known how to phrase the first four problems as the estimation of eigenvalues of certain unitary operators . here we show how the solution to the more general abelian hidden subgroup problem can also be described and analysed as such . we then point out how certain instances of these problems can be solved with only one control qubit , or flying qubits , instead of entire registers of control qubits .
