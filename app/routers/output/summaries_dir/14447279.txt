noisy computation and reversible computation have been studied separately , and it is known that they are as powerful as unrestricted computation . we study the case where both noise and reversibility are combined and show that the combined model is weaker than unrestricted computation . in our noisy reversible circuits , each wire is flipped with probability p each time step , and all the inputs to the circuit are present in time 0 . we prove that any noisy reversible circuit must have size exponential in its depth in order to compute a function with high probability . this is tight as we show that any circuit can be converted into a noise - resistant reversible one with a blow up in size which is exponential in the depth . this establishes that noisy reversible computation has the power of the complexity class nc^1 . we extend this to quantum circuits(qc ) . we prove that any noisy qc which is not worthless , and for which all inputs are present at time 0 , must have size exponential in its depth . ( this high - lights the fact that fault tolerant qc must use a constant supply of inputs all the time . ) for the lower bound , we show that quasi - polynomial noisy qc are at least powerful as logarithmic depth qc , ( or qnc^1 ) . making these bounds tight is left open in the quantum case .
