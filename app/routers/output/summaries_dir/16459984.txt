the cluster state , the highly entangled state that is the central resource for one - way quantum computing , can be efficiently generated in a variety of physical implementations via global nearest - neighbor interactions . in practice , a systematic phase error is expected in the entangling process , resulting in imperfect cluster states . we present a stochastic measurement technique to generate large perfect cluster states and other graph states with high probability from imperfect cluster states even when their initial entanglement is weak .
