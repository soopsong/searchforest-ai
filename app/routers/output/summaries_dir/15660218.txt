we present an experimental and theoretical study of the energy transfer between modes during the tapering process of an optical nanofiber through spectrogram analysis . the results allow optimization of the tapering process , and we measure transmission in excess of 99.95 % for the fundamental mode . we quantify the adiabaticity condition through calculations and place an upper bound on the amount of energy transferred to other modes at each step of the tapering , giving practical limits to the tapering angle .
