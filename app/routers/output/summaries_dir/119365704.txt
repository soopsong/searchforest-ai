continuous - variable systems in quantum theory can be fully described through any one of the $ { \rm s}$-ordered family of quasiprobabilities $ \lambda_{\rm s}(\alpha)$ , $ { \rm s } \in [ -1,1]$. we ask for what values of $ ( { \rm s } , a)$ is the scaling map $ \lambda_{\rm s}(\alpha ) \rightarrow a^{-2 } \lambda_{\rm s}(a^{-1}\alpha)$ a positive map ? our analysis based on a duality we establish settles this issue ( i ) the scaling map generically fails to be positive , showing that there is no useful entanglement witness of the scaling type beyond the transpose map , and ( ii ) in the two particular cases $ ( { \rm s}=1 , |a| \leq 1)$ and $ ( { \rm s}=-1 , |a| \geq 1)$ , and only in these two non - trivial cases , the map is not only positive but also completely positive as seen through the noiseless attenuator and amplifier channels . we also present a ` phase diagram ' for the behaviour of the scaling maps in the $ { \rm s}-a$ parameter space with regard to its positivity , obtained from the viewpoint of symmetric - ordered characteristic functions . this also sheds light on similar diagrams for the practically relevant attenuation and amplification maps with respect to the noise parameter , especially in the range below the complete - positivity ( or quantum - limited ) threshold .
