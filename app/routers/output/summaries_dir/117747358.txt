the purpose of this paper is to study the equivalence relation on unitary bases defined by r. f. werner [ { \it j. phys . a : math . gen . } { \bf 34 } ( 2001 ) 7081 ] , relate it to local operations on maximally entangled vectors bases , find an invariant for equivalence classes in terms of certain commuting systems , and , relate it to mutually unbiased bases and hadamard matrices . illustrations are given in the context of latin squares and projective representations as well . applications to quantum tomography are indicated .
