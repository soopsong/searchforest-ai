we study the spontaneous decay of an impurity coupled to a linear array of bosonic cavities forming a single - band photonic waveguide . the average frequency of the emitted photon is different from the frequency for single - photon resonant scattering , which perfectly matches the bare frequency of the excited state of the impurity . we study how the energy of the excited state of the impurity influences the spatial profile of the emitted photon . the farther the energy is from the middle of the photonic band , the farther the wave packet is from the causal limit . in particular , if the energy lies in the middle of the band , the wave packet is localized around the causal limit . besides , the occupation of the excited state of the impurity presents a rich dynamics : it shows an exponential decay up to intermediate times , this is followed by a power - law tail in the long - time regime , and it finally reaches an oscillatory stationary regime . finally , we show that this phenomenology is robust under the presence of losses , both in the impurity and the cavities .
