we carry out adm splitting in the lagrangian formulation and establish a procedure in which ( almost ) all of the unphysical components of the metric are removed by using the 4d diffeomorphism and the measure - zero 3d symmetry . the procedure introduces a constraint that corresponds to the hamiltonian constraint of the hamiltonian formulation , and its solution implies that the 4d dynamics admits an effective description through 3d hypersurface physics . as far as we can see , our procedure implies potential renormalizability of { the adm formulation of } 4d einstein gravity for which a complete gauge - fixing in the adm formulation and hypersurface foliation of geometry are the key elements . if true , this implies that the alleged unrenormalizability of 4d einstein gravity may be due to the presence of the unphysical fields . the procedure can straightforwardly be applied to quantization around a flat background ; the schwarzschild case seems more subtle . we discuss a potential limitation of the procedure when applying it to explicit time - dependent backgrounds .
