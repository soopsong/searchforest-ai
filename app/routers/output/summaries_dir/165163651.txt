we derive a lindblad master equation that approximates the dynamics of a lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model weakly coupled to a bosonic bath . by studying the time evolution of operators under the adjoint master equation we prove that , for large system sizes , these operators attain their thermal equilibrium expectation values in the long - time limit , and we calculate the rate at which these values are approached . integrability of the lmg model prevents thermalization in the absence of a bath , and our work provides an explicit proof that the bath indeed restores thermalization . imposing thermalization on this otherwise non - thermalizing model outlines an avenue towards probing the unconventional thermodynamic properties predicted to occur in ultracold - atom - based realizations of the lmg model .
