in this work we explore a correspondence between quantum circuits and low - degree polynomials over the finite field f_2 . any quantum circuit made up of hadamard , z , controlled - z and controlled - controlled - z gates gives rise to a degree-3 polynomial over f_2 such that calculating quantum circuit amplitudes is equivalent to counting zeroes of the corresponding polynomial . we exploit this connection , which is especially clean and simple for this particular gate set , in two directions . first , we give proofs of classical hardness results based on quantum circuit concepts . second , we find efficient classical simulation algorithms for certain classes of quantum circuits based on efficient algorithms for classes of polynomials .
