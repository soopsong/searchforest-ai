the optimal properties for single photons may vary drastically between different quantum technologies . along with central frequency conversion , control over photonic temporal waveforms will be paramount to the effective coupling of different quantum systems and efficient distribution of quantum information . through the application of pulse shaping and the nonlinear optical process of sum - frequency generation , we examine a framework for manipulation of single - photon waveforms . we use a non - perturbative treatment to determine the parameter regime in which both high - efficiency and high - fidelity conversion may be achieved for gaussian waveforms and study the effect such conversion techniques have on energy - time entanglement . additionally , we prove that aberrations due to time ordering are negligible when the phasematching is nonrestrictive over the input bandwidths . our calculations show that ideal quantum optical waveform conversion and quantum time lensing may be fully realized using these techniques .
