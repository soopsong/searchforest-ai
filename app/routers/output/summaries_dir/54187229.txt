we propose the continuous - variable quantum key distribution protocol based on the gaussian modulation of a single quadrature of the coherent states of light , which is aimed to provide simplified implementation compared to the symmetrically modulated gaussian coherent - state protocols . the protocol waives the necessity in phase quadrature modulation and the corresponding channel transmittance estimation . the security of the protocol against collective attacks in a generally phase - sensitive gaussian channels is analyzed and is shown achievable upon certain conditions . robustness of the protocol to channel imperfections is compared to that of the symmetrical coherent - state protocol . the simplified unidimensional protocol is shown possible at a reasonable quantitative cost in terms of key rate and of tolerable channel excess noise .
