the entanglement dynamics of a laser - pumped two - level quantum dot pair is investigated in the steady - state . the closely spaced two - level emitters , embedded in a semiconductor substrate , interact with both the environmental vacuum modes of the electromagnetic field reservoir as well as with the lattice vibrational phonon thermostat . we have found that the entanglement among the pair 's components is substantially enhanced due to presence of the phonon subsystem . the reason is phonon induced decay among the symmetrical and antisymmetrical two - qubit collective states and , consequently , the population of the latter one . this also means that through thermal phonon bath engineering one can access the subradiant two - particle cooperative state .
