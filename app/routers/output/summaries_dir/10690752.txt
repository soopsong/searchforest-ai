we derive a coupled mode theory for the interaction of an optical cavity with a waveguide that includes waveguide dispersion . the theory can be applied to photonic crystal cavity waveguide structures . we derive an analytical solution to the add and drop spectra arising from such interactions in the limit of linear dispersion . in this limit , the spectra can accurately predict the cold cavity quality factor ( q ) when the interaction is weak . we numerically solve the coupled mode equations for the case of a cavity interacting with the band edge of a periodic waveguide , where linear dispersion is no longer a good approximation . in this regime , the density of states can distort the add and drop spectra . this distortion can lead to more than an order of magnitude overestimation of the cavity q.
