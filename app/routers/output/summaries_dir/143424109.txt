in this paper , we are exploring the feasibility of observing non - classical features of gravity in a low - energy regime in a quantum optomechanical experiment . if gravity is to have an underlying quantum nature , it should hold the most fundamental quantum characteristics such as the superposition principle and entanglement . despite the weakness of gravity , in principle there is a chance , to observe such a quantum signature of the gravity by exploiting the quantum optomechanical techniques , without direct observation of graviton . we are investigating a new dynamical scheme called , gravitational quantum regime , in which the source of gravity is a quantum particle , and its centre of mass is subject to the spatial superposition . in a gedankenexperiment , a test particle is gravitationally interacting with a quantum nanoparticle in a double - slit setup . possible entanglement or superposition of the fields is investigated . we are looking for the corresponding deviation of the classical description of gravity despite being far from the planck scale . any experimental interrogation which reveals that gravitational field obeys the quantum superposition principle would be the first recognition of quantumness of gravity . this study will show how feasible it is to search for a non - classical feature of gravity in such a regime of motion . moreover , this proposal would be an attempt to test the objectivity of the quantum superposition principle and its contribution to the microstructure of space - time .
