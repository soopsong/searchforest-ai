a quantum channel from a system $ a$ of dimension $ d_a$ to a system $ b$ of dimension $ d_b$ is a completely positive trace - preserving map from complex $ d_a\times d_a$ to $ d_b\times d_b$ matrices , and the set of all such maps with kraus rank $ r$ has the structure of a smooth manifold . we describe this set in two ways . first , as a quotient space of ( a subset of ) the $ rd_b\times d_a$ dimensional stiefel manifold . secondly , as the set of all choi - states of a fixed rank $ r$. these two descriptions are topologically equivalent . this allows us to show that the set of all choi - states corresponding to extreme channels from system $ a$ to system $ b$ of a fixed kraus rank $ r$ is a smooth submanifold of dimension $ 2rd_ad_b - d_a^2-r^2 $ of the set of all choi - states of rank $ r$. as an application , we derive a lower bound on the number of parameters required for a quantum circuit topology to be able to approximate all extreme channels from $ a$ to $ b$ arbitrarily well .
