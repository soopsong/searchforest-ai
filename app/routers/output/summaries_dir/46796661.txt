we report on quantum frequency conversion of near - infrared photons from a wavelength of 854 nm to the telecommunication o - band at 1310 nm with 8 % overall conversion efficiency . entangled photon pairs at 854 nm are generated via type - ii spontaneous parametric down conversion . one photon is mixed with a strong pump field in a nonlinear ridge waveguide for its conversion to 1310 nm . we demonstrate preservation of first and second order coherence of the photons in the conversion process . based on this we infer the coherence function of the two - photon state and compare it with the actual measured one . this measurement demonstrates preservation of time - energy entanglement of the pair . with 88 % visibility we violate a bell inequality .
