153eu3+:y2sio5 is a very attractive candidate for a long lived , multimode quantum memory due to the long spin coherence time ( ~15 ms ) , the relatively large hyperfine splitting ( 100 mhz ) and the narrow optical homogeneous linewidth ( ~100 hz ) . here we show an atomic frequency comb memory with spin wave storage in a promising material 153eu3+:y2sio5 , reaching storage times slightly beyond 10 { \mu}s . we analyze the efficiency of the storage process and discuss ways of improving it . we also measure the inhomogeneous spin linewidth of 153eu3+:y2sio5 , which we find to be 69 \pm 3 khz . these results represent a further step towards realising a long lived multi mode solid state quantum memory .
