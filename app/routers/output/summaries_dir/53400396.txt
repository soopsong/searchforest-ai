long - range quantum communication for spin qubits is an important open problem . here we study decoherence of an electron spin qubit that is being transported in a moving quantum dot . we focus on spin decoherence due to spin - orbit interaction and a random electric potential . we find that at the lowest order , the motion induces longitudinal spin relaxation , with a rate linear in the dot velocity . our calculated spin relaxation time ranges from sub $ \mu$s in gaas to above ms in si , making this relaxation a significant decoherence channel . our results also give clear indications on how to reduce the decoherence effect of electron motion .
