a which - way measurement in young 's double - slit will destroy the interference pattern . bohr claimed this complementarity between wave- and particle behaviour is enforced by heisenberg 's uncertainty principle : distinguishing two positions a distance s apart transfers a random momentum q \sim \hbar / s to the particle . this claim has been subject to debate : scully et al . asserted that in some situations interference can be destroyed with no momentum transfer , while storey et al . asserted that bohr 's stance is always valid . we address this issue using the experimental technique of weak measurement . we measure a distribution for q that spreads well beyond [ -\hbar / s , \hbar / s ] , but nevertheless has a variance consistent with zero . this weakvalued momentum - transfer distribution p_{wv}(q ) thus reflects both sides of the debate .
