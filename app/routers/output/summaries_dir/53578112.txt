we consider the problem of a central spin with arbitrary spin s that interacts pairwise and uniformly with a bath of n spins with s=1/2 . we present two approaches for determining the exact spectrum of this model , one based on properties of su(2 ) , and the other based on integrability . we also analyze the exact time evolution of a spin coherent state , and compute the time evolution of various quantities of physical interest , including the entanglement entropy , spin polarization and loschmidt echo .
