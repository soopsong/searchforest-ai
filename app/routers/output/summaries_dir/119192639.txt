turbulent airflow in the atmosphere and the resulting random fluctuations in its refractive index have long been known as a major cause of image deterioration in astronomical imaging and figures among the obstacles for reliable optical communication when information is encoded in the spatial profile of a laser beam . here we show that using correlation imaging and a suitably prepared source of photon pairs , the most severe of the disturbances inflicted on the beam by turbulence can be cancelled out . other than a two - photon light source , only linear passive optical elements are needed and , as opposed to adaptive optics techniques , our scheme does not rely on active wavefront correction .
