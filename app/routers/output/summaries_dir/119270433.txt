the dynamics of the survival probability of quantum walkers on a one - dimensional lattice with random distribution of absorbing immobile traps are investigated . the survival probability of quantum walkers is compared with that of classical walkers . it is shown that the time dependence of survival probability of quantum walkers has a piecewise stretched exponential character depending on the density of traps in numerical and analytical observations . the crossover between the quantum analogs of the rosenstock and donsker - varadhan behaviors is identified .
