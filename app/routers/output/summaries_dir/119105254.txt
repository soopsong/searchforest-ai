we study the entanglement spectrum of a chern insulator on a cylinder geometry , with the cut separating the two partitions taken parallel to the cylinder edge , at varying distances from the edge . in contrast to similar studies on a torus , there is only one cut , and hence only one virtual edge mode in the entanglement spectrum . the entanglement spectrum has a gap when the cut is close enough to the physical edge of the cylinder such that the edge mode spatially extends over the cut . this effect is suppressed for parameter choices where the edge mode is sharply localized at the edge . in the extreme case of a perfectly localized edge mode , the entanglement spectrum is gapless even if the smaller partition consists of a single edge row . for the single - row cut , we construct the corresponding entanglement hamiltonian , which is a one - dimensional tight - binding hamiltonian with complex long - range hopping and interesting properties . we also study and explain the effect of two different schemes of flux insertion through a ring described by such an entanglement hamiltonian .
