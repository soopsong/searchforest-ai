the performance characteristics of a heat rectifier and a heat pump are studied in a non markovian framework . the device is constructed from a molecule connected to a hot and cold reservoir . the heat baths are modelled using the stochastic surrogate hamiltonian method . the molecule is modelled by an asymmetric double - well potential . each well is semi - locally connected to a heat bath composed of spins . the dynamics is driven by a combined system - bath hamiltonian . the temperature of the baths is regulated by a secondary spin bath composed of identical spins in thermal equilibrium . a random swap operation exchange spins between the primary and secondary baths . the combined system is studied in various system - bath coupling strengths . in all cases the average heat current always flows from the hot towards the cold bath in accordance to the second law of thermodynamics . the asymmetry of the double well generates a rectifying effect meaning that when the left and right baths are exchanged the heat current follows the hot to cold direction . the heat current is larger when the high frequency is coupled to the hot bath . adding an external driving field can reverse the transport direction . such a refrigeration effect is modelled by a periodic driving field in resonance with the frequency difference of the two potential wells . a minimal driving amplitude is required to overcome the heat leak effect . in the strong driving regime the cooling power is non - monotonic with the system - bath coupling .
