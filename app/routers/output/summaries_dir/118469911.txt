a dilutely filled $ n$-site optical lattice near zero temperature within a high-$q$ multimode cavity can be mapped to a spin ensemble with tailorable interactions at all length scales . the effective full site to site interaction matrix can be dynamically controlled by the application of up to $ n(n+1)/2 $ laser beams of suitable geometry , frequency and power , which allows for the implementation of quantum annealing dynamics relying on the all - to - all effective spin coupling controllable in real time . via an adiabatic sweep starting from a superfluid initial state one can find the lowest energy stationary state of this system . as the cavity modes are lossy , errors can be amended and the ground state can still be reached even from a finite temperature state via ground state cavity cooling . the physical properties of the final atomic state can be directly and almost non - destructively read off from the cavity output fields . as example we simulate a quantum hopfield associative memory scheme .
