we approach the problem of finding generalized states for matter fields in a de sitter universe , moving from a group theoretical point of view . this has profound consequences for cosmological perturbations during inflation , and for other cmb observables . in a systematic derivation , we find all the allowed generalities that such a state may have , within the requirements of coherent states . furthermore , we show their relation to the more familiar excited initial states , often used in inflation .
