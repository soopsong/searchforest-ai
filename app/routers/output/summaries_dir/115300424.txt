cavity cooling via quantum backaction force can extract thermal fluctuations from a mechanical resonator to reach the quantum ground state . surface or bulk two - level - system ( tls ) defects in a mechanical resonator can couple with the mechanical mode via deformation potential and affect the cooling process significantly . here , we develop a theory to study the cavity cooling of a mechanical mode in the presence of a tls defect using the adiabatic elimination technique . our result shows that the cooling process depends strongly on the resonance and the damping rate of the tls .
