the firewall paradox states that an observer falling into an old black hole must see a violation of unitarity , locality , or the equivalence principle . motivated by this remarkable conflict , we analyze the causal structure of black hole spacetimes in order to determine whether all the necessary ingredients for the paradox fit within a single observer 's causal patch . we particularly focus on the question of whether the interior partner modes of the outgoing hawking quanta can , in principle , be measured by an infalling observer . since the relevant modes are spread over the entire sphere , we answer a simple geometrical question : can any observer see an entire sphere behind the horizon ? we find that for all static black holes in 3 + 1 and higher dimensions , with any value of the cosmological constant , no single observer can see both the early hawking radiation and the interior modes . we present a detailed description of the causal patch geometry of the schwarzschild black hole in 3 + 1 dimensions , where an infalling observer comes closest to being able to measure the relevant modes .
