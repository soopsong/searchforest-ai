this paper considers the problem of constructing a direct coupling quantum observer for a single qubit finite level quantum system plant . the proposed observer is a single mode linear quantum system which is shown to be able to estimate one of the plant variables in a time averaged sense . a numerical example and simulations are included to illustrate the properties of the observer .
