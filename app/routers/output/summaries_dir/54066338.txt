in the usual optomechanical cooling , even if the system has no thermal component , it still has a quantum limit - known as the quantum backaction limit ( qbl)-on the minimum phonon number related to shot noise . by studying the side - band cooling regime in optomechanical system ( oms ) , we find that the cooling can be improved significantly when the frequency modulation ( fm ) that can suppress the stokes heating processes is introduced into the system . we analyze and demonstrate the reasons of the phonon number below the qbl redefined in the whole stable region of the standard omss . the above analyses are further checked by numerically solving the differential equations of second order moments derived from the quantum master equation with broad system parameters , ranging from weak coupling ( wc ) to ultra - strong coupling ( usc ) and resolved side - band ( rsb ) to unresolved side - band ( usb ) regimes . comparing with the cases of those without fm , the stable ground - state cooling can also be achieved even in the conventional unstable region .
