we analyze hawking radiation as perceived by a freely - falling observer and try to draw an inference about the region of origin of the hawking quanta . to do so , first we calculate the energy density from the stress energy tensor , as perceived by a freely - falling observer . then we compare this with the energy density computed from an effective temperature functional which depends on the state of the observer . the two ways of computing these quantities show a mismatch at the light ring outside the black hole horizon . to better understand this ambiguity , we show that even taking into account the ( minor ) breakdown of the adiabatic evolution of the temperature functional which has a peak in the same region of the mismatch , is not enough to remove it . we argue that the appearance of this discrepancy can be traced back to the process of particle creation by showing how the wentzel -- kramers -- brillouin approximation for the field modes breaks down between the light ring at $ 3m$ and $ 4m$ , with a peak at $ r=3.3m$ exactly where the energy density mismatch is maximized . we hence conclude that these facts strongly support a scenario where the hawking flux does originate from a"quantum atmosphere"located well outside the black hole horizon .
