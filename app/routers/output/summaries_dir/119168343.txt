the linear and the nonlinear non - markovian quantum state diffusion equation ( nmqsd ) are well known tools for the description of certain non - markovian open quantum systems . in this work , we systematically investigate whether the normalized linear nmqsd or the nonlinear nmqsd solutions can be generated by means of a time - continuous measurement . by considering any conceivable measurement scheme in the framework of instruments , we derive a necessary criterion for a measurement interpretation of both equations . concrete examples show that the normalized linear nmqsd solutions are realizable only in the markovian limit in general . the application of the presented criterion to the nonlinear nmqsd remains an open issue .
