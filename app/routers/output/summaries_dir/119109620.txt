in this paper we treat the black hole horizon as a physical boundary to the spacetime and study its dynamics following from the gibbons - hawking - york boundary term . using the kerr black hole as an example we derive an effective action that describes , in the large wave number limit , a massless klein - gordon field living on the average location of the boundary . complete solutions can be found in the small rotation limit of the black hole . the formulation suggests that the boundary can be treated in the same way as any other matter contributions . in particular , the angular momentum of the boundary matches exactly with that of the black hole , suggesting an interesting possibility that all charges ( including the entropy ) of the black hole are carried by the boundary . using this as input , we derive predictions on the planck scale properties of the boundary .
