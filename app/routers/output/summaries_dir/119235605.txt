the generation of quantum entanglement of macroscopic or mesoscopic bodies in mechanical motion is generally bounded by the thermal fluctuation exerted by their environments . here we propose a scheme to establish stationary entanglement between two mechanically oscillating mirrors of a cavity . it is revealed that , by applying a broadband squeezed laser acting as a squeezed - vacuum reservoir to the cavity , a stable entanglement between the mechanical mirrors can be generated . using the adiabatic elimination and master equation methods , we analytically find that the generated entanglement is essentially determined by the squeezing of the relative momentum of the mechanical mirrors , which is transferred from the squeezed reservoir through the cavity . numerical verification indicates that our scheme is within the present experimental state of the art of optomechanics .
