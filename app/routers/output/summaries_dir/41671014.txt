we numerically study silicon waveguides on silica showing that it is possible to simultaneously guide optical and acoustic waves in the technologically important silicon on insulator ( soi ) material system . thin waveguides , or fins , exhibit geometrically softened mechanical modes at gigahertz frequencies with phase velocities below the rayleigh velocity in glass , eliminating acoustic radiation losses . we propose slot waveguides on glass with telecom optical frequencies and strong radiation pressure forces resulting in brillouin gains on the order of 500 and 50,000 1/(wm ) for backward and forward brillouin scattering , respectively .
