over the past decade , machine learning techniques have revolutionized how research is done , from designing new materials and predicting their properties to assisting drug discovery to advancing cybersecurity . recently , we added to this list by showing how a machine learning algorithm ( a so - called learner ) combined with an optimization routine can assist experimental efforts in the realm of tuning semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) devices . among other applications , semiconductor qds are a candidate system for building quantum computers . the present - day tuning techniques for bringing the qd devices into a desirable configuration suitable for quantum computing that rely on heuristics do not scale with the increasing size of the quantum dot arrays required for even near - term quantum computing demonstrations . establishing a reliable protocol for tuning that does not rely on the gross - scale heuristics developed by experimentalists is thus of great importance . to implement the machine learning - based approach , we constructed a dataset of simulated qd device characteristics , such as the conductance and the charge sensor response versus the applied electrostatic gate voltages . here , we describe the methodology for generating the dataset , as well as its validation in training convolutional neural networks . we show that the learner 's accuracy in recognizing the state of a device is ~96.5 % in both current- and charge - sensor - based training . we also introduce a tool that enables other researchers to use this approach for further research : qflow lite - a python - based mini - software suite that uses the dataset to train neural networks to recognize the state of a device and differentiate between states in experimental data . this work gives the definitive reference for the new dataset that will help enable researchers to use it in their experiments or to develop new machine learning approaches and concepts .
