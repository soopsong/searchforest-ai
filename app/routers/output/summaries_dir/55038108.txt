in this paper , we provide an operational criterion for controlled dense coding with a general class of three - qubit partially entangled states . a general three - qubit pure entangled state can be classified into two inequivalent classes according to their genuine tripartite entanglement . we claim that if a three - qubit state shows entanglement characteristic similar to $ ghz$-class then such non - trivial tripartite states are useful in { \it controlled dense coding } whereas states belonging to $ w$-class are not useful for that . we start with a particular class of non - trivial partially entangled states belonging to $ ghz$-class and show that they are effective in controlled dense coding . then we cite several other examples of different types of tripartite entangled states to support our conjecture .
