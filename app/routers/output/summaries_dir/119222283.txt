in blind quantum computation ( bqc ) , a client delegates her quantum computation to a server with universal quantum computers who learns nothing about the client 's private information . in measurement - based bqc model , entangled states are generally used to realize quantum computing . however , to generate a large - scale entangled state in experiment becomes a challenge issue . in circuit - based bqc model , single - qubit gates can be realized precisely , but entangled gates are probabilistically successful . this remains a challenge to realize entangled gates with a deterministic method in some systems . to solve above two problems , we propose the first hybrid universal bqc protocol based on measurements and circuits , where the client prepares single - qubit states and the server performs universal quantum computing . we analyze and prove the correctness , blindness and verifiability of the proposed protocol .
