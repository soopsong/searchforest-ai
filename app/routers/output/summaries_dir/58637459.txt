with the emergence of the field of quantum communications , the appropriate choice of photonic degrees of freedom used for encoding information is of paramount importance . highly precise techniques for measuring the polarisation , frequency , and arrival time of a photon have been developed . however , the transverse spatial degree of freedom still lacks a measurement scheme that allows the reconstruction of its full transverse structure with a simple implementation and a high level of accuracy . here we show a method to measure the azimuthal and radial modes of laguerre - gaussian beams with a greater than 99 % accuracy , using a single phase screen . we compare our technique with previous commonly used methods and demonstrate the significant improvements it presents for quantum key distribution and state tomography of high - dimensional quantum states of light . moreover , our technique can be readily extended to any arbitrary family of spatial modes , such as mutually unbiased bases , hermite - gauss , and ince - gauss . our scheme will significantly enhance existing quantum and classical communication protocols that use the spatial structure of light , as well as enable fundamental experiments on spatial - mode entanglement to reach their full potential .
