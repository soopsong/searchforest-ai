the superadiabatic quantum driving , producing a perfect adiabatic transfer on a given hamitonian by introducing an additional hamiltonian , is theoretically analysed for transfers within a three - level system . our starting point is the stimulated raman adiabatic passage , realized through different schemes of laser pulses . we determine the superadiabatic correction for each scheme . the fidelity , robustness and transfer time of all the superadiabatic transfer schemes are discussed . we derive that all superadiabatic corrections are based on a $ \pi$- ( or near-$\pi$)-area pulse coupling between the initial and final states . the benefits in the protocol robustness overcome the difficulties associated to the actual implementation of the three - level superadiabatic transfer .
