this paper considers a popov type approach to the problem of robust stability for a class of uncertain linear quantum systems subject to unknown perturbations in the system hamiltonian . a general stability result is given for a general class of perturbations to the system hamiltonian . then , the special case of a nominal linear quantum system is considered with quadratic perturbations to the system hamiltonian . in this case , a robust stability condition is given in terms of a frequency domain condition which is of the same form as the standard popov stability condition .
