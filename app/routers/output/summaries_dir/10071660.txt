numerical simulation of individual open quantum systems has proven advantages over density operator computations . quantum state diffusion with a moving basis ( mqsd ) provides a practical numerical simulation method which takes full advantage of the localization of quantum states into wave packets occupying small regions of classical phase space . following and extending the original proposal of percival , alber and steimle , we show that mqsd can provide a further gain over ordinary qsd and other quantum trajectory methods of many orders of magnitude in computational space and time . because of these gains , it is even possible to calculate an open quantum system trajectory when the corresponding isolated system is intractable . mqsd is particularly advantageous where classical or semiclassical dynamics provides an adequate qualitative picture but is numerically inaccurate because of significant quantum effects . the principles are illustrated by computations for the quantum duffing oscillator and for second harmonic generation in quantum optics . potential applications in atomic and molecular dynamics , quantum circuits and quantum computation are suggested .
