we investigate quantum entanglement of gravitational configurations in 3d ads gravity using the ads / cft correspondence . we derive explicit formulas for the holographic entanglement entropy ( ee ) of the btz black hole , conical singularities and regularized ads$_{3}$. the leading term in the large temperature expansion of the holographic ee of the btz black hole reproduces exactly its bekenstein - hawking entropy s_bh , whereas the subleading term behaves as ln s_bh . we also show that the leading term of the holographic ee for the btz black hole can be obtained from the large temperature expansion of the partition function of a broad class of 2d cfts on the torus . this result indicates that black hole ee is not a fundamental feature of the underlying theory of quantum gravity but emerges when the semiclassical notion of spacetime geometry is used to describe the black hole .
