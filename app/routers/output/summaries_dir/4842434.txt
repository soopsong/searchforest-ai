structural approximations to positive , but not completely positive maps are approximate physical realizations of these non - physical maps . they find applications in the design of direct entanglement detection methods . we show that many of these approximations , in the relevant case of optimal positive maps , define an entanglement breaking channel and , consequently , can be implemented via a measurement and state - preparation protocol . we also show how our findings can be useful for the design of better and simpler direct entanglement detection methods .
