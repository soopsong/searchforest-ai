we analyze the constraints of gauge theories on kerr and kerr - de sitter spacetimes , which contain one or more horizons . we find that the constraints are modified on such backgrounds through the presence of additional surface terms at the horizons . as a concrete example , we consider the maxwell field and find that the gauss law constraint involves surface corrections at the horizons . these surface contributions correspond to induced surface charges and currents on the horizons , which agree with those found within the membrane paradigm . the modification of the gauss law constraint also influences the gauge fixing and dirac brackets of the theory .
