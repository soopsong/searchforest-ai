quantum error - correcting codes are used to protect qubits involved in quantum computation . this process requires logical operators , acting on protected qubits , to be translated into physical operators ( circuits ) acting on physical quantum states . we propose a mathematical framework for synthesizing physical circuits that implement logical clifford operators for stabilizer codes . circuit synthesis is enabled by representing the desired physical clifford operator in $ \mathbb{c}^{n \times n}$ as a partial $ 2 m \times 2m$ binary symplectic matrix , where $ n = 2^m$. we state and prove two theorems that use symplectic transvections to efficiently enumerate all binary symplectic matrices that satisfy a system of linear equations . as a corollary of these results , we prove that for an $ [ \ ! [ m , k ] \!]$ stabilizer code every logical clifford operator has $ 2^{r(r+1)/2}$ symplectic solutions , where $ r = m - k$ , up to stabilizer degeneracy . the desired physical circuits are then obtained by decomposing each solution into a product of elementary symplectic matrices , that correspond to elementary circuits . this enumeration of all physical realizations enables optimization over the ensemble with respect to a suitable metric . furthermore , we show that any circuit that normalizes the stabilizer of the code can be transformed into a circuit that centralizes the stabilizer , while realizing the same logical operation . our method of circuit synthesis can be applied to any stabilizer code , and this paper discusses a proof of concept synthesis for the $ [ \ ! [ 6,4,2 ] \!]$ css code . programs implementing the algorithms in this paper , which includes routines to solve for binary symplectic solutions of general linear systems and our overall lcs ( logical circuit synthesis ) algorithm , can be found at : https://github.com/nrenga/symplectic-arxiv18a
