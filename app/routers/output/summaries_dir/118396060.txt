we present two realistic entanglement concentration protocols ( ecps ) for pure partially entangled photons . a partially entangled photon pair can be concentrated to a maximally entangled pair with only an ancillary single photon in a certain probability , while the conventional ones require two copies of partially entangled pairs at least . our first protocol is implemented with linear optics and the second one is implemented with cross - kerr nonlinearities . compared with other ecps , they do not need to know the accurate coefficients of the initial state . with linear optics , it is feasible with current experiment . with cross - kerr nonlinearities , it does not require the sophisticated single - photon detectors and can be repeated to get a higher success probability . moreover , the second protocol can get the higher entanglement transformation efficiency and it maybe the most economical one by far . meanwhile , both of protocols are more suitable for multi - photon system concentration , because they need less operations and classical communications . all these advantages make two protocols be useful in current long - distance quantum communications .
