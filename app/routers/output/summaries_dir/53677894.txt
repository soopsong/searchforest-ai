time crystals in periodically driven systems have initially been studied assuming either the ability to quench the hamiltonian between different many - body regimes , the presence of disorder or long - range interactions . here we propose the simplest scheme to observe discrete time crystal dynamics in a one - dimensional driven quantum system of the ising type with short - range interactions and no disorder . the system is subject only to a periodic kick by a global magnetic field , and no extra hamiltonian quenching is performed . we analyze the emerging time crystal stabilizing mechanisms via extensive numerics as well as using an analytic approach based on an off - resonant transition model . due to the simplicity of the driven ising model , our proposal can be implemented with current experimental platforms including trapped ions , rydberg atoms , and superconducting circuits .
