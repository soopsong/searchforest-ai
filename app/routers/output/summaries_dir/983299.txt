computing the coefficients of an exterior product of two - forms of rank two is # p - hard . specifically , a permanent of a nxn matrix may be expressed as an exterior product of n^2 two - forms of rank two in dimension 2n^2 . in the context of quantum computing , such exterior products describe multi - particle scattering amplitudes of non - interacting fermions initially prepared in entangled states .
