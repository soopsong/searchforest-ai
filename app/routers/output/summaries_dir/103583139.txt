a number of non - markovian stochastic schr\"odinger equations , ranging from the numerically exact hierarchical form towards a series of perturbative expressions sequentially presented in an ascending degrees of approximations are revisited in this short review , aiming at providing a systematic framework which is capable to connect different kinds of the wavefunction - based approaches for an open system coupled to the harmonic bath . one can optimistically expect the extensive future applications of those non - markovian stochastic schr\"odinger equations in large - scale realistic complex systems , benefiting from their favorable scaling with respect to the system size , the stochastic nature which is extremely suitable for parallel computing , and many other distinctive advantages . in addition , we have presented a few examples showing the excitation energy transfer in fenna - matthews - olson complex , a quantitative measure of decoherence timescale of hot exciton , and the study of quantum interference effects upon the singlet fission processes in organic materials , since a deep understanding of both mechanisms is very important to explore the underlying microscopic processes and to provide novel design principles for highly efficient organic photovoltaics .
