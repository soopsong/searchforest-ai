the evaporation of black holes raises a number of conceptual issues , most of them related to the final stages of evaporation , where the interplay between the central singularity and hawking radiation can not be ignored . regular models of black holes replace the central singularity with a nonsingular spacetime region , in which an effective classical geometric description is available . it has been argued that these models provide an effective , but complete , description of the evaporation of black holes at all times up to their eventual disappearance . however , here we point out that known models fail to be self - consistent : the regular core is exponentially unstable against perturbations with a finite timescale , while the evaporation time is infinite , therefore making the instability impossible to prevent . we also discuss how to overcome these difficulties , highlighting that this can be done only at the price of accepting that these models can not be fully predictive regarding the final stages of evaporation .
