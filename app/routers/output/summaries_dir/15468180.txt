we derive an exact expression for the quantumness of a hilbert space ( defined in quant - ph/0302092 ) , and show that in composite hilbert spaces the signal states must contain at least some entangled states in order to achieve such a sensitivity . furthermore , we establish that the accessible fidelity for symmetric informationally complete signal ensembles is equal to the quantumness . though spelling the most trouble for an eavesdropper because of this , it turns out that the accessible fidelity is nevertheless easy for her to achieve in this case : any measurement consisting of rank - one povm elements is an optimal measurement , and the simple procedure of reproducing the projector associated with the measurement outcome is an optimal output strategy . two and epsilon elevator stories are added for entertainment .
