we propose a reconstruction of general bulk surfaces in any dimension in terms of the differential entropy in the boundary field theory . in particular , we extend the proof of headrick et al . to calculate the area of a general class of surfaces , which have a 1-parameter foliation over a closed manifold . the area can be written in terms of extremal surfaces whose boundaries lie on ring - like regions in the field theory . we discuss when this construction has a description in terms of spatial entanglement entropy and suggest lessons for a more complete and covariant approach .
