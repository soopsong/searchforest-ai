matchgates are a restricted set of two - qubit gates known to be classically simulable when acting on nearest - neighbor qubits on a path , but universal for quantum computation when the qubits are arranged on certain other graphs . here we characterize the power of matchgates acting on arbitrary graphs . specifically , we show that they are universal on any connected graph other than a path or a cycle , and that they are classically simulable on a cycle . we also prove the same dichotomy for the xy interaction , a proper subset of matchgates related to some implementations of quantum computing .
