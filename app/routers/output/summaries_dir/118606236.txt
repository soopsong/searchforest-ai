we describe the implementation of laser - cooled silica microspheres as force sensors in a dual - beam optical dipole trap in high vacuum . using this system we have demonstrated trap lifetimes exceeding several days , attonewton force detection capability , and wide tunability in trapping and cooling parameters . measurements have been performed with charged and neutral beads to calibrate the sensitivity of the detector . this work establishes the suitability of dual beam optical dipole traps for precision force measurement in high vacuum with long averaging times , and enables future applications including the study of gravitational inverse square law violations at short range , casimir forces , acceleration sensing , and quantum opto - mechanics .
