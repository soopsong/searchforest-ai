syndrome measurements made in quantum error correction contain more information than is typically used . we show that the statistics of data from syndrome measurements can be used to do the following : ( i ) estimation of parameters of an error channel , including the ability correct away the invertible part of the error channel , once it is estimated ; ( ii ) hypothesis testing ( or model selection ) to distinguish error channels , e.g. , to determine if the errors are correlated . the unifying theme is to make use of all of the information in the statistics of the data collected from syndrome measurements using machine learning and control algorithms .
