we theoretically investigate the dynamical casimir effect in electrical circuits based on superconducting microfabricated waveguides with tunable boundary conditions . we propose to implement a rapid modulation of the boundary conditions by tuning the applied magnetic flux through superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) that are embedded in the waveguide circuits . we consider two circuits : ( i ) an open waveguide circuit that corresponds to a single mirror in free space , and ( ii ) a resonator coupled to a microfabricated waveguide , which corresponds to a single - sided cavity in free space . we analyze the properties of the dynamical casimir effect in these two setups by calculating the generated photon - flux density , output - field correlation functions , and the quadrature squeezing spectra . we show that these properties of the output field exhibit signatures unique to the radiation due to the dynamical casimir effect , and could therefore be used for distinguishing the dynamical casimir effect from other types of radiation in these circuits . we also discuss the similarities and differences between the dynamical casimir effect , in the resonator setup , and downconversion of pump photons in parametric oscillators .
