we study the applicability of collisional models for non - markovian dynamics of open quantum systems . by allowing interactions between the separate environmental degrees of freedom in between collisions we are able to construct a collision model that allows to study quantum memory effects in open system dynamics . we also discuss the possibility to embed non - markovian collision model dynamics into markovian collision model dynamics in an extended state space . as a concrete example we show how using the proposed class of collision models we can discretely model non- markovian amplitude damping of a qubit . in the time - continuous limit , we obtain the well - known results for spontaneous decay of a two level system in to a structured zero - temperature reservoir
