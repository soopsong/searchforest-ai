using the axiomatic definition of the coherence measure , such as the $ l_{1}$ norm and the relative entropy , we study the phenomena of two - qubit system quantum coherence through quantum channels where successive uses of the channels are memory . different types of noisy channels with memory , such as amplitude damping , phase - damping , and depolarizing channels effect on quantum coherence have been discussed in detail . the results show that , quantum channels with memory can efficiently protect coherence from noisy channels . particularly , as channels with perfect memory , quantum coherence is unaffected by the phase damping as well as depolarizing channels . besides , we also investigate the cohering and decohering power of quantum channels with memory .
