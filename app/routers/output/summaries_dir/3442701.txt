vector vortex beams are structured states of light that are non - separable in their polarisation and spatial mode , they are eigenmodes of free - space and many fibre systems , and have the capacity to be used as a modal basis for both classical and quantum communication . here we outline recent progress in our understanding of these modes , from their creation to their characterization and detection . we then use these tools to study the propagation behaviour of such modes in free - space and optical fibre and show that modal cross - talk results in a decay of vector states into separable scalar modes , with a concomitant loss of information . we present a comparison between probabilistic and deterministic detection schemes showing that the former , while ubiquitous , negates the very benefit of increased dimensionality in quantum communication while reducing signal in classical communication links . this work provides a useful introduction to the field as well as presenting new findings and perspectives to advance it further .
