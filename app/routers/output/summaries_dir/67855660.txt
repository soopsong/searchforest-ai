we first show that under seth and its variant , strong and weak classical simulations of quantum computing are impossible in certain double - exponential time of the circuit depth . we next show that under orthogonal vectors , 3-sum , and their variants , strong and weak classical simulations of quantum computing are impossible in certain exponential time of the number of qubits .
