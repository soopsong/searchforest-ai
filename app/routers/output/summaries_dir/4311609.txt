entanglement is a fundamental resource in quantum information processing . several studies have explored the integration of sources of entangled states on a silicon chip but the sources demonstrated so far require millimeter lengths and pump powers of the order of hundreds of mws to produce an appreciable photon flux , hindering their scalability and dense integration . microring resonators have been shown to be efficient sources of photon pairs , but entangled state emission has never been demonstrated . here we report the first demonstration of a microring resonator capable of emitting time - energy entangled photons . we use a franson experiment to show a violation of bell 's inequality by as much as 11 standard deviations . the source is integrated on a silicon chip , operates at sub - mw pump power , emits in the telecom band with a pair generation rate exceeding 10$^7 $ hz per $ nm$ , and outputs into a photonic waveguide . these are all essential features of an entangled states emitter for a quantum photonic networks .
