the implementation and engineering of bright and coherent solid state quantum light sources is key for the realization of both on chip and remote quantum networks . despite tremendous efforts for more than 15 years , the combination of these two key prerequisites in a single , potentially scalable device is a major challenge . here , we report on the observation of bright and coherent single photon emission generated via pulsed , resonance fluorescence conditions from a single quantum dot ( qd ) deterministically centered in a micropillar cavity device via cryogenic optical lithography . the brightness of the qd fluorescence is greatly enhanced on resonance with the fundamental mode of the pillar , leading to an overall device efficiency of $ \eta=(74\pm4)~\%$ for a single photon emission as pure as $ g^{(2)}(0)=0.0092\pm0.0004$. the combination of large purcell enhancement and resonant pumping conditions allows us to observe a two - photon wave packet overlap up to $ \nu=(88\pm3)~\%$
