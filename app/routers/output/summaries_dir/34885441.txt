recently , a large number of protocols for bidirectional controlled state teleportation ( bcst ) have been proposed using $ n$-qubit entangled states ( $ n\in\{5,6,7\}$ ) as quantum channel . here , we propose a general method of selecting multi - qubit $ ( n>4)$ quantum channels suitable for bcst and show that all the channels used in the existing protocols of bcst can be obtained using the proposed method . further , it is shown that the quantum channels used in the existing protocols of bcst forms only a negligibly small subset of the set of all the quantum channels that can be constructed using the proposed method to implement bcst . it is also noted that all these quantum channels are also suitable for controlled bidirectional remote state preparation ( cbrsp ) . following the same logic , methods for selecting quantum channels for other controlled quantum communication tasks , such as controlled bidirectional joint remote state preparation ( cjbrsp ) and controlled quantum dialogue , are also provided .
