in three dimensions there is a logarithmically divergent contribution to the entanglement entropy which is due to the vertices located at the boundary of the region considered . in this work we find the corresponding universal coefficient for a free dirac field , and extend a previous work in which the scalar case was treated . the problem is equivalent to find the conformal anomaly in three dimensional space where multiplicative boundary conditions for the field are imposed on a plane angular sector . as an intermediate step of the calculation we compute the trace of the green function of a massive dirac field in a two dimensional sphere with boundary conditions imposed on a segment of a great circle .
