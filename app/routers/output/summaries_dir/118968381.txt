quantum nature of black hole horizons has been a subject of recent interest and scrutiny . in particular , a near - horizon quantum violation of the equivalence principle has been proposed as a resolution of the black hole information paradox . such a violation may lead to a modified dispersion relation at high energies , which could become relevant due to the intense gravitational blueshift experienced by ingoing gravitational waves . we investigate the ringdown for a perturbed black hole with such a modified dispersion relation and find that infalling gravitational waves are partially reflected near the horizon . this results in the appearance of late - time $ { \it echoes}$ in the ringdown phase of black hole merger events , with similar properties to those ( arguably ) seen in the advanced ligo observations . current measurements suggest a lorentz - violation scale of $ 10^{13 \pm 2}$ gev for gravitational waves , with comparable dissipation and dispersion . therefore , if confirmed , black hole ringdown echoes probe the microstructure of horizons and thus can test lorentz - violating uv completions , such as in ho$\v{r}$ava - lifshitz gravity .
