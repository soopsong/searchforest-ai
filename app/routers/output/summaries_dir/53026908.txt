we present a novel methodology to enable control of a neuromorphic circuit in close analogy with the physiological neuromodulation of a single neuron . the methodology is general in that it only relies on a parallel interconnection of elementary voltage - controlled current sources . in contrast to controlling a nonlinear circuit through the parameter tuning of a state - space model , our approach is purely input - output . the circuit elements are controlled and interconnected to shape the current - voltage characteristics ( i - v curves ) of the circuit in prescribed timescales . in turn , shaping those i - v curves determines the excitability properties of the circuit . we show that this methodology enables both robust and accurate control of the circuit behavior and resembles the biophysical mechanisms of neuromodulation . as a proof of concept , we simulate a spice model composed of mosfet transconductance amplifiers operating in the weak inversion regime .
