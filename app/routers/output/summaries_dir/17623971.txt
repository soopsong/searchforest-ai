linear differential equations are ubiquitous in science and engineering . quantum computers can simulate quantum systems , which are described by a restricted type of linear differential equations . here we extend quantum simulation algorithms to general inhomogeneous sparse linear differential equations , which describe many classical physical systems . we examine the use of high - order methods to improve the efficiency . these provide scaling close to $ \delta t^2 $ in the evolution time $ \delta t$. as with other algorithms of this type , the solution is encoded in amplitudes of the quantum state , and it is possible to extract global features of the solution .
