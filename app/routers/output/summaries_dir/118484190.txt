we consider the interference of two photons with different colors in the context of a hong - ou - mandel experiment , in which single photons enter each of the input ports of a beam splitter , and exit in the same , albeit undetermined , output port . such interference is possible if one uses an active ( energy - non - conserving ) beam splitter . we find scenarios in which one"red"and one"blue"photon enter the beam splitter , and either two red or two blue photons exit , but never one of each color . we show how the precise form of the active beam - splitter transformation determines in what way the spectral degrees of freedom of the input photons should be related to each other for perfect destructive interference of the different - color components in the output . we discuss two examples of active beam splitters : one is a gedanken experiment involving a moving mirror and the other is a more realistic example involving four - wave mixing in an optical fiber .
