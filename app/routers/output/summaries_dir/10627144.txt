we consider semi - classical black holes and related re - scalings with n massless fields . for a given semi - classical solution of an n = 1 universe , we can find other solution of a large n universe by the re - scaling . after the re - scaling , any curvature quantity takes a sufficiently small value without changing its causal structure . via the re - scaling , we argue that black hole complementarity for semi - classical black holes can not provide a fundamental resolution of the information loss problem , and the violation of black hole complementarity requires sufficiently reasonable amounts of n. such n might be realized from some string inspired models . finally , we claim that any fundamental resolution of the information loss problem should resolve the problem of the singularity .
