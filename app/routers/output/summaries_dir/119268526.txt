groverian and geometric entanglement measures of the n - party pure state are expressed by the ( n-1)-party reduced state density operator directly . this main theorem derives several important consequences . first , if two pure n - qudit states have reduced states of ( n-1)-qudits , which are equivalent under local unitary(lu ) transformations , then they have equal groverian and geometric entanglement measures . second , both measures have an upper bound for pure states . however , this upper bound is reached only for two qubit systems . third , it converts effectively the nonlinear eigenvalue problem for three qubit groverian measure into linear eigenvalue equations . some typical solutions of these linear equations are written explicitly and the features of the general solution are discussed in detail .
