we give a detailed description of the implementation of a molmer - sorensen gate entangling two ca+ ions using a bichromatic laser beam near - resonant with a quadrupole transition . by amplitude pulse shaping and compensation of ac - stark shifts we achieve a fast gate operation without compromising the error rate . subjecting different input states to concatenations of up to 21 individual gate operations reveals bell state fidelities above 0.80 . in principle , the entangling gate does not require ground state cooling of the ions as long as the lamb - dicke criterion is fulfilled . we present the first experimental evidence for this claim and create bell states with a fidelity of 0.974(1 ) for ions in a thermal state of motion with a mean phonon number of < n>=20(2 ) in the mode coupling to the ions ' internal states .
