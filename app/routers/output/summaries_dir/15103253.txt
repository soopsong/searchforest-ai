firstly , the markovian stochastic schr\"odinger equations are presented , together with their connections with the theory of measurements in continuous time . moreover , the stochastic evolution equations are translated into a simulation algorithm , which is illustrated by two concrete examples - the damped harmonic oscillator and a two - level atom with homodyne photodetection . then , we consider how to introduce memory effects in the stochastic schr\"odinger equation via coloured noise . specifically , the approach by using the ornstein - uhlenbeck process is illustrated and a simulation for the non - markovian process proposed . finally , an analytical approximation technique is tested with the help of the stochastic simulation in a model of a dissipative qubit .
