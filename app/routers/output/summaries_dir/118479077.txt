the ability to distribute entanglement over complex quantum networks is an important step towards a quantum internet . recently , there has been significant theoretical effort , mainly focusing on the distribution of bipartite entanglement via a simple quantum network composed only of bipartite quantum channels . there are , however , a number of quantum information processing protocols based on multipartite rather than bipartite entanglement . whereas multipartite entanglement can be distributed by means of a network of bipartite channels , a more natural way is to use a more general network , that is , a quantum broadcast network including quantum broadcast channels . in this work , we present a general frame- work for deriving upper bounds on the rates at which ghz states or multipartite private states can be distributed among a number of different parties over an arbitrary quantum broadcast network . our upper bounds are written in terms of the multipartite squashed entanglement , corresponding to a generalisation of recently derived bounds [ k. azuma et al . , nat . commun . 7 , 13523 ( 2016 ) ] . we also discuss how lower bounds can be obtained by combining a generalisation of an aggregated quantum repeater protocol with graph theoretic concepts .
