blind quantum computation ( bqc ) enables a client with less quantum computational ability to delegate her quantum computation to a server with strong quantum computational power while preserving the client 's privacy . generally , many - qubit entangled states are often used to complete bqc tasks . but for a large - scale entangled state , it is difficult to be described since its hilbert space dimension is increasing exponentially . furthermore , the number of entangled qubits is limited in experiment of existing works . to tackle this problem , in this paper we propose a universal bqc protocol based on measurement with minor resources , where the trap technology is adopted to verify correctness of the server 's measurement outcomes during computation and testing process . in our model there are two participants , a client who prepares initial single - qubit states and a server that performs universal quantum computation . the client is almost classical since she does not require any quantum computational power , quantum memory . to realize the client 's universal bqc , we construct an $ m\times n$ latticed state composed of six - qubit cluster states and eight - qubit cluster states , which needs less qubits than the brickwork state . finally , we analyze and prove the blindness , correctness , universality and verifiability of our proposed bqc protocol .
