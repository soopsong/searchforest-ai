many protocols of quantum information processing use entangled states . hence , separability criteria are of great importance . we propose new separability conditions for a bipartite finite - dimensional system . they are derived by using fine - grained uncertainty relations . fine - grained uncertainty relations can be obtained by consideration of the spectral norms of certain positive matrices . one of possible approaches to separability conditions is connected with upper bounds on the sum of maximal probabilities . separability conditions are often formulated for measurements that have a special structure . for instance , mutually unbiased bases and mutually unbiased measurements can be utilized for such purposes . using resolution of the identity for each subsystem of a bipartite system , we construct some resolution of the identity in the product of hilbert spaces . separability conditions are then formulated in terms of maximal probabilities for a collection of specific outcomes . the presented conditions are compared with some previous formulations . our results are exemplified with entangled states of a two - qutrit system .
