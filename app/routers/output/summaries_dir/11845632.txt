we study a coherent - classical estimation scheme for a class of linear quantum systems , where the estimator is a mixed quantum - classical system that may or may not involve coherent feedback . we show that when the quantum plant or the quantum part of the estimator ( coherent controller ) is an annihilation operator only system , coherent - classical estimation without coherent feedback can provide no improvement over purely - classical estimation . otherwise , coherent - classical estimation without feedback can be better than classical - only estimation for certain homodyne detector angles , although the former is inferior to the latter for the best choice of homodyne detector angle . moreover , we show that coherent - classical estimation with coherent feedback is no better than classical - only estimation , when both the plant and the coherent controller are annihilation operator only systems . otherwise , coherent - classical estimation with coherent feedback can be superior to purely - classical estimation , and in this case , the former is better than the latter for the optimal choice of homodyne detector angle .
