the counter - intuitive properties of quantum mechanics have the potential to revolutionize information processing by enabling the development of efficient algorithms with no known classical counterparts . harnessing this power requires the development of a set of building blocks , one of which is a method to initialize the set of quantum bits ( qubits ) to a known state . additionally , fresh ancillary qubits must be available during the course of computation to achieve fault tolerance . in any physical system used to implement quantum computation , one must therefore be able to selectively and dynamically remove entropy from the part of the system that is to be mapped to qubits . one such method is an ‘ open - system ’ cooling protocol in which a subset of qubits can be brought into contact with an external system of large heat capacity . theoretical efforts have led to an implementation - independent cooling procedure , namely heat - bath algorithmic cooling . these efforts have culminated with the proposal of an optimal algorithm , the partner - pairing algorithm , which was used to compute the physical limits of heat - bath algorithmic cooling . here we report the experimental realization of multi - step cooling of a quantum system via heat - bath algorithmic cooling . the experiment was carried out using nuclear magnetic resonance of a solid - state ensemble three - qubit system . we demonstrate the repeated repolarization of a particular qubit to an effective spin - bath temperature , and alternating logical operations within the three - qubit subspace to ultimately cool a second qubit below this temperature . demonstration of the control necessary for these operations represents an important step forward in the manipulation of solid - state nuclear magnetic resonance qubits .
