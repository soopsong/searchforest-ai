we give an explicit toy qubit transport model for transferring information from the gravitational field of a black hole to the hawking radiation by a continuous unitary transformation of the outgoing radiation and the black hole gravitational field . the model has no firewalls or other drama at the event horizon , and it avoids a counterargument that has been raised for subsystem transfer models as resolutions of the firewall paradox . furthermore , it fits the set of six physical constraints that giddings has proposed for models of black hole evaporation . it does utilize nonlocal qubits for the gravitational field but assumes that the radiation interacts locally with these nonlocal qubits , so in some sense the nonlocality is confined to the gravitational sector . although the qubit model is too crude to be quantitively correct for the detailed spectrum of hawking radiation , it fits qualitatively with what is expected .
