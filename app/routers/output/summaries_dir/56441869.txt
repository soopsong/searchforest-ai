we analyze in details the properties of the conditional state recently obtained by j. wenger , et al . [ phys . rev . lett . { \bf 92 } , 153601 ( 2004 ) ] by means of inconclusive photon subtraction ( ips ) on a squeezed vacuum state $ s(r)\ket{0}$. the ips process can be characterized by two parameters : the ips transmissivity $ \tau$ and the photodetection quantum efficiency $ \eta$. we found that the conditional state approaches the squeezed fock state $ s(r)\ket{1}$ when $ \tau,\eta \to 1 $ , i.e. , in the limit of single - photon subtraction . for non - unit ips transmissivity and efficiency , the conditioned state remains close to the target state , { \em i.e. } shows a high fidelity for a wide range of experimental parameters . the nonclassicality of the conditional state is also investigated and a nonclassicality threshold on the ips parameters is derived .
