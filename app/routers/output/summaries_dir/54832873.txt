we address estimation of temperature for a micromechanical oscillator lying arbitrarily close to its quantum ground state . motivated by recent experiments , we assume that the oscillator is coupled to a probe qubit via jaynes - cummings interaction and that the estimation of its effective temperature is achieved via quantum limited measurements on the qubit . we first consider the ideal unitary evolution in a noiseless environment and then take into account the noise due to non dissipative decoherence . we exploit local quantum estimation theory to assess and optimize the precision of estimation procedures based on the measurement of qubit population , and to compare their performances with the ultimate limit posed by quantum mechanics . in particular , we evaluate the fisher information ( fi ) for population measurement , maximize its value over the possible qubit preparations and interaction times , and compare its behavior with that of the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) . we found that the fi for population measurement is equal to the qfi , i.e. , population measurement is optimal , for a suitable initial preparation of the qubit and a predictable interaction time . the same configuration also corresponds to the maximum of the qfi itself . our results indicate that the achievement of the ultimate bound to precision allowed by quantum mechanics is in the capabilities of the current technology .
