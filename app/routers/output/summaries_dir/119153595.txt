basic properties of the unified entropies are examined . the consideration is mainly restricted to the finite - dimensional quantum case . bounds in terms of ensembles of quantum states are given . both the continuity in fannes ' sense and stability in lesche 's sense are shown for wide ranges of parameters . in particular , uniform estimates are obtained for the quantum r\'{e}nyi entropies . stability properties in the thermodynamic limit are discussed as well . it is shown that the unified entropies enjoy both the subadditivity and triangle inequality for a certain range of parameters . non - decreasing of all the unified entropies under projective measurement is proved .
