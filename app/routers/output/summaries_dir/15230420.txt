we study the light transmission in two - dimensional photonic crystal waveguides with embedded nonlinear defects . first , we derive the effective discrete equations with long - range interaction for describing the waveguide modes , and demonstrate that they provide a highly accurate generalization of the familiar tight - binding models which are employed , e.g. , for the study of the coupled - resonator optical waveguides . using these equations , we investigate the properties of straight waveguides and waveguide bends with embedded nonlinear defects and demonstrate the possibility of the nonlinearity - induced bistable transmission . additionally , we study localized modes in the waveguide bends and ( linear and nonlinear ) transmission of the bent waveguides and emphasize the role of evanescent modes in these phenomena .
