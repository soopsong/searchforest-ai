in this review , we briefly overview recent works on hybrid ( nano ) opto - mechanical systems that contain both mechanical oscillators and diamond nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers . we review two different types of mechanical oscillators . the first one is a clamped mechanical oscillator , such as a cantilever , with a fixed frequency . the second one is an optically trapped nano - diamond with a build - in nitrogen - vacancy center . by coupling mechanical resonators with electron spins , we can use the spins to control the motion of mechanical oscillators . for the first setup , we discuss two different coupling mechanisms which are magnetic coupling and strain induced coupling . we summarize their applications such as cooling the mechanical oscillator , generating entanglements between nv centers , squeezing spin ensembles and et al . for the second setup , we discuss how to generate quantum superposition states with magnetic coupling , and realize matter wave interferometer . we will also review its applications as ultra - sensitive mass spectrometer . finally , we discuss new coupling mechanisms and applications of the field .
