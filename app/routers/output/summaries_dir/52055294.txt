we have recently developed the mass - polariton ( mp ) theory of light to describe the light propagation in transparent bulk materials [ phys . rev . a 95 , 063850 ( 2017 ) ] . the mp theory is general as it is based on the covariance principle and the fundamental conservation laws of nature . therefore , it can be applied also to nonhomogeneous and dispersive materials . in this work , we apply the mp theory of light to describe propagation of light in step - index circular waveguides . we study the eigenmodes of the electric and magnetic fields in a waveguide and use these modes to calculate the optical force density , which is used in the optoelastic continuum dynamics ( ocd ) to simulate the dynamics of medium atoms in the waveguide . we show that the total momentum and angular momentum in the waveguide are carried by a coupled state of the field and the medium . in particular , we focus in the dynamics of atoms , which has not been covered in previous theories that consider only field dynamics in waveguides . we also study the elastic waves generated in the waveguide during the relaxation following from atomic displacements in the waveguide .
