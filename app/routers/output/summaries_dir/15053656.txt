we consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a discrete - time quantum walk ( dtqw ) . we show that a continuous - time quantum walk ( ctqw ) and discrete- and continuous - time random walks can be expressed as dtqws in some limit . at first we generalize our previous study [ phys . rev . a \textbf{81 } , 062129 ( 2010 ) ] on the dtqw with position measurements . we show that the position measurements per each step with probability $ p \sim 1 / n^\beta$ can be evaluated , where $ n$ is the final time and $ 0<\beta<1$. we also give a corresponding continuous - time case . as a consequence , crossovers from the diffusive spreading ( random walk ) to the ballistic spreading ( quantum walk ) can be seen as the parameter $ \beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete- and continuous - time cases of the weak convergence theorems . secondly , we introduce a new class of the dtqw , in which the absolute value of the diagonal parts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the final time $ n$. this is called a final - time - dependent dtqw ( ftd - dtqw ) . the ctqw is obtained in a limit of the ftd - dtqw . we also obtain the weak convergence theorem for the ftd - dtqw which shows a variety of spreading properties . finally , we consider the ftd - dtqw with periodic position measurements . this weak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently long - time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous - time quantum and random walks .
