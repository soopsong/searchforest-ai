we introduce the characterization of a class of quantum pagerank algorithms in a scenario in which some kind of quantum network is realizable out of the current classical internet web , but no quantum computer is yet available . this class represents a quantization of the pagerank protocol currently employed to list web pages according to their importance . we have found an instance of this class of quantum protocols that outperforms its classical counterpart and may break the classical hierarchy of web pages depending on the topology of the web .
