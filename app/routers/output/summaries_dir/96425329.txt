we theoretically study complementarity between micro - micro and micro - macro entanglement in a bose - einstein condensate with two rydberg impurities . we investigate quantum dynamics of micro - micro and micro - macro entanglement in the micro - macro system . it is found that strong micro - macro entanglement between rydberg impurities and the bec can be generated by the use of initial micro - micro entanglement between two rydberg impurities , which acts as the seed entanglement to create micro - macro entanglement . we demonstrate a curious complementarity relation between micro - micro and micro - macro entanglement , and find that the complementarity property can be sustained to some extend even though in the presence of the bec decoherence .
