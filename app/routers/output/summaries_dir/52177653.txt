due to little consideration in the hardware constraints , e.g. , limited connections between physical qubits to enable two - qubit gates , most quantum algorithms can not be directly executed on the noisy intermediate - scale quantum ( nisq ) devices . dynamically remapping logical qubits to physical qubits in the compiler is needed to enable the two - qubit gates in the algorithm , which introduces additional operations and inevitably reduces the fidelity of the algorithm . previous solutions in finding such remapping suffer from high complexity , poor initial mapping quality , and limited flexibility and controllability . to address these drawbacks mentioned above , this paper proposes a swap - based bidirectional heuristic search algorithm sabre , which is applicable to nisq devices with arbitrary connections between qubits . by optimizing every search attempt , globally optimizing the initial mapping using a novel reverse traversal technique , introducing the decay effect to enable the trade - off between the depth and the number of gates of the entire algorithm , sabre outperforms the best known algorithm with exponential speedup and comparable or better results on various benchmarks .
