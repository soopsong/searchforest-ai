quantum key distribution is on the verge of real world applications , where perfectly secure information can be distributed among multiple parties . several quantum cryptographic protocols have been theoretically proposed and independently realized in different experimental conditions . here , we develop an experimental platform based on high - dimensional orbital angular momentum states of single photons that enables implementation of multiple quantum key distribution protocols with a single experimental apparatus . our versatile approach allows us to experimentally survey different classes of quantum key distribution techniques , such as the 1984 bennett \&brassard ( bb84 ) , tomographic protocols including the six - state and the singapore protocol , and to investigate , for the first time , a recently introduced differential phase shift ( chau15 ) protocol using twisted photons . this enables us to experimentally compare the performance of these techniques and discuss their benefits and deficiencies in terms of noise tolerance in different dimensions .
