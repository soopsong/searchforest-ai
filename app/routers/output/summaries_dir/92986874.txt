the coined quantum walk is a discretization of the dirac equation of relativistic quantum mechanics , and it is the basis of many quantum algorithms . we investigate how it searches the complete bipartite graph of $ n$ vertices for one of $ k$ marked vertices with different initial states . we prove intriguing dependence on the number of marked and unmarked vertices in each partite set . for example , when the graph is irregular and the initial state is the typical uniform superposition over the vertices , then the success probability can vary greatly from one timestep to the next , even alternating between 0 and 1 , so the precise time at which measurement occurs is crucial . when the initial state is a uniform superposition over the edges , however , the success probability evolves smoothly . as another example , if the complete bipartite graph is regular , then the two initial states are equivalent . then if two marked vertices are in the same partite set , the success probability reaches 1/2 , but if they are in different partite sets , it instead reaches $ 1$. this differs from the complete graph , which is the quantum walk formulation of grover 's algorithm , where the success probability with two marked vertices is 8/9 . this reveals a contrast to the continuous - time quantum walk , whose evolution is governed by schr\"odinger 's equation , which asymptotically searches the regular complete bipartite graph with any arrangement of marked vertices in the same manner as the complete graph .
