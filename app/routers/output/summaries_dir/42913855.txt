we investigate experimentally the energy distribution of a single rubidium atom trapped in a strongly focused dipole trap under various cooling regimes . using two different methods to measure the mean energy of the atom , we show that the energy distribution of the radiatively cooled atom is close to thermal . we then demonstrate how to reduce the energy of the single atom , first by adiabatic cooling , and then by truncating the boltzmann distribution of the single atom . this provides a non - deterministic way to prepare atoms at low microkelvin temperatures , close to the ground state of the trapping potential .
