negativity is an entanglement monotone frequently used to quantify entanglement in bipartite states . because negativity is a non - analytic function of a density matrix , existing methods used in the physics literature are insufficient to compute its derivatives . to this end we develop techniques in the calculus of complex , patterned matrices and use them to conduct a perturbative analysis of negativity in terms of arbitrary variations of the density operator . the result is an easy - to - implement expansion that can be carried out to all orders . on the way we provide convenient representations of the partial transposition map appearing in the definition of negativity . our methods are well - suited to study the growth and decay of entanglement in a wide range of physical systems , including the generic linear growth of entanglement in many - body systems , and have broad relevance to many functions of quantum states and observables .
