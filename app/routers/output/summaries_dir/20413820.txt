we report a 65mhz - bandwidth triangular - shaped optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) for squeezed vacuum generation at 860 nm . the triangle structure of our opo enables the round - trip length to reach 45 mm as a ring cavity , which provides a counter circulating optical path available for introducing a probe beam or generating another squeezed vacuum . hence our opo is suitable for the applications in high - speed quantum information processing where two or more squeezed vacua form a complicated interferometer , like continuous - variable quantum teleportation . with a homemade , broadband and low - loss homodyne detector , a direct measurement shows 8.4db of squeezing at 3mhz and also 2.4db of squeezing at 100mhz .
