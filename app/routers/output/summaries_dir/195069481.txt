the establishment of a world - wide quantum communication network relies on the synergistic integration of satellite - based links and fiber - based networks . the first are helpful for long - distance communication , as the photon losses introduced by the optical fibers are too detrimental for lengths greater than about 200 km . this work aims at giving , on the one hand , a comprehensive and fundamental model for the losses suffered by the quantum signals during the propagation along an atmospheric free - space link . on the other hand , a performance analysis of different quantum key distribution ( qkd ) implementations is performed , including finite - key effects , focusing on different interesting practical scenarios . the specific approach that we chose allows to precisely model the contribution due to different weather conditions , paving the way towards more accurate feasibility studies of satellite - based qkd missions .
