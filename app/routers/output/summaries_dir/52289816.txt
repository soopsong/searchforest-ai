what is the energy cost of extracting entanglement from complex quantum systems ? in other words , given a state of a quantum system , how much energy does it cost to extract m epr pairs ? this is an important question , particularly for quantum field theories where the vacuum is generally highly entangled . here we build a theory to understand the energy cost of entanglement extraction . first , we apply it to a toy model , and then we define the entanglement temperature , which relates the energy cost to the amount of extracted entanglement . next , we give a physical argument to find the energy cost of entanglement extraction in some condensed matter and quantum field systems . the energy cost for those quantum field theories depends on the spatial dimension , and in one dimension , for example , it grows exponentially with the number of epr pairs extracted . next , we outline some approaches for bounding the energy cost of extracting entanglement in general quantum systems . finally , we look at the antiferromagnetic heisenberg and transverse field ising models numerically to calculate the entanglement temperature using matrix product states .
