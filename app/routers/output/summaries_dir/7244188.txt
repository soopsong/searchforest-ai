we consider quantum mds ( qmds ) codes for quantum systems of dimension $ q$ with lengths up to $ q^2 + 2 $ and minimum distances up to $ q+1$. we show how starting from qmds codes of length $ q^2 + 1 $ based on cyclic and constacyclic codes , new qmds codes can be obtained by shortening . we provide numerical evidence for our conjecture that almost all admissible lengths , from a lower bound $ n_0(q , d)$ on , are achievable by shortening . some additional codes that fill gaps in the list of achievable lengths are presented as well along with a construction of a family of qmds codes of length $ q^2 + 2 $ , where $ q=2^m$ , that appears to be new .
