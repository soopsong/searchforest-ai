in entanglement - based quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , the generation and detection of multi - photon modes leads to a trade - off between entanglement visibility and two - fold coincidence events when maximizing the secure key rate ( skr ) . we produce a predictive model for the optimal two - fold coincidence probability per coincidence window given the channel efficiency and detector dark count rate of a given system . this model is experimentally validated and used in simulations for qkd with satellites as well as optical fibers .
