we present the design , fabrication , and characterization of a planar silicon photonic crystal cavity in which large position - squared optomechanical coupling is realized . the device consists of a double - slotted photonic crystal structure in which motion of a central beam mode couples to two high - q optical modes localized around each slot . electrostatic tuning of the structure is used to controllably hybridize the optical modes into supermodes which couple in a quadratic fashion to the motion of the beam . from independent measurements of the anti - crossing of the optical modes and of the optical spring effect , the position - squared vacuum coupling rate is measured to be as large as 245 hz to the fundamental in - plane mechanical resonance of the structure at 8.7mhz , which in displacement units corresponds to a coupling coefficient of 1 thz / nm$^2$. this level of position - squared coupling is approximately five orders of magnitude larger than in conventional fabry - perot cavity systems .
