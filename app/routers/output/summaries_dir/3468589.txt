how useful can machine learning be in a quantum laboratory ? here we raise the question of the potential of intelligent machines in the context of scientific research . a major motivation for the present work is the unknown reachability of various entanglement classes in quantum experiments . we investigate this question by using the projective simulation model , a physics - oriented approach to artificial intelligence . in our approach , the projective simulation system is challenged to design complex photonic quantum experiments that produce high - dimensional entangled multiphoton states , which are of high interest in modern quantum experiments . the artificial intelligence system learns to create a variety of entangled states , and improves the efficiency of their realization . in the process , the system autonomously ( re)discovers experimental techniques which are only now becoming standard in modern quantum optical experiments - a trait which was not explicitly demanded from the system but emerged through the process of learning . such features highlight the possibility that machines could have a significantly more creative role in future research .
