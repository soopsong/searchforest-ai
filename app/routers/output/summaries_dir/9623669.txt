we propose the use of nanostructured photonic nanocavities made of second - order nonlinear materials as prospective passive devices to generate strongly sub - poissonian light via single - photon blockade of an input coherent field . the simplest scheme is based on the requirement that the nanocavity be doubly resonant , i.e. possess cavity modes with good spatial overlap at both the fundamental and second - harmonic frequencies . we discuss feasibility of this scheme with state - of - the art nanofabrication technology , and the possibility to use it as a passive single - photon source on - demand .
