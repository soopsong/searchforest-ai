reservoir engineering is the term used in quantum control and information technologies to describe manipulating the environment within which an open quantum system operates . reservoir engineering is essential in applications where storing quantum information is required . from the control theory perspective , a quantum system is capable of storing quantum information if it possesses a so - called decoherence free subsystem ( dfs ) . this paper explores pole placement techniques to facilitate synthesis of decoherence free subsystems via coherent quantum feedback control . we discuss limitations of the conventional ` open loop ' approach and propose a constructive feedback design methodology for decoherence free subsystem engineering . it captures a quite general dynamic coherent feedback structure which allows systems with decoherence free modes to be synthesized from components which do not have such modes .
