we derive sublinear - time quantum algorithms for computing the nash equilibrium of two - player zero - sum games , based on efficient gibbs sampling methods . we are able to achieve speed - ups for both dense and sparse payoff matrices at the cost of a mildly increased dependence on the additive error compared to classical algorithms . in particular we can find $ \varepsilon$-approximate nash equilibrium strategies in complexity $ \tilde{o}(\sqrt{n+m}/\varepsilon^3)$ and $ \tilde{o}(\sqrt{s}/\varepsilon^{3.5})$ respectively , where $ n\times m$ is the size of the matrix describing the game and $ s$ is its sparsity . our algorithms use the lp formulation of the problem and apply techniques developed in recent works on quantum sdp - solvers . we also show how to reduce general lp - solving to zero - sum games , resulting in quantum lp - solvers that have complexities $ \tilde{o}(\sqrt{n+m}\gamma^3)$ and $ \tilde{o}(\sqrt{s}\gamma^{3.5})$ for the dense and sparse access models respectively , where $ \gamma$ is the relevant"scale - invariant"precision parameter
