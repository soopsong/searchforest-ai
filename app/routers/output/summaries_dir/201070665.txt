established heat engines in quantum regime can be modeled with various quantum systems as working substances . for example , in the non - relativistic case , we can model the heat engine using infinite potential well as a working substance to evaluate the efficiency and work done of the engine . here , we propose quantum heat engine with a relativistic particle confined in the one - dimensional potential well as working substance . the cycle comprises of two isothermal processes and two potential well processes of equal width , which forms the quantum counterpart of the known isochoric process in classical nature . for a concrete interpretation about the relation between the quantum observables with the physically measurable parameters ( like the efficiency and work done ) , we develop a link between the thermodynamic variables and the uncertainty relation . we have used this model to explore the work extraction and the efficiency of the heat engine for a relativistic case from the standpoint of uncertainty relation , where the incompatible observables are the position and the momentum operators . we are able to determine the bounds ( the upper and the lower bounds ) of the efficiency of the heat engine through the thermal uncertainty relation .
