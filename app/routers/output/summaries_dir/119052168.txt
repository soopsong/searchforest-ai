there are two complementary approaches to realizing quantum information so that it is protected from a given set of error operators . both involve encoding information by means of subsystems . one is initialization - based error protection , which involves a quantum operation that is applied before error events occur . the other is operator quantum error correction , which uses a recovery operation applied after the errors . together , the two approaches make it clear how quantum information can be stored at all stages of a process involving alternating error and quantum operations . in particular , there is always a subsystem that faithfully represents the desired quantum information . we give a definition of faithful realization of quantum information and show that it always involves subsystems . this justifies the"subsystems principle"for realizing quantum information . in the presence of errors , one can make use of noiseless , ( initialization ) protectable , or error - correcting subsystems . we give an explicit algorithm for finding optimal noiseless subsystems . finding optimal protectable or error - correcting subsystems is in general difficult . verifying that a subsystem is error - correcting involves only linear algebra . we discuss the verification problem for protectable subsystems and reduce it to a simpler version of the problem of finding error - detecting codes .
