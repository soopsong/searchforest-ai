in recent years , a close connection between the description of open quantum systems , the input - output formalism of quantum optics , and continuous matrix product states in quantum field theory has been established . so far , however , this connection has not been extended to the condensed - matter context . in this work , we substantially develop further and apply a machinery of continuous matrix product states ( cmps ) to perform tomography of transport experiments . we first present an extension of the tomographic possibilities of cmps by showing that reconstruction schemes do not need to be based on low - order correlation functions only , but also on low - order counting probabilities . we show that fermionic quantum transport settings can be formulated within the cmps framework . this allows us to present a reconstruction scheme based on the measurement of low - order correlation functions that provides access to quantities that are not directly measurable with present technology . emblematic examples are high - order correlations functions and waiting times distributions ( wtd ) . the latter are of particular interest since they offer insights into short - time scale physics . we demonstrate the functioning of the method with actual data , opening up the way to accessing wtd within the quantum regime .
