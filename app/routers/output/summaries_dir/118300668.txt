we study the entanglement and renyi entropies of two disjoint intervals in minimal models of conformal field theory . we use the conformal block expansion and fusion rules of twist fields to define a systematic expansion in the elliptic parameter of the trace of the n - th power of the reduced density matrix . keeping only the first few terms we obtain an approximate expression that is easily analytically continued to n->1 , leading to an approximate formula for the entanglement entropy . these predictions are checked against some known exact results as well as against existing numerical data .
