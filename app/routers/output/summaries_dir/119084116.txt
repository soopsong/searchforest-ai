we study emerging notions of quantum correlations in compound systems . based on different definitions of quantumness in individual subsystems , we investigate how they extend to the joint description of a composite system . especially , we study the bipartite case and the connection of two typically applied and distinctively different concepts of nonclassicality in quantum optics and quantum information . our investigation includes the representation of correlated states in terms of quasiprobability matrices , a comparative study of joint and conditional quantum correlations , and an entanglement characterization . it is , for example , shown that our composition approach always includes entanglement as one form of quantum correlations . yet , other forms of quantum correlations can also occur without entanglement . finally , we give an outlook towards multimode systems and temporal correlations .
