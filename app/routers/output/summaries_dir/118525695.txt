we present a nonlocal entanglement concentration scheme for reconstructing some maximally entangled multipartite states from partially entangled ones by exploiting cross - kerr nonlinearities to distinguish the parity of two polarization photons . compared with the entanglement concentration schemes based on two - particle collective unitary evolution , this scheme does not require the parties to know accurately information about the partially entangled states -- i.e . , their coefficients . moreover , it does not require the parties to possess sophisticated single - photon detectors , which makes this protocol feasible with present techniques . by iteration of entanglement concentration processes , this scheme has a higher efficiency and yield than those with linear optical elements . all these advantages make this scheme more efficient and more convenient than others in practical applications .
