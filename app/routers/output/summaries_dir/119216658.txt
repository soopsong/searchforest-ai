quantum theory is known to be nonlocal in the sense that separated parties can perform measurements on a shared quantum state to obtain correlated probability distributions , which can not be achieved if the parties share only classical randomness . here we find that the set of distributions compatible with sharing quantum states subject to some sufficiently restricted dimension is neither convex nor a superset of the classical distributions . we examine the relationship between quantum distributions associated with a dimensional constraint and classical distributions associated with limited shared randomness . we prove that quantum correlations are convex for certain finite dimension in certain bell scenarios and that they sometimes offer a dimensional advantage in realizing local distributions . we also consider if there exist bell scenarios where the set of quantum correlations is never convex with finite dimensionality .
