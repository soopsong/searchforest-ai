when a composite quantum state interacts with its surroundings , both quantum coherence of individual particles and quantum entanglement will decay . we have shown that under vacuum noise , i.e. , during spontaneous emission , two - qubit entanglement may terminate abruptly in a finite time [ t. yu and j. h. eberly , \prl { 93 } , 140404 ( 2004 ) ] , a phenomenon termed entanglement sudden death ( esd ) . an open issue is the behavior of mixed - state entanglement under the influence of classical noise . in this paper we investigate entanglement sudden death as it arises from the influence of classical phase noise on two qubits that are initially entangled but have no further mutual interaction .
