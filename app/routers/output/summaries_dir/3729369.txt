we introduce a generalized theory of decoherence - free subspaces and subsystems ( dfss ) , which do not require accurate initialization . we derive a new set of conditions for the existence of dfss within this generalized framework . by relaxing the initialization requirement we show that a dfs can tolerate arbitrarily large preparation errors . this has potentially significant implications for experiments involving dfss , in particular for the experimental implementation , over dfss , of the large class of quantum algorithms which can function with arbitrary input states .
