in this work we investigate the effectiveness of continuous - variable ( cv ) entangled states , transferred through high - loss atmospheric channels , as a means of viable quantum key distribution ( qkd ) between terrestrial stations and low - earth orbit ( leo ) satellites . in particular , we investigate the role played by the gaussian cv states as compared to non - gaussian states . we find that beam - wandering induced atmospheric losses lead to qkd performance levels that are in general quite different from those found in fixed - attenuation channels . for example , circumstances can be found where no qkd is viable at some fixed loss in fiber but is viable at the same mean loss in fading channels . we also find that , in some circumstances , the qkd relative performance of gaussian and non - gaussian states can in atmospheric channels be the reverse of that found in fixed - attenuation channels . these findings show that the nature of the atmospheric channel can have a large impact on the qkd performance . our results should prove useful for emerging global quantum communications that use leo satellites as communication relays .
