we investigate the quantum parameter estimation in circuit quantum electrodynamics via dispersive measurement . based on the metropolis hastings ( mh ) algorithm and the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) integration , a new algorithm is proposed to calculate the fisher information by the stochastic master equation for unknown parameter estimation . here , the fisher information is expressed in the form of log - likehood functions and further approximated by the mcmc integration . numerical results demonstrate that the single evolution of the fisher information can probably approach the quantum fisher information . the same phenomenon is observed in the ensemble evolution in the short time interval . these results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm .
