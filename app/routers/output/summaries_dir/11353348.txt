we present an integrated optomechanical and electromechanical nanocavity , in which a common mechanical degree of freedom is coupled to an ultrahigh - q photonic crystal defect cavity and an electrical circuit . the sys- tem allows for wide - range , fast electrical tuning of the optical nanocavity resonances , and for electrical control of optical radiation pressure back - action effects such as mechanical amplification ( phonon lasing ) , cooling , and stiffening . these sort of integrated devices offer a new means to efficiently interconvert weak microwave and optical signals , and are expected to pave the way for a new class of micro - sensors utilizing optomechanical back - action for thermal noise reduction and low - noise optical read - out .
