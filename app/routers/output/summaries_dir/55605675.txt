there is currently fundamental and technological interest in measuring and manipulating nanoscale magnets , particularly in the quantum coherent regime . to observe the dynamics of such systems one requires a magnetometer with not only exceptional sensitivity but also high gain , wide bandwidth and low backaction . we demonstrate a dispersive magnetometer consisting of a two - junction squid in parallel with an integrated , lumped - element capacitor . input flux signals are encoded as a phase modulation of the microwave drive tone applied to the magnetometer , resulting in a single quadrature voltage signal . for strong drive power , the nonlinearity of the resonator results in quantum limited , phase sensitive parametric amplification of this signal , which improves flux sensitvity at the expense of bandwidth . \ depending on the drive parameters , the device performance ranges from an effective flux noise of 0.29\textbf{}$\mu\phi_{0}$hz$^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ and 20 mhz of signal bandwidth to a noise of 0.14 $ \mu\phi_{0}$hz$^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ and a bandwidth of 0.6 mhz . these results are in excellent agreement with our theoretical model .
