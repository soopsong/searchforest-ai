estimation of quantum states and measurements is crucial for the implementation of quantum information protocols . the standard method for each is quantum tomography . however , quantum tomography suffers from systematic errors caused by imperfect knowledge of the system . we present a procedure to simultaneously characterize quantum states and measurements that mitigates systematic errors by use of a single high - fidelity state preparation and a limited set of high - fidelity unitary operations . such states and operations are typical of many state - of - the - art systems . for this situation we design a set of experiments and an optimization algorithm that alternates between maximizing the likelihood with respect to the states and measurements to produce estimates of each . in some cases , the procedure does not enable unique estimation of the states . for these cases , we show how one may identify a set of density matrices compatible with the measurements and use a semi - definite program to place bounds on the state 's expectation values . we demonstrate the procedure on data from a simulated experiment with two trapped ions .
