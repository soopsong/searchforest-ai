we apply innovative mathematical tools coming from optimal control theory to improve theoretical and experimental techniques in magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) . this approach allows us to explore and to experimentally reach the physical limits of the corresponding spin dynamics in the presence of typical experimental imperfections and limitations . we study in this paper two important goals , namely the optimization of image contrast and the maximization of the signal to noise per unit time . we anticipate that the proposed techniques will find practical applications in medical imaging in a near future to help the medical diagnosis .
