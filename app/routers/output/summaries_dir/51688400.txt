direct uv - written waveguides are fabricated in silica - on - silicon with birefringence of $ ( 4.9 \pm 0.2 ) \times 10^{-4}$ , much greater than previously reported in this platform . we show that these waveguides are suitable for the generation of heralded single photons at telecommunication wavelengths by spontaneous four - wave mixing . a pulsed pump field at 1060 nm generates pairs of photons in highly detuned , spectrally uncorrelated modes near 1550 nm and 800 nm . waveguide - to - fiber coupling efficiencies of 78 - 91 % are achieved for all fields . waveguide birefringence is controlled through dopant concentration of $ \mathrm{gecl_4}$ and $ \mathrm{bcl_3}$ using the flame hydrolysis deposition process . the technology provides a route towards the scalability of silica - on - silicon integrated components for photonic quantum experiments .
