for some cavity - quantum - electrodynamics systems , such as a single electron spin coupled to a passive cavity , it is challenging to reach the strong - coupling regime . in such a weak - coupling regime , the conventional dispersive readout technique can not be used to resolve the quantum states of the spin . here we propose an improved dispersive readout method to measure the quantum states of a weakly coupled qubit by harnessing either one or two auxiliary cavities linearly coupled to the passive cavity containing the qubit . with appropriate parameters in both cases , the system excluding the qubit can exhibit a parity - time - symmetric phase transition at the exceptional point ( ep ) . because the ep can amplify the perturbation induced by the qubit and the parity - time symmetry can narrow the linewidths of the peaks in the transmission spectrum of the passive cavity , we can measure the quantum states of the weakly coupled qubit via this transmission spectrum . owing to the weak coupling between the qubit and the passive cavity , the backaction due to the measurement of the qubit can also be reduced in comparison with the conventional dispersive readout technique in the strong - coupling regime .
