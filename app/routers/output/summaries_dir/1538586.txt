a strong converse theorem for channel capacity establishes that the error probability in any communication scheme for a given channel necessarily tends to one if the rate of communication exceeds the channel 's capacity . establishing such a theorem for the quantum capacity of degradable channels has been an elusive task , with the strongest progress so far being a so - called"pretty strong converse " . in this work , morgan and winter proved that the quantum error of any quantum communication scheme for a given degradable channel converges to a value larger than $ 1/\sqrt{2}$ in the limit of many channel uses if the quantum rate of communication exceeds the channel 's quantum capacity . the present paper establishes a theorem that is a counterpart to this"pretty strong converse " . we prove that the large fraction of codes having a rate exceeding the erasure channel 's quantum capacity have a quantum error tending to one in the limit of many channel uses . thus , our work adds to the body of evidence that a fully strong converse theorem should hold for the quantum capacity of the erasure channel . as a side result , we prove that the classical capacity of the quantum erasure channel obeys the strong converse property .
