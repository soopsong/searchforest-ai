the focus of this work is on the design of raptor codes for continuous variable quantum key distribution ( cv - qkd ) systems . we design a highly efficient raptor code for very low signal to noise ratios ( snrs ) , which enables cv - qkd systems to operate over long distances with a significantly higher secret key rate compared to conventional fixed rate codes . the degree distribution design of raptor codes in the low snr regime is formulated as a linear program , where a set of optimized degree distributions are also obtained through linear programming . simulation results show that the designed code achieves efficiencies higher than 94\% for snrs as low as -20 db and -30 db . we further propose a new error reconciliation protocol for cv - qkd systems by using raptor codes and show that it can achieve higher secret key rates over long distances compared to existing protocols .
