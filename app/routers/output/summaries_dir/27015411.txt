a key ingredient in emerging quantum - enhanced technologies is the ability to coherently manipulate and detect superpositions of basis states . in integrated optics implementations , transverse spatial modes supported by multimode structures offer an attractive carrier of quantum superpositions . here we propose an integrated dynamic mode converter based on the electro - optic effect in nonlinear channel waveguides for deterministic transformations between mutually non - orthogonal bases of spatial modes . we theoretically show its capability to demonstrate a violation of a bell - type clauser - horne - shimony - holt inequality by measuring spatially mode - entangled photon pairs generated by an integrated photon pair source . the proposed configuration , numerically studied for the potassium titanyl phosphate ( ktp ) material , can be easily implemented using standard integrated optical fabrication technology .
