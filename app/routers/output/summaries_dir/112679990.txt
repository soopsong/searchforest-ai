linear optical quantum computing ( loqc ) seems attractively simple : information is borne entirely by light and processed by components such as beam splitters , phase shifters and detectors . however this very simplicity leads to limitations , such as the lack of deterministic entangling operations , which are compensated for by using substantial hardware overheads . here we quantify the resource costs for full scale loqc by proposing a specific protocol based on the surface code . with the caveat that our protocol can be further optimised , we report that the required number of physical components is at least five orders of magnitude greater than in comparable matter - based systems . moreover the resource requirements grow higher if the per - component photon loss rate is worse than one in a thousand , or the per - component noise rate is worse than $ 10^{-5}$. we identify the performance of switches in the network as the single most influential factor influencing resource scaling .
