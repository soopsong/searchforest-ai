this article provides an elementary introduction to gaussian channels and their capacities . we review results on the classical , quantum , and entanglement assisted capacities and discuss related entropic quantities as well as additivity issues . some of the known results are extended . in particular , it is shown that the quantum conditional entropy is maximized by gaussian states and that some implications for additivity problems can be extended to the gaussian setting .
