a formalism for studying spontaneous decay of an excited two - level atom in the presence of dispersing and absorbing dielectric bodies is developed . an integral equation , which is suitable for numerical solution , is derived for the atomic upper - state - probability amplitude . the emission pattern and the power spectrum of the emitted light are expressed in terms of the green tensor of the dielectric - matter formation including absorption and dispersion . the theory is applied to the spontaneous decay of an excited atom at the center of a three - layered spherical cavity , with the cavity wall being modeled by a band - gap dielectric of lorentz type . both weak coupling and strong coupling are studied , the latter with special emphasis on the cases where the atomic transition is ( i ) in the normal - dispersion zone near the medium resonance and ( ii ) in the anomalous - dispersion zone associated with the band gap . in a single - resonance approximation , conditions of the appearance of rabi oscillations and closed solutions to the evolution of the atomic state population are derived , which are in good agreement with the exact numerical results .
