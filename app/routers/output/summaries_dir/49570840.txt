recently , the development of quantum chips has made great progress-- the number of qubits is increasing and the fidelity is getting higher . however , qubits of these chips are not always fully connected , which sets additional barriers for implementing quantum algorithms and programming quantum programs . in this paper , we introduce a general circuit optimizing scheme , which can efficiently adjust and optimize quantum circuits according to arbitrary given qubits ' layout by adding additional quantum gates , exchanging qubits and merging single - qubit gates . compared with the optimizing algorithm of ibm 's qiskit , the quantum gates consumed by our scheme is 74.7 % , and the execution time is only 12.9 % on average .
