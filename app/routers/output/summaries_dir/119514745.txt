silicon ring resonators are used as photon pair sources by taking advantage of silicon 's large third order nonlinearity with a process known as spontaneous four wave mixing . these sources are capable of producing pairs of indistinguishable photons but typically suffer from an effective $ 50\%$ loss . by slightly decoupling the input waveguide from the ring , the drop port coincidence ratio can be significantly increased with the trade - off being that the pump is less efficiently coupled into the ring . ring resonators with this design have been demonstrated having coincidence ratios of $ \sim 96\%$ but requiring a factor of $ \sim 10 $ increase in the pump power . through the modification of the coupling design that relies on additional spectral dependence , it is possible to achieve similar coincidence ratios without the increased pumping requirement . this can be achieved by coupling the input waveguide to the ring multiple times , thus creating a mach - zehnder interferometer . this coupler design can be used on both sides of the ring resonator so that resonances supported by one of the couplers are suppressed by the other . this is the ideal configuration for a photon - pair source as it can only support the pump photons at the input side while only allowing the generated photons to leave through the output side . recently , this device has been realized with preliminary results exhibiting the desired spectral dependence and with a coincidence ratio as high as $ \sim 97\%$ while allowing the pump to be nearly critically coupled to the ring . the demonstrated near unity coincidence ratio infers a near maximal heralding efficiency from the fabricated device . this device has the potential to greatly improve the scalability and performance of quantum computing and communication systems .
