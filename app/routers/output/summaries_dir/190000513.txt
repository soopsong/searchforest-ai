we analyze the dynamics of multiparticle discrete - time quantum walk on the two - dimensional lattice , with an interaction inspired on a classical model for gas collision , called hpp model . in this classical model , the direction of motion changes only when the particles collide head - on , preserving momentum and energy . in our quantum model , the dynamics is driven by the usual quantum - walk evolution operator if the particles are on different nodes , and is driven by the hpp rules if the particles are in the same node , linearly extended for superpositions . using this new form of evolution operator , we numerically analyze three physical quantities for the two - walker case : the probability distribution of the position of one walker , the standard deviation of the position of one walker , and the entanglement between the walkers as a function of the number of steps . the numerical analysis implies that the entanglement between the walkers as a function of the number of steps initially increases and quickly tends to a constant value , which depends on the initial condition . we compare the results obtained using the hpp interaction with the equivalent ones using the phase interaction , which is based on an evolution operator that inverts the sign of the coin operator if the walkers are in the same position .
