we propose a nonlocal entanglement concentration protocol ( ecp ) for $ n$-photon systems in a partially entangled w state , resorting to some ancillary single photons and the parity - check measurement based on cross - kerr nonlinearity . one party in quantum communication first performs a parity - check measurement on her photon in an $ n$-photon system and an ancillary photon , and then she picks up the even - parity instance for obtaining the standard w state . when she obtains an odd - parity instance , the system is in a less - entanglement state and it is the resource in the next round of entanglement concentration . by iterating the entanglement concentration process several times , the present ecp has the total success probability approaching to the limit in theory . the present ecp has the advantage of a high success probability . moreover , the present ecp requires only the $ n$-photon system itself and some ancillary single photons , not two copies of the systems , which decreases the difficulty of its implementation largely in experiment . it maybe have good applications in quantum communication in future .
