this paper focuses on changing fock matrix elements of two - mode squeezed vacuum state ( tmsvs ) by employing three quantum operations in one - sided lossy channel . these three quantum operations include one - photon replacement ( opr ) , one - photon substraction ( ops ) and one - photon addition ( opa ) . indeed , three conditional quantum states have been generated from the original tmsvs . using the characteristic function ( cf ) representation of quantum density operator , we derive the analytical expressions of their fock matrix elements , which are dependent on the interaction parameters , including the squeezing parameter of the input tmsvs , the loss factor and the transmissivity of the variable beam splitter . for convenience of discussion , we only give the fock matrices in the subspace span { |00>,|01>,|10>,|02>,|11>,|20 > } for these two - mode states . obviously , the tmsvs only has the populations in |00 > and |11 > in such subspace . by comparing the generated states with the tmsvs , we find that : ( 1 ) the generated state after opr will remain the populations in |00 > and |11 > , and add the populations in |10 > and |20 > ; ( 2 ) the generated state after ops will lost the populations in |00 > and |11 > , but add the populations in |10 > and |20 > ; ( 3 ) the generated state after opa will remain the population only in |11 > and add the population in |01 > .
