a finite set of quantum observables ( positive operator valued measures ) is called compatible if these observables are marginals of a some observable , called a joint observable of them . for a given set of compatible observables , their joint observable is in general not unique and it is desirable to take a minimal joint observable in the post - processing order since a less informative observable disturbs less the system . we address the question of the minimality of finite - outcome joint observables and prove that any joint observable is lower bounded by a minimal joint observable in the post - processing order . we also give characterizations of the minimality of a joint observable that can be checked by finite - step algorithms and apply them to the case of non - commuting dichotomic qubit observables .
