we present detailed derivations , various improvements and application to concrete experimental data of spin squeezing inequalities formulated recently by some of us [ phys . rev . lett . { \bf 95 } , 120502 ( 2005 ) ] . these inequalities generalize the concept of the spin squeezing parameter , and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for genuine 2- , or 3- qubit entanglement for symmetric states , and sufficient entanglement condition for general $ n$-qubit states . we apply our method to theoretical study of dicke states , and , in particular , to $ w$-states of $ n$ qubits . then , we analyze the recently experimentally generated 7- and 8-ion $ w$-states [ nature { \bf 438 } , 643 ( 2005 ) ] . we also present some novel details concerning this experiment . finally , we improve criteria for detection of genuine tripartite entanglement based on entanglement witnesses .
