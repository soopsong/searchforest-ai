optomechanical cooling is a prerequisite for many exotic applications promised by modern quantum technology and it is crucial to achieve it in short times , in order to minimize the undesirable effects of the environment . we formulate cavity optomechanical cooling as a minimum - time optimal control problem on anti - de sitter space of appropriate dimension and use the legendre pseudospectral optimization method to find the minimum time and the corresponding optimal control , for various values of the maximum coupling rate between the cavity field and the mechanical resonator . the present framework can also be applied to create optomechanical entanglement in minimum time and to improve the efficiency of an optomechanical quantum heat engine .
