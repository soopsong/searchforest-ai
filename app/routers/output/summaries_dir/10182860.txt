in this work , we investigate the controlled teleportation protocol using optical qubits within the single - rail logic . the protocol makes use of an entangled tripartite state shared by the controller and two further parties ( users ) who will perform standard teleportation . the goal of the protocol is to guarantee that the teleportation is successful only with the permission of the controller . optical qubits based on either superpositions of vacuum and single - photon states or superposition of coherent states are employed here to encode a tripartite maximal slice state upon which the protocol is based . we compare the performances of these two encodings under losses which are present when the qubits are guided through an optical fiber to the users . finally , we investigate the non - locality of the shared tripartite state to see whether or not it impacts the efficiency of the protocol .
