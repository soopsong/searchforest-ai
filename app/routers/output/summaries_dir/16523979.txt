a significant challenge in the development of chip - scale cavity - optomechanical devices as testbeds for quantum experiments and classical metrology lies in the coupling of light from nanoscale optical mode volumes to conventional optical components such as lenses and fibers . in this work we demonstrate a high - efficiency , single - sided fiber - optic coupling platform for optomechanical cavities . by utilizing an adiabatic waveguide taper to transform a single optical mode between a photonic crystal zipper cavity and a permanently mounted fiber , we achieve a collection efficiency for intracavity photons of 52 % at the cavity resonance wavelength of 1538 nm . an optical balanced homodyne measurement of the displacement fluctuations of the fundamental in - plane mechanical resonance at 3.3 mhz reveals that the imprecision noise floor lies a factor of 2.8 above the standard quantum limit ( sql ) for continuous position measurement , with a predicted total added noise of 1.4 phonons at the optimal probe power . the combination of extremely low measurement noise and robust fiber alignment presents significant progress towards single - phonon sensitivity for these sorts of integrated micro - optomechanical cavities .
