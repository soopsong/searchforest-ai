supraquantum nonlocality refers to correlations that are more nonlocal than allowed by quantum theory but still physically conceivable in post - quantum theories , in the sense of respecting the basic no - faster - than - light communication principle . while supraquantum correlations are relatively well understood for finite - dimensional systems , little is known in the infinite - dimensional case . here , we study supraquantum nonlocality for bipartite systems with two measurement settings and infinitely many outcomes per subsystem . we develop a formalism for generic no - signaling black - box measurement devices with continuous outputs in terms of probability measures , instead of probability distributions , which involves a few technical subtleties . we show the existence of a class of supraquantum gaussian correlations , which violate the tsirelson bound of an adequate continuous - variable bell inequality . we then introduce the continuous - variable version of the celebrated popescu - rohrlich ( pr ) boxes , as a limiting case of the above - mentioned gaussian ones . finally , we perform a characterisation of the geometry of the set of continuous - variable no - signaling correlations . namely , we show that that the convex hull of the continuous - variable pr boxes is dense in the no - signaling set . we also show that these boxes are extreme in the set of no - signaling behaviours and provide evidence suggesting that they are indeed the only extreme points of the no - signaling set . our results lay the grounds for studying generalized - probability theories in continuous - variable systems .
