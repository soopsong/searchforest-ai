we show that the quantum disentanglement eraser implemented on a two - photon system from parametric down - conversion is a general method to create hybrid photonic entanglement , namely the entanglement between different degrees of freedom of the photon pair . to demonstrate this , we generate and characterize a source with tunable degree of hybrid entanglement between two qubits , one encoded in the transverse momentum and position of a photon , and the other in the polarization of its partner . in addition , we show that a simple extension of our setup enables the generation of two - photon qubit - qudit hybrid entangled states . finally , we discuss the advantages that this type of entanglement can bring for an optical quantum network .
