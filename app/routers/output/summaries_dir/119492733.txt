when a superposition $ ( |\alpha>-|-\alpha>)$ of two coherent states with opposite phase falls upon a 50 - 50 beamsplitter , the resulting state is entangled . remarkably , the amount of entanglement is exactly 1 ebit , irrespective of $ \alpha$ , as was recently discovered by o. hirota and m. sasaki . here we discuss decoherence properties of such states and give a simple protocol that teleports one qubit encoded in schr\"odinger cat states
