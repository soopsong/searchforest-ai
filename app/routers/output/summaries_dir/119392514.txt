we study the decoherence speed limit ( dsl ) of a single impurity atom immersed in a bose - einsteincondensed ( bec ) reservoir when the impurity atom is in a double - well potential . we demonstrate how the dsl of the impurity atom can be manipulated by engineering the bec reservoir and the impurity potential within experimentally realistic limits . we show that the dsl can be controlled by changing key parameters such as the condensate scattering length , the effective dimension of the bec reservoir , and the spatial configuration of the double - well potential imposed on the impurity . we uncover the physical mechanisms of controlling the dsl at root of the spectral density of the bec reservoir .
