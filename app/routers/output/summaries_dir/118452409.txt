we present an experimental and theoretical analysis of the self- and cross - kerr effect of extended plasma resonances in josephson junction chains . we calculate the kerr coefficients by deriving and diagonalizing the hamiltonian of a linear circuit model for the chain and then adding the josephson non - linearity as a perturbation . the calculated kerr - coefficients are compared with the measurement data of a chain of 200 junctions . the kerr effect manifests itself as a frequency shift that depends linearly on the number of photons in a resonant mode . by changing the input power on a low signal level , we are able to measure this shift . the photon number is calibrated using the self - kerr shift calculated from the sample parameters . we then compare the measured cross - kerr shift with the theoretical prediction , using the calibrated photon number .
