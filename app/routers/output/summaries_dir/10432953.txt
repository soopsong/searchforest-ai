we propose blue - detuned optical traps that are suitable for trapping of both ground state and rydberg excited atoms . addition of a background compensation field or suitable choice of the trap geometry provides a magic trapping condition for ground and rydberg atoms at the trap center . deviations from the magic condition at finite temperature are calculated . designs that achieve less than 200 khz differential trap shift between cs ground and 125s rydberg states for 10 { \mu}k cs atoms are presented . consideration of the trapping potential and photoionization rates
