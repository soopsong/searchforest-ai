we give a pedagogical introduction to the process of decoherence - the irreversible emergence of classical properties through interaction with the environment . after discussing the general concepts , we present the following examples : localisation of objects , quantum zeno effect , classicality of fields and charges in qed , and decoherence in gravity theory . we finally emphasise the important interpretational features of decoherence .
