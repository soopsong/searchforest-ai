gaussian bipartite states are basic tools for the realization of quantum information protocols with continuous variables . their complete characterization is obtained by the reconstruction of the corresponding covariance matrix . here we describe in details and experimentally demonstrate a robust and reliable method to fully characterize bipartite optical gaussian states by means of a single homodyne detector . we have successfully applied our method to the bipartite states generated by a sub - threshold type - ii optical parametric oscillator which produces a pair of thermal cross - polarized entangled cw frequency degenerate beams . the method provide a reliable reconstruction of the covariance matrix and allows to retrieve all the physical information about the state under investigation . these includes observable quantities , as energy and squeezing , as well as non observable ones as purity , entropy and entanglement . our procedure also includes advanced tests for gaussianity of the state and , overall , represents a powerful tool to study bipartite gaussian state from the generation stage to the detection one .
