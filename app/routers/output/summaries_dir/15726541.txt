motivated by the recent resolution of asymptotic quantum birkhoff conjecture ( aqbc ) , we attempt to estimate the distance between a given unital quantum channel and the convex hull of unitary channels . we provide two lower bounds on this distance by employing techniques from quantum information and operator algebras , respectively . we then show how to apply these results to construct some explicit counterexamples to aqbc . we also point out an interesting connection between the grothendieck 's inequality and aqbc .
