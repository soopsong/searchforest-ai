long range quantum communication and quantum information processing require the development of light - matter interfaces for distributed quantum networks . even though photons are ideal candidates for network links to transfer quantum information , the system of choice for the realization of quantum nodes has not been identified yet . ideally , one strives for a hybrid network architecture , which will consist of different quantum systems , combining the strengths of each system . however , interfacing different quantum systems via photonic channels remains a major challenge because a detailed understanding of the underlying light - matter interaction is missing . here , we show the coherent manipulation of single photons generated on - demand from a semiconductor quantum dot using a rubidium vapor quantum memory , forming a hybrid quantum network . we demonstrate the engineering of the photons ' temporal wave function using four - level atoms and the creation of a new type of electromagnetic induced transparency for quantum dot photons on resonance with rubidium transitions . given the short lifetime of our quantum dot transition the observed dynamics can not be explained in the established steady - state picture . our results play a pivotal role in understanding quantum light - matter interactions at short time scales . these findings demonstrate a fundamental active node to construct future large - scale hybrid quantum networks .
