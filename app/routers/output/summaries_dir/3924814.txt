we demonstrate theoretically that photon - photon attraction can be engineered in the continuum of scattering states for pairs of photons propagating in a hollow - core photonic crystal fiber filled with cold atoms . the atoms are regularly spaced in an optical lattice configuration and the photons are resonantly tuned to an internal atomic transition . we show that the hard - core repulsion resulting from saturation of the atomic transitions induces bunching in the photonic component of the collective atom - photon modes ( polaritons ) . bunching is obtained in a frequency range as large as tens of ghz , and can be controlled by the inter - atomic separation . we provide a fully analytical explanation for this phenomenon by proving that correlations result from a mismatch of the quantization volumes for atomic excitations and photons in the continuum . even stronger correlations can be observed for in - gap two - polariton bound states . our theoretical results use parameters relevant for current experiments with rb atoms excited on the d2-line .
