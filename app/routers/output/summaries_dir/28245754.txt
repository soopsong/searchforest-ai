we have demonstrated a metropolitan all - pass quantum communication network in field fiber for four nodes . any two nodes of them can be connected in the network to perform quantum key distribution ( qkd ) . an optical switching module is presented that enables arbitrary 2-connectivity among output ports . integrated qkd terminals are worked out , which can operate either as a transmitter , a receiver , or even both at the same time . furthermore , an additional link in another city of 60 km fiber ( up to 130 km ) is seamless integrated into this network based on a trusted relay architecture . on all the links , we have implemented protocol of decoy state scheme . all of necessary electrical hardware , synchronization , feedback control , network software , execution of qkd protocols are made by tailored designing , which allow a completely automatical and stable running . our system has been put into operation in hefei in august 2009 , and publicly demonstrated during an evaluation conference on quantum network organized by the chinese academy of sciences on august 29 , 2009 . real - time voice telephone with one - time pad encoding between any two of the five nodes ( four all - pass nodes plus one additional node through relay ) is successfully established in the network within 60 km .
