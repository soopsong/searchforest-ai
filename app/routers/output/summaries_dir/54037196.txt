quantum algorithms require a universal set of gates that can be implemented in a physical system . for these , an optimal decomposition into a sequence of available operations is desired . here , we present a method to find such sequences for a small - scale ion trap quantum information processor . we further adapt the method to state preparation and quantum algorithms with in - sequence measurements .
