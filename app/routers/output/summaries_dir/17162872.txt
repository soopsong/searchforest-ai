we propose and analyze the implementation of a two qubit quantum gate using circular rydberg states with maximum orbital angular momentum . the intrinsic quantum gate error is limited by the finite rydberg lifetime and finite rydberg blockade shift . circular states have much longer radiative lifetimes than low orbital angular momentum states and are therefore candidates for high fidelity gate operations . we analyze the dipole - dipole interaction of two circular state rydberg atoms and present numerical simulations of quantum process tomography to find the intrinsic fidelity of a rydberg blockade controlled phase gate . our analysis shows that the intrinsic gate error can be less than $ 9 \times10^{-6}$ for circular cs atoms in a cryogenic environment .
