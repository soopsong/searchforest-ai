this paper considers the problem of robust stability for a class of uncertain quantum systems subject to unknown perturbations in the system coupling operator . a general stability result is given for a class of perturbations to the system coupling operator . then , the special case of a nominal linear quantum system is considered with non - linear perturbations to the system coupling operator . in this case , a robust stability condition is given in terms of a scaled strict bounded real condition .
