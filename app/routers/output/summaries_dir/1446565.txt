we analyze to what extent it is possible to copy arbitrary states of a two - level quantum system . we show that there exists a"universal quantum copying machine " , which approximately copies quantum mechanical states in such a way that the quality of its output does not depend on the input . we also examine a machine which combines a unitary transformation with a selective measurement to produce good copies of states in a neighborhood of a particular state . we discuss the problem of measurement of the output states .
