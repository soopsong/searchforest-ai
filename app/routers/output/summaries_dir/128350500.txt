we describe a particular class of pairs of quantum observables which are extremal in the convex set of all pairs of compatible quantum observables . the pairs in this class are constructed as uniformly noisy versions of two mutually unbiased bases ( mub ) with possibly different noise intensities affecting each basis . we show that not all pairs of mub can be used in this construction , and we provide a criterion for determiniing those mub that actually do yield extremal compatible observables . we apply our criterion to all pairs of fourier conjugate mub , and we prove that in this case extremality is achieved if and only if the quantum system hilbert space is odd - dimensional . remarkably , this fact is no longer true for general non - fourier conjugate mub , as we show in an example . therefore , the presence or the absence of extremality is a concrete geometric manifestation of mub inequivalence , that already materializes by comparing sets of no more than two bases at a time .
