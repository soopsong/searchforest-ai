most studies in multiparameter estimation assume the dynamics is fixed and focus on identifying the optimal probe state and the optimal measurements . in practice , however , controls are usually available to alter the dynamics , which provides another degree of freedom . in this paper we employ optimal control methods , particularly the gradient ascent pulse engineering ( grape ) , to design optimal controls for the improvement of the precision limit in multiparameter estimation . we show that the controlled schemes not only capable to provide a higher precision limit , but also have a higher stability to the inaccuracy of the time point performing the measurements . this high time stability will benefit the practical metrology where it is hard to perform the measurement at a very accurate time point due to the response time of the measurement apparatus .
