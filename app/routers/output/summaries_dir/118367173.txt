we consider the $ \varphi_{1,3}$ off - critical perturbation $ { \cal m}(m , m';t)$ of the general non - unitary minimal models where $ 2\le m\le m'$ and $ m , m'$ are coprime and $ t$ measures the departure from criticality corresponding to the $ \varphi_{1,3}$ integrable perturbation . we view these models as the continuum scaling limit in the ferromagnetic regime iii of the forrester - baxter restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) models on the square lattice . we also consider the rsos models in the antiferromagnetic regime ii related in the continuum scaling limit to $ \mathbb{z}_n$ parfermions with $ n = m'-2$. using an elliptic yang - baxter algebra of planar tiles encoding the allowed face configurations , we obtain the hamiltonians of the associated quantum chains defined as the logarithmic derivative of the transfer matrices with periodic boundary conditions . the transfer matrices and hamiltonians act on a vector space of paths on the $ a_{m'-1}$ dynkin diagram whose dimension is counted by generalized fibonacci numbers .
