measurement based quantum computation requires the generation of a cluster state ( quantum resource ) prior to starting a computation . generation of this entangled state can be difficult with many schemes already proposed . we present an abstract scheme which can create 2d cluster states as a universal resource for quantum computing . we find a linear scaling of grid size with cluster depth . the scheme is also capable of creating more exotic topologies including 3d structures and the unit cell for topological error correction . we note its relevance to the cavity qed scheme in [ 30 ] although it could be applied to various architectures .
