we derive a master equation from the exact stochastic liouville von - neumann ( sln ) equation \cite{stockburger2002,wallsbook } . the latter depends on two correlated noises and describes exactly the dynamics of an oscillator ( which can be either harmonic or present an anharmonicity ) coupled to an environment at thermal equilibrium . the newly derived master equation is obtained by performing analytically the average over different noise trajectories . it is found to have a complex hierarchical structure that might be helpful to explain the convergence problems occurring when performing numerically the stochastic average of trajectories given by the sln equation \cite{koch2008,koch2010 } .
