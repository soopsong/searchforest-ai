the purpose of this paper is to propose quantum filters for a two - level atom driven by two continuous - mode counter - propagating photons and under continuous measurements . two scenarios of multiple measurements , 1 ) homodyne detection plus photodetection , and 2 ) two homodyne detections , are discussed . filtering equations for both cases are derived explicitly . as demonstration , the two input photons with rising exponential and gaussian pulse shapes are used to excite a two - level atom under two homodyne detection measurements . simulations reveal scaling relations between atom - photon coupling and photonic pulse shape for maximum atomic excitation .
