we present numerical study of a model of quantum walk in periodic potential on the line . we take the simple view that different potentials affect differently the way the coin state of the walker is changed . for simplicity and definiteness , we assume the walker 's coin state is unaffected at sites without potential , and is rotated in an unbiased way according to hadamard matrix at sites with potential . this is the simplest and most natural model of a quantum walk in a periodic potential with two coins . six generic cases of such quantum walks were studied numerically . it is found that of the six cases , four cases display significant localization effect , where the walker is confined in the neighborhood of the origin for sufficiently long times . associated with such localization effect is the recurrence of the probability of the walker returning to the neighborhood of the origin .
