a general scheme is presented for controlling quantum systems using evolution driven by non - selective von neumann measurements , with or without an additional tailored electromagnetic field . as an example , a 2-level quantum system controlled by non - selective quantum measurements is considered . the control goal is to find optimal system observables such that consecutive non - selective measurement of these observables transforms the system from a given initial state into a state which maximizes the expected value of a target operator ( the objective ) . a complete analytical solution is found including explicit expressions for the optimal measured observables and for the maximal objective value given any target operator , any initial system density matrix , and any number of measurements . as an illustration , upper bounds on measurement - induced population transfer between the ground and the excited states for any number of measurements are found . the anti - zeno effect is recovered in the limit of an infinite number of measurements . in this limit the system becomes completely controllable . the results establish the degree of control attainable by a finite number of measurements .
