measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution with a finite number of decoy states is analyzed under finite - data - size assumption . by accounting for statistical fluctuations in parameter estimation , we investigate vacuum+weak- and vacuum+two - weak - decoy - state protocols . in each case , we find proper operation regimes , where the performance of our system is comparable to the asymptotic case for which the key size and the number of decoy states approach infinity . our results show that practical implementations of this scheme can be both secure and efficient .
