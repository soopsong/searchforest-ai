we propose an efficient numerical method to compute configuration averages of observables in disordered open quantum systems whose dynamics can be unraveled via stochastic trajectories . we prove that the optimal sampling of trajectories and disorder configurations is simply achieved by considering one random disorder configuration for each individual trajectory . as a first application , we exploit the present method to the study the role of disorder on the physics of the driven - dissipative bose - hubbard model in two different regimes : ( i ) for strong interactions , we explore the dissipative physics of fermionized bosons in disordered one - dimensional chains ; ( ii ) for weak interactions , we investigate the role of on - site inhomogeneities on a first - order dissipative phase transition in a two - dimensional square lattice .
