the coupling between a superconducting qubit and a control line inevitably results in radiative decay of the qubit into the line . we propose a josephson quantum filter ( jqf ) , which protects the data qubit ( dq ) from radiative decay through the control line without reducing the gate speed on dq . jqf consists of a qubit strongly coupled to the control line to dq , and its working principle is a subradiance effect characteristic to waveguide quantum electrodynamics setups . jqf is a passive circuit element and is therefore suitable for integration in a scalable superconducting qubit system .
