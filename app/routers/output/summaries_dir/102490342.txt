we investigate numerically and experimentally the near - field response of disordered arrays comprising asymmetrically split ring resonators that exhibit strong cooperative response . our simulations treat the unit cell split ring resonators as discrete pointlike oscillators with associated electric and magnetic point dipole radiation , while the strong cooperative radiative coupling between the different split rings is fully included at all orders . the methods allow to calculate local field and purcell factor enhancement arising from the collective electric and magnetic excitations . we find substantially increased standard deviation of the purcell - enhancement with disorder , making it increasingly likely to find collective excitation eigenmodes with very high purcell factors that are also stronger for magnetic than electric excitations . we show that disorder can dramatically modify the cooperative response of the metamaterial even in the presence of strong dissipation losses as is the case for plasmonic systems . our analysis in terms of collective eigenmodes paves a way for controlled engineering of electromagnetic device functionalities based on strongly interacting metamaterial arrays .
