quantum teleportation is an essential quantum operation by which we can transfer an unknown quantum state to a remote location with the help of quantum entanglement and classical communication . since the first experimental demonstrations using photonic qubits and continuous variables , the distance of photonic quantum teleportation over free space channels has continued to increase and has reached>100 km . on the other hand , quantum teleportation over optical fiber has been challenging , mainly because the multi - fold photon detection that inevitably accompanies quantum teleportation experiments has been very inefficient due to the relatively low detection efficiencies of typical telecom - band single photon detectors . here , we report efficient quantum teleportation over optical fiber using four high - detection efficiency superconducting nanowire superconducting single - photon detectors ( snspd ) based on mosi . these snspds make it possible to perform highly - efficient multi - fold photon measurements , allowing us to confirm that the quantum states of input photons were successfully teleported over 100 km of fiber .
