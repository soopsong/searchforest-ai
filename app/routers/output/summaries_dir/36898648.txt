quantum squeezing of mechanical resonator is important for studying the macroscopic quantum effects and the precision metrology of weak forces . here we give a theoretical study of a hybrid atom - optomechanical system in which the steady - state squeezing of the mechanical resonator can be generated via the mechanical nonlinearity and cavity cooling process . the validity of the scheme is assessed by simulating the steady - state variance of the mechanical displacement quadrature numerically . the scheme is robust against dissipation of the optical cavity , and the steady - state squeezing can be effectively generated in a highly dissipative cavity .
