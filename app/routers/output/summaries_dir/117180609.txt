this thesis is a theoretical analysis of sample two- and one - dimensional systems . the twodimensional examples are the quantum hall liquid and anomalous paired states . the most widely accepted effective theory of the quantum hall liquid is based on the so - called chern simons lagrangian , but it is not entirely satisfactory . we obtain the first derivation of an alternative effective theory from microscopic principles . our formulation allows for a first principles derivation of physical quantities such as the effective mass and compressibility and contains the first analytical observation of the magnetoroton . the formalism developed along the way is also applied to paired states in anomalous supeconductors , a topic of much recent interest . the one - dimenisonal system is the carbon nanotube . gas uptake in nanotube bundles is currently attracting a wealth of research with both applied and fundamental implications . we propose adsorption of gases on the surface of a single tube , finding strong correlations and symmetries that have not been observed yet . the properties of these states are directly relevant to other one - dimensional structures such as spin ladders and stripes and raise interesting and open questions .
