we give an explicit prescription for experimentally determining the evolution operators which completely describe the dynamics of a quantum mechanical black box -- an arbitrary open quantum system . we show necessary and sufficient conditions for this to be possible , and illustrate the general theory by considering specifically one and two quantum bit systems . these procedures may be useful in the comparative evaluation of experimental quantum measurement , communication , and computation systems .
