characterizing complex quantum systems is a vital task in quantum information science . quantum tomography , the standard tool used for this purpose , uses a well - designed measurement record to reconstruct quantum states and processes . it is , however , notoriously inefficient . recently , the classical signal reconstruction technique known as"compressed sensing"has been ported to quantum information science to overcome this challenge : accurate tomography can be achieved with substantially fewer measurement settings , thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of quantum tomography . here we show that compressed sensing tomography of quantum systems is essentially guaranteed by a special property of quantum mechanics itself --- that the mathematical objects that describe the system in quantum mechanics are matrices with nonnegative eigenvalues . this result has an impact on the way quantum tomography is understood and implemented . in particular , it implies that the information obtained about a quantum system through compressed sensing methods exhibits a new sense of"informational completeness . "this has important consequences on the efficiency of data taking for quantum tomography , and enables us to construct informationally complete measurements that are robust to noise and modeling errors . moreover , our result shows that one can expand the numerical tool - box used in quantum tomography and employ highly efficient algorithms developed to handle large dimensional matrices on a large dimensional hilbert space . while we mainly present our results in the context of quantum tomography , they apply to the general case of positive semidefinite matrix recovery .
