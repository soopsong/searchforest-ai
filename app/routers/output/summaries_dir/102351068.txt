high - fidelity qubit initialization is of significance for efficient error correction in fault tolerant quantum algorithms . combining two best worlds , speed and robustness , to achieve high - fidelity state preparation and manipulation is challenging in quantum systems , where qubits are closely spaced in frequency . motivated by the concept of shortcut to adiabaticity , we theoretically propose the shortcut pulses via inverse engineering and further optimize the pulses with respect to systematic errors in frequency detuning and rabi frequency . such protocol , relevant to frequency selectivity , is applied to rare - earth ions qubit system , where the excitation of frequency - neighboring qubits should be prevented as well . furthermore , comparison with adiabatic complex hyperbolic secant pulses shows that these dedicated initialization pulses can reduce the time that ions spend in the excited state by a factor of 6 , which is important in coherence time limited systems to approach an error rate manageable by quantum error correction . the approach may also be applicable to superconducting qubits , and any other systems where qubits are addressed in frequency .
