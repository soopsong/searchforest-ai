we have investigated high - precision measurements , beyond the standard quantum limit , utilizing non - classical states . although entanglement has been considered a resource for achieving the heisenberg limit in measurements , we show that any advantage expected from using entanglement is dependent on the measurement in question . we investigate several measurement scenarios and illustrate the role of entanglement as a resource for quantum high - precision measurement . in particular , we demonstrate that there is a regime wherein entanglement not only does not help , but prevents the achievement of the fundamental limit .
