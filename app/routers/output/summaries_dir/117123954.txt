we investigate the statistical properties of the photon - subtractions from the two - mode squeezed vacuum state and its decoherence in a thermal environment . it is found that the state can be considered as a squeezed two - variable hermite polynomial excitation vacuum and the normalization of this state is the jacobi polynomial of the squeezing parameter . the compact expression for wigner function ( wf ) is also derived analytically by using the weyl ordered operators ' invariance under similar transformations . especially , the nonclassicality is discussed in terms of the negativity of wf . the effect of decoherence on this state is then discussed by deriving the analytical time evolution results of wf . it is shown that the wf is always positive for any squeezing parameter and photon - subtraction number if the decay time exceeds an upper bound ( } $ \kappa t>{1/2}\ln \frac{2\bar{n}+2}{2\bar{n}+1 } ) .
