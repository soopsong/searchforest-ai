entanglement is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics , and is a primary resource in quantum information systems . its manipulation remains a central challenge in the development of quantum technology . in this work , we demonstrate a device which can generate , manipulate , and analyse two - qubit entangled states , using miniature and mass - manufacturable silicon photonics . by combining four photon - pair sources with a reconfigurable six - mode interferometer , embedding a switchable entangling gate , we generate two - qubit entangled states , manipulate their entanglement , and analyse them , all in the same silicon chip . using quantum state tomography , we show how our source can produce a range of entangled and separable states , and how our switchable controlled - z gate operates on them , entangling them or making them separable depending on its configuration .
