freedman , kitaev , and wang [ arxiv : quant - ph/0001071 ] , and later aharonov , jones , and landau [ arxiv : quant - ph/0511096 ] , established a quantum algorithm to"additively"approximate the jones polynomial v(l , t ) at any principal root of unity t. the strength of this additive approximation depends exponentially on the bridge number of the link presentation . freedman , larsen , and wang [ arxiv : math/0103200 ] established that the approximation is universal for quantum computation at a non - lattice , principal root of unity ; and aharonov and arad [ arxiv : quant - ph/0605181 ] established a uniform version of this result . in this article , we show that any value - dependent approximation of the jones polynomial at these non - lattice roots of unity is # p - hard . if given the power to decide whether |v(l , t)|>a or |v(l , t)|b>0 , there is a polynomial - time algorithm to exactly count the solutions to arbitrary combinatorial equations . in our argument , the result follows fairly directly from the universality result and aaronson 's theorem that postbqp = pp [ arxiv : quant - ph/0412187 ] .
