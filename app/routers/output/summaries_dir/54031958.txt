detection of entanglement in quantum networks consisting of many parties is one of the important steps towards building quantum communication and computation networks . we consider a scenario where the measurement devices used for this certification are uncharacterised . in this case , it is well known that by using quantum states as inputs for the measurement devices it is possible to detect any entangled state ( a situation known as measurement device - independent entanglement witnessing ) . here we go beyond entanglement detection and provide methods to estimate the amount of entanglement in a quantum network . we also consider the task of randomness certification and show that randomness can be certified in a variety of cases , including single - partite experiments or setups using only separable states .
