we propose an interferometric measurement of weak forces using a single ion subjected to designed time - dependent spin - dependent forces . explicit expressions of the relation between the unknown force and the final populations are found considering different scenarios , such as the weak force acting on two branches , on one branch , or having errors in the driving force . the flexibility to design the trap trajectories is used to minimize errors due to anharmonicities in the trap . the advantages of the approach are the use of geometrical phases , which provides stability , the possibility to design faster - than - adiabatic processes with sensitivity control , and the independence of the results on the motional states for the small - oscillations regime in which the effective potentials are purely harmonic .
