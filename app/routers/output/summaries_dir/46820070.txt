weakly coupled high - q nanophotonic cavities are building blocks of slow - light waveguides and other nanophotonic devices . their functionality critically depends on tuning as resonance frequencies should stay within the bandwidth of the device . unavoidable disorder leads to random frequency shifts which cause localization of the light in single cavities . we present a new method to finely tune individual resonances of light in a system of coupled nanocavities . we use holographic laser - induced heating and address thermal crosstalk between nanocavities using a response matrix approach . as a main result we observe a simultaneous anticrossing of 3 nanophotonic resonances , which were initially split by disorder .
