feedback is the core concept in cybernetics and its effective use has made great success in but not limited to the fields of engineering , biology , and computer science . when feedback is used to quantum systems , two major types of feedback control protocols including coherent feedback control ( cfc ) and measurement - based feedback control ( mfc ) have been developed . in this paper , we compare the two types of quantum feedback control protocols by focusing on the real - time information used in the feedback loop and the capability in dealing with parameter uncertainty . an equivalent relationship is established between quantum cfc and non - selective quantum mfc in the form of operator - sum representation . using several examples of quantum feedback control , we show that quantum mfc can theoretically achieve better performance than quantum cfc in stabilizing a quantum state and dealing with hamiltonian parameter uncertainty . the results enrich understanding of the relative advantages between quantum mfc and quantum cfc , and can provide useful information in choosing suitable feedback protocols for quantum systems .
