we have measured individual tunneling events and coulomb step shapes in single - electron boxes with opaque superconductor - normal metal tunnel junctions . we observe anomalous broadening of the coulomb step with decreasing temperature in a manner that is consistent with activation of first - order tunneling events by an external dissipative electromagnetic environment . we demonstrate that the rates for energetically unfavourable tunneling events saturate to finite values at low temperatures , and that the saturation level can be suppressed by more than an order of magnitude by a capacitive shunt near the device . the findings are important in assessing the performance limits of any single - electronic device . in particular , master equation based simulations show that the electromagnetic environment realized in the capacitively shunted devices allows for a metrologically accurate charge pump based on hybrid tunnnel junctions .
