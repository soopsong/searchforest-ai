based on the exact dynamics of a two - qubit system and environment , we investigate system - environment ( se ) quantum and classical correlations . the coupling is chosen to represent a dephasing channel for one of the qubits and the environment is a proper thermal bath . first we discuss the general issue of dilation for qubit phase damping . based on the usual thermal bath of harmonic oscillators , we derive criteria of separability and entanglement between an initial $ x$ state and the environment . applying these criteria to initial werner states , we find that entanglement between the system and environment is built up in time for temperatures below a certain critical temperature $ t_{\mathrm{crit}}$. on the other hand , the total state remains separable during those short times that are relevant for decoherence and loss of entanglement in the two - qubit state . close to $ t_{\mathrm{crit}}$ the se correlations oscillate between separable and entangled . even though these oscillations are also observed in the entanglement between the two qubits , no simple relation between the loss of entanglement in the two - qubit system and the build - up of entanglement between the system and environment is found .
