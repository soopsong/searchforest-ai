we introduce techniques to analyze unitary operations in terms of quadratic form expansions , a form similar to a sum over paths in the computational basis when the phase contributed by each path is described by a quadratic form over $ \mathbb r$. we show how to relate such a form to an entangled resource akin to that of the one - way measurement model of quantum computing . using this , we describe various conditions under which it is possible to efficiently implement a unitary operation u , either when provided a quadratic form expansion for u as input , or by finding a quadratic form expansion for u from other input data .
