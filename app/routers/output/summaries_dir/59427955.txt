a large class of quantum algorithms can be represented by placing a reversible classical circuit , or diagonal gates , between a pair of quantum fourier transformations . notable examples include the circuit from shor 's factoring algorithm and iqp circuits . here we study quantum circuits with a similar structure , where the qft has been replaced by a sequentially coupled quantum schur transform . we extend the kushilevitz - mansour algorithm for sampling from fourier - sparse output distributions to these circuits . it is shown that samples from a classical distribution close to the output of a sparse schur circuit can be efficiently generated by this classical method . in particular , it implies that circuits as found in a computationally interesting regime of permutational quantum computing can be sampled from efficiently classically , assuming they give rise to sparse output distributions . numerical simulations indicate that a significant fraction of permutational circuits on a small number of qubits have this property , allowing for efficient sampling of their output .
