quantum detector tomography is a fundamental technique for calibrating quantum devices and performing quantum engineering tasks . in this paper , a novel quantum detector tomography method is proposed . first , a series of different probe states are used to generate measurement data . then , using constrained linear regression estimation , a stage-1 estimation of the detector is obtained . finally , the positive semidefinite requirement is added to guarantee a physical stage-2 estimation . this two - stage estimation ( tse ) method has computational complexity $ o(nd^2m)$ , where $ n$ is the number of $ d$-dimensional detector matrices and $ m$ is the number of different probe states . an error upper bound is established , and optimization on the coherent probe states is investigated . we perform simulation and a quantum optical experiment to testify the effectiveness of the tse method .
