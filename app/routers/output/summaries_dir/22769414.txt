quantum metrology has many important applications in science and technology , ranging from frequency spectroscopy to gravitational wave detection . quantum mechanics imposes a fundamental limit on measurement precision , called the heisenberg limit , which can be achieved for noiseless quantum systems , but is not achievable in general for systems subject to noise . here we study how measurement precision can be enhanced through quantum error correction , a general method for protecting a quantum system from the damaging effects of noise . we find a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving the heisenberg limit using quantum probes subject to markovian noise , assuming that noiseless ancilla systems are available , and that fast , accurate quantum processing can be performed . when the sufficient condition is satisfied , a quantum error - correcting code can be constructed which suppresses the noise without obscuring the signal ; the optimal code , achieving the best possible precision , can be found by solving a semidefinite program .
