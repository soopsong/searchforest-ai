in this paper we use optimal control to design minimum - time adiabatic - like paths for the expansion of a quantum piston . under realistic experimental constraints , we calculate the minimum expansion time and compare it with that obtained from a state of the art inverse engineering method . we use this result to rederive the known upper bound for the cooling rate of a refrigerator , which provides a quantitative description for the unattainability of absolute zero , the third law of thermodynamics . we finally point out the relation of the present work to the fast adiabatic - like expansion of an accordion optical lattice , a system which can be used to magnify the initial quantum state ( quantum microscope ) .
