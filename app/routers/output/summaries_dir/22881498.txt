the propagation of several spatial modes has a significant impact on the structure of the emission from parametric down - conversion in a nonlinear waveguide . this manifests itself not only in the spatial correlations of the photon pairs but also , due to new phase - matching conditions , in the output spectrum , radically altering the degree of entanglement within each pair . here we investigate both theoretically and experimentally the results of higher - order spatial - mode propagation in nonlinear waveguides . we derive conditions for the creation of pairs in these modes and present observations of higher - order mode propagation in both the spatial and spectral domains . furthermore , we observe correlations between the different degrees of freedom and finally we discuss strategies for mitigating any detrimental effects and optimizing pair production in the fundamental mode .
