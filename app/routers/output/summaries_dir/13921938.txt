we present a derivation of the von neumann entropy and mutual information of arbitrary two -- mode gaussian states , based on the explicit determination of the symplectic eigenvalues of a generic covariance matrix . the key role of the symplectic invariants in such a determination is pointed out . we show that the von neumann entropy depends on two symplectic invariants , while the purity ( or the linear entropy ) is determined by only one invariant , so that the two quantities provide two different hierarchies of mixed gaussian states . a comparison between mutual information and entanglement of formation for symmetric states is considered , remarking the crucial role of the symplectic eigenvalues in qualifying and quantifying the correlations present in a generic state .
