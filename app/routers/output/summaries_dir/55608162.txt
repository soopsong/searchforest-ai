we present a general criterion for entanglement of n indistinguishable particles decomposed into arbitrary s subsystems based on the unambiguous measurability of correlation . our argument provides a unified viewpoint on the entanglement of indistinguishable particles , which is still unsettled despite various proposals made mainly for the s = 2 case . even though entanglement is defined only with reference to the measurement setup , we find that the so - called i.i.d . states form a special class of bosonic states which are universally separable .
