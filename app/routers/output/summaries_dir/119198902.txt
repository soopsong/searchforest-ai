we address the joint estimation of the two defining parameters of a displacement operation in phase space . in a measurement scheme based on a gaussian probe field and two homodyne detectors , it is shown that both conjugated parameters can be measured below the standard quantum limit when the probe field is entangled . we derive the most informative cram\'er - rao bound , providing the theoretical benchmark on the estimation and observe that our scheme is nearly optimal for a wide parameter range characterizing the probe field . we discuss the role of the entanglement as well as the relation between our measurement strategy and the generalized uncertainty relations .
