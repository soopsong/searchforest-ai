we investigate unitary operators acting on a tensor product space , with the property that the quantum channels they generate , via the stinespring dilation theorem , are of a particular type , independently of the state of the ancilla system in the stinespring relation . the types of quantum channels we consider are those of interest in quantum information theory : unitary conjugations , constant channels , unital channels , mixed unitary channels , ppt channels , and entanglement breaking channels . for some of the classes of bipartite unitary operators corresponding to the above types of channels , we provide explicit characterizations , necessary and/or sufficient conditions for membership , and we compute the dimension of the corresponding algebraic variety . inclusions between these classes are considered , and we show that for small dimensions , many of these sets are identical .
