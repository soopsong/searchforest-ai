entangling gates between qubits are a crucial component for performing algorithms in quantum computers . however , any quantum algorithm must ultimately operate on error - protected logical qubits encoded in high - dimensional systems . typically , logical qubits are encoded in multiple two - level systems , but entangling gates operating on such qubits are highly complex and have not yet been demonstrated . here , we realize a controlled not ( cnot ) gate between two multiphoton qubits in two microwave cavities . in this approach , we encode a qubit in the high - dimensional space of a single cavity mode , rather than in multiple two - level systems . we couple two such encoded qubits together through a transmon , which is driven by an rf pump to apply the gate within 190 ns . this is two orders of magnitude shorter than the decoherence time of the transmon , enabling a high - fidelity gate operation . these results are an important step towards universal algorithms on error - corrected logical qubits .
