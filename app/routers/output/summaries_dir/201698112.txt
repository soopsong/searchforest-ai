we study how to efficiently control an interacting few - body system consisting of three harmonically trapped bosons . specifically we investigate the process of modulating the interparticle interactions to drive an initially non - interacting state to a strongly interacting one , which is an eigenstate of a chosen hamiltonian . we also show that for unbalanced subsystems , where one can individually control the different inter- and intra - species interactions , complex dynamics originates when the symmetry of the ground state is broken by phase separation . however , as driving the dynamics too quickly can result in unwanted excitations of the final state , we optimize the driven processes using shortcuts to adiabaticity , which are designed to reduce these excitations at the end of the interaction ramp ensuring that the target eigenstate is reached .
