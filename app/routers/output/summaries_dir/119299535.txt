bosonic quadratic hamiltonians , often called bogoliubov hamiltonians , play an important role in the theory of many - boson systems where they arise in a natural way as an approximation to the full many - body problem . in this note we would like to give an overview of recent advances in the study of bosonic quadratic hamiltonians . in particular , we relate the reported results to what can be called the time - dependent diagonalization problem .
