we propose and analyse a robust quantum state transfer protocol by the use of a combination of coherent quantum coupling and decoherence - free subspaces in a coupled quantum spin chain . under decoherence , an arbitrary unknown quantum state embedded in a decoherence - free subspace can be perfectly transferred through a noisy channel being weakly coupled to two end registers . the method protects quantum information from both the channel noise and the environmental decoherence . a special case of utilizing two physical qubits to encode one logical qubit is considered as an example and the robustness is confirmed by numerical performances .
