the noisy intermediate - scale quantum ( nisq ) technology is currently investigated by major players in the field to build the first practically useful quantum computer . ibm qx architectures are the first ones which are already publicly available today . however , in order to use them , the respective quantum circuits have to be compiled for the respectively used target architecture . while first approaches have been proposed for this purpose , they are infeasible for a certain set of su(4 ) quantum circuits which have recently been introduced to benchmark corresponding compilers . in this work , we analyze the bottlenecks of existing compilers and provide a dedicated method for compiling this kind of circuits to ibm qx architectures . our experimental evaluation ( using tools provided by ibm ) shows that the proposed approach significantly outperforms ibm 's own solution regarding fidelity of the compiled circuit as well as runtime . moreover , the solution proposed in this work has been declared winner of the ibm qiskit developer challenge . an implementation of the proposed methodology is publicly available at http://iic.jku.at/eda/research/ibm_qx_mapping .
