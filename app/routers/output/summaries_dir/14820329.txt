the one clean qubit model ( or the dqc1 model ) is a restricted model of quantum computing where only a single input qubit is pure and all other input qubits are maximally mixed . in spite of the severe restriction , the model can solve several problems ( such as calculating jones polynomials ) whose classical efficient solutions are not known . furthermore , it was shown that if the output probability distribution of the one clean qubit model can be classically efficiently sampled with a constant multiplicative error , then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the second level . is it possible to improve the multiplicative error hardness result to a constant total variation distance error one like other sub - universal quantum computing models such as the iqp model , the boson sampling model , and the fourier sampling model ? in this paper , we show that it is indeed possible if we accept a modified version of the average case hardness conjecture . interestingly , the anti - concentration lemma can be easily shown by using the special property of the one clean qubit model that each output probability is so small that no concentration occurs .
