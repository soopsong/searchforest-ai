we address the problem of decoding sparse quantum error correction codes . for pauli channels , this task can be accomplished by a version of the belief propagation algorithm used for decoding sparse classical codes . quantum codes pose two new challenges however . firstly , their tanner graph unavoidably contain small loops which typically undermines the performance of belief propagation . secondly , sparse quantum codes are by definition highly degenerate . the standard belief propagation algorithm does not exploit this feature , but rather it is impaired by it . we propose heuristic methods to improve belief propagation decoding , specifically targeted at these two problems . while our results exhibit a clear improvement due to the proposed heuristic methods , they also indicate that the main source of errors in the quantum coding scheme remains in the decoding .
