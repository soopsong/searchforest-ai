we address correlated few - photon transport in one - dimensional waveguides coupled to a two - level system ( tls ) , such as an atom or a quantum dot . we derive exactly the single - photon and two - photon current ( transmission ) for linear and nonlinear ( tight - binding sinusoidal ) energy - momentum dispersion relations of photons in the waveguides and compare the results for the different dispersions . a large enhancement of the two - photon current for the sinusoidal dispersion has been seen at a certain transition energy of the tls away from the single - photon resonances .
