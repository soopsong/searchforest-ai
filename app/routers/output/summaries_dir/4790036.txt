in quantum optics , photonic schr\"odinger cats are superpositions of two coherent states with opposite phases and with a significant number of photons . recently , these states have been observed in the transient dynamics of driven - dissipative resonators subject to engineered two - photon processes . here we present an exact analytical solution of the steady - state density matrix for this class of systems , including one - photon losses , which are considered detrimental for the achievement of cat states . we demonstrate that the unique steady state is a statistical mixture of two cat - like states with opposite parity , in spite of significant one - photon losses . the transient dynamics to the steady state depends dramatically on the initial state and can pass through a metastable regime lasting orders of magnitudes longer than the photon lifetime . by considering individual quantum trajectories in photon - counting configuration , we find that the system intermittently jumps between two cats . finally , we propose and study a feedback protocol based on this behaviour to generate a pure cat - like steady state .
