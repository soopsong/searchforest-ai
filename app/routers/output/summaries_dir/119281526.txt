we propose a scheme for implementing cross kerr nonlinearity between two superconducting transmission line resonators ( tlr ) via their interaction with a coupler which is constructed by two superconducting charge qubits connected to each other via a superconducting quantum interference device . when suitably driven , the coupler can induce very strong cross phase modulation ( xpm ) between the two tlrs due to its n - type level structure and the consequent electromagnetically induced transparency in its lowest states . the flexibility of our design can lead to various inter - tlr coupling configurations . the obtained cross kerr coefficient is large enough to allow many important quantum operations in which only few photons are involved . we further show that this scheme is very robust against the fluctuations in solid state circuits . our numerical calculations imply that the absorption and dispersion resulted from the decoherence of the coupler are very small compared with the strength of the proposed xpm .
