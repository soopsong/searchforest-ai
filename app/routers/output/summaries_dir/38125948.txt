selfcomplementary quantum channels are characterized by such an interaction between the principal quantum system and the environment that leads to the same output states of both interacting systems . these maps can describe approximate quantum copy machines , as perfect copying of an unknown quantum state is not possible due to the celebrated no - cloning theorem . we provide here a parametrization of a large class of selfcomplementary channels and analyze their properties . selfcomplementary channels preserve some residual coherences and residual entanglement . investigating some measures of non - markovianity we show that time evolution under selfcomplementary channels is highly non - markovian .
