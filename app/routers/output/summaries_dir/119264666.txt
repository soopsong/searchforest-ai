we quantify and analyze the controller 's power in controlled remote state preparation schemes . our analysis provides a lower bound on the control power required for controlled remote preparation of arbitrary d - dimensional states . we evaluate several existing controlled remote state preparation protocols and show that some proposed non - maximally entangled channels are not suitable for perfect controlled remote preparation of arbitrary quantum states from the con- troller 's point of view . we find that for remotely preparing d - dimensional states , the entropy of each controller should be no less than log_2 d bits . our criteria are not only useful for evaluating controlled remote state preparation schemes but can also be used for other controlled quantum communication schemes .
