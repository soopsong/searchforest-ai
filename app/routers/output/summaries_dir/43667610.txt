by jointly using quantum zeno dynamics and the approach of"transitionless quantum driving ( tqd)"proposed by berry to construct shortcuts to adiabatic passage ( stap ) , we propose an efficient scheme to fast generate multiatom greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states in separate cavities connected by opitical fibers only by one - step manipulation . we first detail the generation of the three - atom ghz states via tqd , then , we compare the proposed tqd scheme with the traditional ones with adiabatic passage . at last , the influence of various decoherence factors , such as spontaneous emission , cavity decay and fiber photon leakage , is discussed by numerical simulations . all the results show that the present tqd scheme is fast and insensitive to atomic spontaneous emission and fiber photon leakage . furthermore , the scheme can be directly generalized to realize n - atom ghz states generation by the same principle in theory .
