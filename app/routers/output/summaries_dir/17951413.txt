in the search of appropriate riemannian metrics on quantum state space the concept of statistical monotonicity , or contraction under coarse graining , has been proposed by chentsov . the metrics with this property have been classified by petz . all the elements of this family of geometries can be seen as quantum analogues of fisher information . although there exists a number of general theorems sheding light on this subject , many natural questions , also stemming from applications , are still open . in this paper we discuss a particular member of the family , the wigner - yanase information . using a well - known approach that mimics the classical pull - back approach to fisher information , we are able to give explicit formulae for the geodesic distance , the geodesic path , the sectional and scalar curvatures associated to wigner - yanase information . moreover we show that this is the only monotone metric for which such an approach is possible .
