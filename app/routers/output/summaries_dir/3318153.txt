parallelized quantum information processing requires tailored quantum memories to simultaneously handle multiple photons . the spatial degree of freedom is a promising candidate to facilitate such photonic multiplexing . using a single - photon resolving camera we demonstrate a wavevector multiplexed quantum memory based on a cold atomic ensemble . observation of nonclassical correlations between raman scattered photons is confirmed by an average value of the second - order correlation function $ g_{\mathrm{{s , as}}}^{(2)}=72\pm5 $ in 665 separated modes simultaneously . the proposed protocol utilizing the multimode memory along with the camera will facilitate generation of multi - photon states , which are a necessity in quantum - enhanced sensing technologies and as an input to photonic quantum circuits .
