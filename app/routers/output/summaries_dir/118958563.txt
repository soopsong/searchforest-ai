bochner 's theorem gives the necessary and sufficient conditions on a function such that its fourier transform corresponds to a true probability density function . in the wigner phase space picture , quantum bochner 's theorem gives the necessary and sufficient conditions on a function such that it is a quantum characteristic function of a valid ( and possibly mixed ) quantum state and such that its fourier transform is a true probability density . we extend this theorem to discrete phase space representations which possess enough symmetry . more precisely , we show that discrete phase space representations that are built on projective unitary representations of abelian groups , with a slight restriction on admissible 2-cocycles , enable a quantum bochner 's theorem .
