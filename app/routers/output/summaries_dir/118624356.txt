nonselective quantum measurements , i.e. , measurements without reading the results , are often considered as a resource for manipulating quantum systems . in this work , we investigate optimal acceleration of the landau - zener ( lz ) transitions by non - selective quantum measurements . we use the measurements of a population of a diabatic state of the lz system at certain time instants as control and find the optimal time instants which maximize the lz transition . we find surprising nonmonotonic behavior of the maximal transition probability with increase of the coupling parameter when the number of measurements is large . this transition probability gives an optimal approximation to the fundamental quantum zeno effect ( which corresponds to continuous measurements ) by a fixed number of discrete measurements . the difficulty for the analysis is that the transition probability as a function of time instants has a huge number of local maxima . we resolve this problem both analytically by asymptotic analysis and numerically by the development of efficient algorithms mainly based on the dynamic programming . the proposed numerical methods can be applied , besides this problem , to a wide class of measurement - based optimal control problems .
