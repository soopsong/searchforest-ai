we investigate theoretically the temporal behavior of a quantum dot under off - resonant optical excitation targeted at fast acoustic phonon - assisted state preparation . we demonstrate that in a preparation process driven by short laser pulses three processes can be identified : a dressing of the states during the switch on of the laser pulse , a subsequent phonon - induced relaxation and an undressing at the end of the pulse . by analyzing excitation scenarios with different pulse shapes we highlight the decisive impact of an adiabatic undressing on the final state in short pulse protocols . furthermore , we show that in exciton - biexciton systems the laser characteristics such as the pulse detuning and the pulse length as well as the biexciton binding energy can be used to select the targeted quantum dot state .
