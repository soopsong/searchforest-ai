we compute the bipartite entanglement properties of the spin - half square - lattice heisenberg model by a variety of numerical techniques that include valence bond quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) , stochastic series expansion qmc , high temperature series expansions and zero temperature coupling constant expansions around the ising limit . we find that the area law is always satisfied , but in addition to the entanglement entropy per unit boundary length , there are other terms that depend logarithmically on the subregion size , arising from broken symmetry in the bulk and from the existence of corners at the boundary . we find that the numerical results are anomalous in several ways . first , the bulk term arising from broken symmetry deviates from an exact calculation that can be done for a mean - field neel state . second , the corner logs do not agree with the known results for non - interacting boson modes . and , third , even the finite temperature mutual information shows an anomalous behavior as t goes to zero , suggesting that t->0 and l->infinity limits do not commute . these calculations show that entanglement entropy demonstrates a very rich behavior in d>1 , which deserves further attention .
