quantum information technology strongly relies on coupling of optical photons with narrowband quantum systems , such as quantum dots , color centers , and atomic systems . this coupling requires matching the optical wavelength and bandwidth to the desired system , which presents a considerable problem for most available sources of quantum light . here we demonstrate coupling of alkali dipole transitions with a tunable source of photon pairs . our source is based on spontaneous parametric down - conversion in a triply - resonant whispering - gallery mode resonator . for this , we have developed novel wavelength tuning mechanisms , which allow for a coarse tuning to either cesium or rubidium wavelength with subsequent continuous fine - tuning to the desired transition . as a demonstration of the functionality of the source , we performed a heralded single photon measurement of the atomic decay . we present a major advance in controlling the spontaneous down - conversion process , which makes our bright source of single photons now compatible with a plethora of narrow - band resonant systems .
