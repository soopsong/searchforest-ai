this paper considers three variants of quantum interactive proof systems in which short ( meaning logarithmic - length ) messages are exchanged between the prover and verifier . the first variant is one in which the verifier sends a short message to the prover , and the prover responds with an ordinary , or polynomial - length , message ; the second variant is one in which any number of messages can be exchanged , but where the combined length of all the messages is logarithmic ; and the third variant is one in which the verifier sends polynomially many random bits to the prover , who responds with a short quantum message . we prove that in all of these cases the short messages can be eliminated without changing the power of the model , so the first variant has the expressive power of qma and the second and third variants have the expressive power of bqp . these facts are proved through the use of quantum state tomography , along with the finite quantum de finetti theorem for the first variant .
