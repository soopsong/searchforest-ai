we present a detailed analysis of all the algebraic conditions an arbitrary 4x4 symmetric matrix must satisfy in order to represent the correlation matrix of a two - mode bosonic system . then , we completely clarify when this arbitrary matrix can represent the correlation matrix of a separable or entangled gaussian state . in this analysis , we introduce new and alternative sets of conditions , which are expressed in terms of local symplectic invariants .
