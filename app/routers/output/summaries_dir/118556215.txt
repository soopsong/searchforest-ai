using a sub - millimetre sized yig ( yttrium iron garnet ) sphere mounted in a magnetic field - focusing cavity , we demonstrate an ultra - high cooperativity of $ 10 ^ 5 $ between magnon and photon modes at millikelvin temperatures and microwave frequencies . the cavity is designed to act as a magnetic dipole by using a novel multiple - post approach , effectively focusing the cavity magnetic field within the yig crystal with a filling factor of 3 % . coupling strength ( normal - mode splitting ) of 2 ghz , ( equivalent to 76 cavity linewidths or $ 0.3 $ hz per spin ) , is achieved for a bright cavity mode that constitutes about 10 % of the photon energy and shows that ultra - strong coupling is possible in spin systems at microwave frequencies . with straight forward optimisations we demonstrate that with that this system has the potential to reach cooperativities of $ 10 ^ 7 $ , corresponding to a normal mode splitting of 5.2 ghz and a coupling per spin approaching 1 hz . we also observe a three - mode strong coupling regime between a dark cavity mode and a magnon mode doublet pair , where the photon - magnon and magnon - magnon couplings ( normal - mode splittings ) are 143 mhz and 12.5 mhz respectively , with hwhm bandwidth of about 0.5 mhz .
