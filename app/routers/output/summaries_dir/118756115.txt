we provide a theoretical framework to study the effect of dephasing on the quantum indistinguishability of single photons emitted from a coherently driven cavity qed $ \lambda$-system . we show that with a large excited - state detuning , the photon indistinguishability can be drastically improved provided that the fluctuation rate of the noise source affecting the excited state is fast compared with the photon emission rate . in some cases a spectral filter is required to realize this improvement , but the cost in efficiency can be made small .
