we prove lower bounds on the error probability of a quantum algorithm for searching through an unordered list of n items , as a function of the number t of queries it makes . in particular , if t = o(sqrt{n } ) then the error is lower bounded by a constant . if we want error<1/2^n then we need t = omega(n ) queries . we apply this to show that a quantum computer can not do much better than a classical computer when amplifying the success probability of an rp - machine . a classical computer can achieve error<=1/2^k using k applications of the rp - machine , a quantum computer still needs at least ck applications for this ( when treating the machine as a black - box ) , where c>0 is a constant independent of k. furthermore , we prove a lower bound of omega(sqrt{log n}/loglog n ) queries for quantum bounded - error search of an ordered list of n items .
