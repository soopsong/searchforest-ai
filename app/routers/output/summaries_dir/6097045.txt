consider a symmetric quantum state on an n - fold product space , that is , the state is invariant under permutations of the n subsystems . we show that , conditioned on the outcomes of an informationally complete measurement applied to a number of subsystems , the state in the remaining subsystems is close to having product form . this immediately generalizes the so - called de finetti representation to the case of finite symmetric quantum states .
