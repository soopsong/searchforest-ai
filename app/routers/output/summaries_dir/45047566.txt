the ultimate limits of continuous - variable single - mode quantum teleportation due to absorption are studied , with special emphasis on ( quasi-)monochromatic optical fields propagating through fibers . it is shown that even if an infinitely squeezed two - mode squeezed vacuum were used , the amount of information that would be transferred quantum mechanically over a finite distance is limited and effectively approaches to zero on a length scale that is much shorter than the ( classical ) absorption length . only for short distances the state - dependent teleportation fidelity can be close to unity . to realize the largest possibly fidelity , an asymmetrical equipment must be used , where the source of the two - mode squeezed vacuum is nearer to alice than to bob and in consequence the coherent displacement performed by bob can not be chosen independently of the transmission lengths .
