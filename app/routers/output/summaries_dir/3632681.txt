in a recent remarkable experiment [ r. b. patel et al . , science advances 2 , e1501531 ( 2016 ) ] , a 3-qubit quantum fredkin ( i.e. , controlled - swap ) gate was demonstrated by using linear optics . here we propose a simple experimental scheme by utilizing the dispersive interaction in superconducting quantum circuit to implement a hybrid fredkin gate with a superconducting flux qubit as the control qubit and two separated quantum memories as the target qudits . the quantum memories considered here are prepared by the superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators or nitrogen - vacancy center ensembles . in particular , it is shown that this fredkin gate can be realized using a single - step operation and more importantly , each target qudit can be in an arbitrary state with arbitrary degrees of freedom . furthermore , we show that this experimental scheme has many potential applications in quantum computation and quantum information processing such as generating arbitrary entangled states ( discrete - variable states or continuous - variable states ) of the two memories , measuring the fidelity and the entanglement between the two memories . with state - of - the - art circuit qed technology , the numerical simulation is performed to demonstrate that two - memory noon states , entangled coherent states , and entangled cat states can be efficiently synthesized .
