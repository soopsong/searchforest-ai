we study the dynamical multistability of a solid - state single - atom laser implemented in a quantum - dot spin valve . the system is formed by a resonator that interacts with a two - level system in a dot in contact with two ferromagnetic leads of antiparallel polarization . we show that a spin - polarized current provides high - efficiency pumping leading to regimes of multistable lasing , in which the fock distribution of the oscillator displays a multi - peaked distribution . the emergence of multistable lasing follows from the breakdown of the usual rotating - wave approximation for the coherent spin - resonator interaction which occurs at relatively weak couplings . the multistability manifests itself directly in the charge current flowing through the dot , switching between distinct current levels corresponding to the different states of oscillation .
