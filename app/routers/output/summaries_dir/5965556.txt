we develop a general framework of evaluating the gain coefficient of stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) in optical waveguides via the overlap integral between optical and elastic eigen - modes . we show that spatial symmetry of the optical force dictates the selection rules of the excitable elastic modes . by applying this method to a rectangular silicon waveguide , we demonstrate the spatial distributions of optical force and elastic eigen - modes jointly determine the magnitude and scaling of sbs gain coefficient in both forward and backward sbs processes . we further apply this method to inter - modal sbs process , and demonstrate that the coupling between distinct optical modes are necessary to excite elastic modes with all possible symmetries .
