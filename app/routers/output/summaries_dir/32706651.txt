quantum walks , both discrete ( coined ) and continuous time , form the basis of several recent quantum algorithms . here we use numerical simulations to study the properties of discrete , coined quantum walks . we investigate the variation in the entanglement between the coin and the position of the particle by calculating the entropy of the reduced density matrix of the coin . we consider both dynamical evolution and asymptotic limits for coins of dimensions from two to eight on regular graphs . for low coin dimensions , quantum walks which spread faster ( as measured by the mean square deviation of their distribution from uniform ) also exhibit faster convergence towards the asymptotic value of the entanglement between the coin and particle 's position . for high - dimensional coins , the dft coin operator is more efficient at spreading than the grover coin . we study the entanglement of the coin on regular finite graphs such as cycles , and also show that on complete bipartite graphs , a quantum walk with a grover coin is always periodic with period four . we generalize the ' glued trees ' graph used by childs et al ( 2003 proc . stoc , pp 5968 ) to higher branching rate ( fan out ) and verify that the scaling with branching rate and with tree depth is polynomial .
