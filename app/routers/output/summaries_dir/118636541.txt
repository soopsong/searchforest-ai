we investigate how the entanglement characteristics of a non - gaussian entangled state are increased or decreased by a local photon subtraction operation . the non - gaussian entangled state is generated by injecting a single - mode non - gaussian state and a vacuum state into a 50:50 beam splitter . we consider a photon - added coherent state and an odd coherent state as a single - mode non - gaussian state . in the regime of small amplitude , we show that the performance of quantum teleportation and the second - order einstein - podolsky- rosen - type correlation can both be enhanced , whereas the degree of entanglement decreases , for the output state when a local photon subtraction operation is applied to the non - gaussian entangled state . the counterintuitive effect is more prominent in the limit of nearly zero amplitude .
