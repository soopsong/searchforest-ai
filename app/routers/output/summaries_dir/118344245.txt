we present a way for entanglement purification based on two parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) sources with cross - kerr nonlinearities . it is comprised of two processes . the first one is a primary entanglement purification protocol for pdc sources with nondestructive quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) detectors by transferring the spatial entanglement of photon pairs to their polarization . in this time , the qnd detectors act as the role of controlled - not ( cnot ) gates . also they can distinguish the photon number of the spatial modes , which provides a good way for the next process to purify the entanglement of the photon pairs kept more . in the second process for entanglement purification , new qnd detectors are designed to act as the role of cnot gates . this protocol has the advantage of high yield and it requires neither cnot gates based on linear optical elements nor sophisticated single - photon detectors , which makes it more convenient in practical applications .
