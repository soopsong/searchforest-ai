we investigate collective nonlinear dynamics in a blue - detuned optomechanical cavity that is mechanically coupled to an undriven mechanical resonator . by controlling the strength of the driving field , we engineer a mechanical gain that balances the losses of the undriven resonator . this gain - loss balance corresponds to the threshold where both coupled mechanical resonators enter simultaneously into self - sustained limit cycle oscillations regime . rich sets of collective dynamics such as in - phase and out - of - phase synchronizations therefore emerge , depending on the mechanical coupling rate , the optically induced mechanical gain and spring effect , and the frequency mismatch between the resonators . moreover , we introduce the quadratic coupling that induces enhancement of the in - phase synchronization . this work shows how phonon transport can remotely induce synchronization in coupled mechanical resonator array and opens up new avenues for metrology , communication , phonon - processing , and novel memories concepts .
