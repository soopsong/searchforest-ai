the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model describes particles on a ring interacting via a cosine interaction , or equivalently , rotors coupled by infinite - range xy interactions . conceived as a generic statistical mechanical model for long - range interactions such as gravity ( of which the cosine is the first fourier component ) , it has recently been used to account for self - organization in experiments on cold atoms with long - range optically mediated interactions . the significance of the hmf model lies in its ability to capture the universal effects of long - range interactions and yet be exactly solvable in the canonical ensemble . in this work we consider the quantum version of the hmf model in 1d and provide a classification of all possible stationary solutions of its generalized gross - pitaevskii equation ( ggpe ) which is both nonlinear and nonlocal . the exact solutions are mathieu functions that obey a nonlinear relation between the wavefunction and the depth of the meanfield potential , and we identify them as bright solitons . using a galilean transformation these solutions can be boosted to finite velocity and are increasingly localized as the meanfield potential becomes deeper . in contrast to the usual local gpe , the hmf case features a tower of solitons , each with a different number of nodes . our results suggest that long - range interactions support solitary waves in a novel manner relative to the short - range case .
