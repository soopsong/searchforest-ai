continuous - variable quantum - computing ( cvqc ) is the most scalable implementation of qc to date but requires non - gaussian resources to allow exponential speedup and quantum correction , using error encoding such as gottesman - kitaev - preskill ( gkp ) states . however , gkp state generation is still an experimental challenge . we show theoretically that photon catalysis , the interference of coherent states with single - photon states followed by photon - number - resolved detection , is a powerful enabler for non - gaussian quantum state engineering such as exactly displaced single - photon states and $ m$-symmetric superpositions of squeezed vacuum ( ssv ) , including squeezed cat states ( $ m=2 $ ) . by including photon - counting based state breeding , we demonstrate the potential to enlarge ssv states and produce gkp states .
