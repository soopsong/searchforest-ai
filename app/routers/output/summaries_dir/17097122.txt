the paper studies the excitability properties of a generalized fitzhugh - nagumo model . the model differs from the purely competitive fitzhugh - nagumo model in that it accounts for the effect of cooperative gating variables such as activation of calcium currents . excitability is explored by unfolding a pitchfork bifurcation that is shown to organize five different types of excitability . in addition to the three classical types of neuronal excitability , two novel types are described and distinctly associated to the presence of cooperative variables .
