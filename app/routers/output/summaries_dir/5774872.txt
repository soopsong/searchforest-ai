avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) are a practical option for space - based quantum communications requiring single - photon detection . however , radiation damage to apds significantly increases their dark count rates and reduces their useful lifetimes in orbit . we show that high - power laser annealing of irradiated apds of three different models ( excelitas c30902sh , excelitas slik , and laser components sap500s2 ) heals the radiation damage and substantially restores low dark count rates . of nine samples , the maximum dark count rate reduction factor varies between 5.3 and 758 when operating at minus 80 degrees celsius . the illumination power to reach these reduction factors ranges from 0.8 to 1.6 w. other photon detection characteristics , such as photon detection efficiency , timing jitter , and afterpulsing probability , remain mostly unaffected . these results herald a promising method to extend the lifetime of a quantum satellite equipped with apds .
