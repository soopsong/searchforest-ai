a novel universal and fault - tolerant basis ( set of gates ) for quantum computation is described . such a set is necessary to perform quantum computation in a realistic noisy environment . the new basis consists of two single - qubit gates ( hadamard and $ { \sigma_z}^{1/4}$ ) , and one double - qubit gate ( controlled - not ) . since the set consisting of controlled - not and hadamard gates is not universal , the new basis achieves universality by including only one additional elementary ( in the sense that it does not include angles that are irrational multiples of $ \pi$ ) single - qubit gate , and hence , is potentially the simplest universal basis that one can construct . we also provide an alternative proof of universality for the only other known class of universal and fault - tolerant basis proposed by shor and by kitaev .
