with a perturbative treatment based on the keldysh green 's function technique , we study the resonant enhancement of nonlinear interaction effects in a four - mode optomechanical ring . in such a system , we identify five distinct types of resonant scattering between unperturbed polariton modes , induced by the nonlinear optomechanical interaction . by computing the cavity density of states and optomechanical induced transparency signal , we find that the largest nonlinear effects are induced by a decay process involving the two phonon - like polaritons . in contrast to the conventional two - mode optomechanical system , our proposed system can exhibit prominent nonlinear features even in the regime when the single - photon coupling is much smaller than the cavity damping .
