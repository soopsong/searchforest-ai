we define a discrete - time , coined quantum walk on weighted graphs that is inspired by szegedy 's quantum walk . using this , we prove that many lackadaisical quantum walks , where each vertex has $ l$ integer self - loops , can be generalized to a quantum walk where each vertex has a single self - loop of real - valued weight $ l$. we apply this real - valued lackadaisical quantum walk to two problems . first , we analyze it on the line or one - dimensional lattice , showing that it is exactly equivalent to a continuous deformation of the three - state grover walk with faster ballistic dispersion . second , we generalize grover 's algorithm , or search on the complete graph , to have a weighted self - loop at each vertex , yielding an improved success probability when $ l<3 + 2\sqrt{2 } \approx 5.828$.
