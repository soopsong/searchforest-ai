quantum random walks are shown to have non - intuitive dynamics , which makes them an attractive area of study for devising quantum algorithms for well - known classical problems as well as those arising in the field of quantum computing . in this work we propose a novel scheme for the physical implementation of a discrete - time quantum random walk using laser excitations of the electronic states of an array of quantum dots . these dots represent the discrete nodes of the walk , while transitions between the energy levels inside each dot correspond to the required coin operation and stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) processes are employed to induce the steps of the walk . the quantum dot design is tailored in such a way as to enable selective coupling of the energy levels . our simulation results show a close agreement with the ideal quantum walk distribution as well as modest robustness towards noise disturbance .
