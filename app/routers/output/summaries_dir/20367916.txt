schemes for topological quantum computation are usually based on the assumption that the system is initially prepared in a specific state . in practice , this state preparation is expected to be challenging as it involves non - topological operations which heavily depend on the experimental realization and are not naturally robust against noise . here we show that this assumption can be relaxed by using composite anyons : starting from an unknown state with reasonable physical properties , it is possible to efficiently distill suitable initial states for computation purely by braiding . this is achieved by encoding logical information in a subsystem code with gauge system corresponding to the internal degrees of freedom of composite objects .
