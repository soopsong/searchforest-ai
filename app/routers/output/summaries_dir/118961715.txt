we study analytically the dynamic behaviors of quantum correlation measured by quantum discord between two uncoupled qubits , which are immersed in a common ohmic environment . we show that the quantum discord of the two noninteracting qubits can be greatly amplified or protected for certain initially prepared $ x$-type states in the time evolution . especially , it is found that there does exist the stable amplification of the quantum discord for the case of two identical qubits , and the quantum discord can be protected for the case of two different qubits with a large detuning . it is also indicated that in general there does exist a sudden change of the quantum discord in the time evolution at a critic time point $ t_c$ , and the discord amplification and protection may occur only in the time interval $ 0 < t\leq t_c$ for certain $ x$-type states . this sheds new light on the creation and protection of quantum correlation .
