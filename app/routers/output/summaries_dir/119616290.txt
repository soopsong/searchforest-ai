given the extensive application of classical random walks to classical algorithms in a variety of fields , their quantum analogue in quantum walks is expected to provide a fruitful source of quantum algorithms . so far , however , such algorithms have been scarce . in this work , we enumerate some important differences between quantum and classical walks , leading to their markedly different properties . we show that for many practical purposes , the implementation of quantum walks can be efficiently achieved using a classical computer . we then develop both classical and quantum graph isomorphism algorithms based on discrete - time quantum walks . we show that they are effective in identifying isomorphism classes of large databases of graphs , in particular groups of strongly regular graphs . we consider this approach to represent a promising candidate for an efficient solution to the graph isomorphism problem , and believe that similar methods employing quantum walks , or derivatives of these walks , may prove beneficial in constructing other algorithms for a variety of purposes .
