we study the reachability problem of a quantum system modelled by a quantum automaton . the reachable sets are chosen to be boolean combinations of ( closed ) subspaces of the state space of the quantum system . four different reachability properties are considered : eventually reachable , globally reachable , ultimately forever reachable , and infinitely often reachable . the main result of this paper is that all of the four reachability properties are undecidable in general ; however , the last three become decidable if the reachable sets are boolean combinations without negation .
