entanglement between two quantum systems is a resource in quantum information , but dissipation usually destroys it . in this article we consider two qubits without direct interaction and we show that , even in cases where the open system dynamics destroys any initial entanglement , the mere monitoring of the environment can preserve or create the entanglement , by filtering the state of the qubits . while the systems we study are very simple , we can show examples with entanglement protection or entanglement birth , death , rebirth due to monitoring .
