the study of quantum circuits composed of commuting gates is particularly useful to understand the delicate boundary between quantum and classical computation . indeed , while being a restricted class , commuting circuits exhibit genuine quantum effects such as entanglement . in this paper we show that the computational power of commuting circuits exhibits a surprisingly rich structure . first we show that every 2-local commuting circuit acting on d - level systems and followed by single - qudit measurements can be efficiently simulated classically with high accuracy . in contrast , we prove that such strong simulations are hard for 3-local circuits . using sampling methods we further show that all commuting circuits composed of exponentiated pauli operators e^{i\theta p } can be simulated efficiently classically when followed by single - qubit measurements . finally , we show that commuting circuits can efficiently simulate certain non - commutative processes , related in particular to constant - depth quantum circuits . this gives evidence that the power of commuting circuits goes beyond classical computation .
