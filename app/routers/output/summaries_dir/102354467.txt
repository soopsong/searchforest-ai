in this paper , we study dynamical quantum networks which evolve according to schr\"odinger equations but subject to sequential local or global quantum measurements . a network of qubits forms a composite quantum system whose state undergoes unitary evolution in between periodic measurements , leading to hybrid quantum dynamics with random jumps at discrete time instances along a continuous orbit . the measurements either act on the entire network of qubits , or only a subset of qubits . first of all , we reveal that this type of hybrid quantum dynamics induces probabilistic boolean recursions representing the measurement outcomes . with global measurements , it is shown that such resulting boolean recursions define markov chains whose state - transitions are fully determined by the network hamiltonian and the measurement observables . particularly , we establish an explicit and algebraic representation of the underlying recursive random mapping driving such induced markov chains . next , with local measurements , the resulting probabilistic boolean dynamics is shown to be no longer markovian . the state transition probability at any given time becomes dependent on the entire history of the sample path , for which we establish a recursive way of computing such non - markovian probability transitions . finally , we adopt the classical bilinear control model for the continuous schr\"odinger evolution , and show how the measurements affect the controllability of the quantum networks .
