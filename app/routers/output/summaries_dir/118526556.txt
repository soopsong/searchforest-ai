quantum tunneling is a phenomenon in which a quantum state traverses energy barriers above the energy of the state itself . tunneling has been hypothesized as an advantageous physical resource for optimization . here we present the first experimental evidence of a computational role of multiqubit quantum tunneling in the evolution of a programmable quantum annealer . we develop a theoretical model based on a niba quantum master equation to describe the multiqubit dissipative tunneling effects under the complex noise characteristics of such quantum devices . we start by considering a computational primitive , an optimization problem consisting of just one global and one false minimum . the quantum evolutions enable tunneling to the global minimum while the corresponding classical paths are trapped in a false minimum . in our study the non - convex potentials are realized by frustrated networks of qubit clusters with strong intra - cluster coupling . we show that the collective effect of the quantum environment is suppressed in the"critical"phase during the evolution where quantum tunneling"decides"the right path to solution . in a later stage dissipation facilitates the multiqubit tunneling leading to the solution state . the predictions of the model accurately describe the experimental data from the d - wave two quantum annealer at nasa ames . in our computational primitive the temperature dependence of the probability of success in the quantum model is opposite to that of the classical paths with thermal hopping . specifically , we provide an analysis of an optimization problem with sixteen qubits , demonstrating eight qubit tunneling that increases success probabilities . furthermore , we report results for larger problems with up to 200 qubits that contain the primitive as subproblems .
