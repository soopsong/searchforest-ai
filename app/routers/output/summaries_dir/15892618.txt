in this note we present a operator formulation of gauge theories in a quantum phase space which is specified by a operator algebra . for simplicity we work with the heisenberg algebra . we introduce the notion of the derivative ( transport ) and wilson line ( parallel transport ) which enables us to construct a gauge theory in a simple way . we illustrate the formulation by a discussion of the higgs mechanism and comment on the large n masterfield .
