a quantum key distribution scheme based on the use of displaced squeezed vacuum states is presented . the states are squeezed in one of two field quadrature components , and the value of the squeezed component is used to encode a character from an alphabet . the uncertainty relation between quadrature components prevents an eavesdropper from determining both with enough precision to determine the character being sent . losses degrade the performance of this scheme , but it is possible to use phase - sensitive amplifiers to boost the signal and partially compensate for their effect .
