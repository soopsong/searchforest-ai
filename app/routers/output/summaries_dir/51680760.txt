cavity - assisted spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) and spontaneous four - wave mixing ( sfwm ) in nonlinear optical materials are practical and versatile methods to generate narrowband time - energy entangled photon pairs . time - energy entangled photons with tailored spectro - temporal properties are particularly useful for efficient quantum optical interfaces . in this work we study the generation of photon pairs in cavity - assisted spdc and sfwm for the general case of off - resonant conversion , namely , when the frequencies of the generated photons do not match the cavity resonances . such a frequency mismatch in particular depends on temperature and requires an additional control in the experiment . first , we propose a generic model , for description of cavity - assisted spdc and sfwm . we show that in both processes the mismatch reduces the generation rate of photons , distorts the spectrum and the auto - correlation function of the generated fields , as well as affects the photon generation dynamics . second , we verify the results experimentally using parametric generation of photon pairs in a nonlinear whispering gallery mode resonator ( wgmr ) as an experimental platform with controlled frequency mismatch . our work reveals the role of the frequency mismatch in the photon generation process and shows a way to control it . obtained results constitute one more step in the direction of full control over the spectro - temporal properties of entangled photon pairs and the heralded generation of single - photon pulses with a tailored temporal mode .
