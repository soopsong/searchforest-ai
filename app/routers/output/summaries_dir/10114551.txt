photonic - crystal - based integrated optical systems have been used for a broad range of sensing applications with great success . this has been motivated by several advantages such as high sensitivity , miniaturization , remote sensing , selectivity and stability . many photonic crystal sensors have been proposed with various fabrication designs that result in improved optical properties . in parallel , integrated optical systems are being pursued as a platform for photonic quantum information processing using linear optics and fock states . here we propose a novel integrated fock state optical sensor architecture that can be used for force , refractive index and possibly local temperature detection . in this scheme , two coupled cavities behave as an"effective beam splitter " . the sensor works based on fourth order interference ( the hong - ou - mandel effect ) and requires a sequence of single photon pulses and consequently has low pulse power . changes in the parameter to be measured induce variations in the effective beam splitter reflectivity and result in changes to the visibility of interference . we demonstrate this generic scheme in coupled l3 photonic crystal cavities as an example and find that this system , which only relies on photon coincidence detection and does not need any spectral resolution , can estimate forces as small as $ 10^{-7}$ newtons and can measure one part per million change in refractive index using a very low input power of $ 10^{-10}$w . thus linear optical quantum photonic architectures can achieve comparable sensor performance to semiclassical devices .
