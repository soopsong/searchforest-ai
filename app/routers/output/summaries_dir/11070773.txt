we consider communication between two parties using a bipartite quantum operation , which constitutes the most general quantum mechanical model of two - party communication . we primarily focus on the simultaneous forward and backward communication of classical messages . for the case in which the two parties share unlimited prior entanglement , we give inner and outer bounds on the achievable rate region that generalize classical results due to shannon . in particular , using a protocol of bennett , harrow , leung , and smolin , we give a one - shot expression in terms of the holevo information for the entanglement - assisted one - way capacity of a two - way quantum channel . as applications , we rederive two known additivity results for one - way channel capacities : the entanglement - assisted capacity of a general one - way channel , and the unassisted capacity of an entanglement - breaking one - way channel .
