we investigate the relationship between the gap between the energy of the ground state and the first excited state and the decay of correlation functions in harmonic lattice systems . we prove that in gapped systems , the exponential decay of correlations follows for both the ground state and thermal states . considering the converse direction , we show that an energy gap can follow from algebraic decay and always does for exponential decay . the underlying lattices are described as general graphs of not necessarily integer dimension , including translationally invariant instances of cubic lattices as special cases . any local quadratic couplings in position and momentum coordinates are allowed for , leading to quasi - free ( gaussian ) ground states . we make use of methods of deriving bounds to matrix functions of banded matrices corresponding to local interactions on general graphs . finally , we give an explicit entanglement - area relationship in terms of the energy gap for arbitrary , not necessarily contiguous regions on lattices characterized by general graphs .
