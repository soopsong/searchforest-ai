in network science , graphs obtained by taking the kronecker or tensor power of the adjacency matrix of an initiator graph are used to construct complex networks . in this paper , we analytically prove sufficient conditions under which such kronecker graphs can be searched by a continuous - time quantum walk in optimal $ \theta(\sqrt{n})$ time . first , if the initiator is regular and its adjacency matrix has a dominant principal eigenvalue , meaning its unique largest eigenvalue asymptotically dominates the other eigenvalues in magnitude , then the kronecker graphs generated by this initiator can be quantum searched with probability 1 in $ \pi\sqrt{n}/2 $ time , asymptotically , and we give the critical jumping rate of the walk that enables this . second , for any fixed initiator that is regular , non - bipartite , and connected , the kronecker graphs generated by it are quantum searched in $ \theta(\sqrt{n})$ time . this greatly extends the number of kronecker graphs on which quantum walks are known to optimally search . if the fixed , regular , connected initiator is bipartite , however , then search on its kronecker powers is not optimal , but is still better than classical computer 's $ o(n)$ runtime if the initiator has more than two vertices .
