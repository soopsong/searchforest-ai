in this work , we propose an optimization approach for constructing various classes of circulant combinatorial designs that can be defined in terms of autocorrelations . the problem is formulated as a so - called feasibility problem having three sets , to which the douglas - rachford projection algorithm is applied . the approach is illustrated on three different classes of circulant combinatorial designs : circulant weighing matrices , d - optimal matrices , and hadamard matrices with two circulant cores . furthermore , we explicitly construct two new circulant weighing matrices , a $ cw(126,64)$ and a $ cw(198,100)$ , whose existence was previously marked as unresolved in the most recent version of strassler 's table .
