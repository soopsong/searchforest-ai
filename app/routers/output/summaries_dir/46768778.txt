quantum frequency conversion ( qfc ) in nonlinear optical media is a powerful tool for temporal - mode selective manipulation of light . recent attempts at achieving high mode selectivities and/or fidelities have had to resort to multi - dimensional optimization schemes to determine the system 's natural schmidt modes . certain combinations of relative - group velocities between the relevant frequency bands , medium length , and temporal pulse widths have been known to achieve good selectivities ( exceeding 80 % ) for temporal modes that are nearly identical to pump pulse shapes , even for high conversion efficiencies . working in this parameter regime using an off - the - shelf , second - harmonic generation , mgo : ppln waveguide , and with pulses on the order of 500 fs at wavelengths around 800 nm , we verify experimentally that model - predicted schmidt modes provide the high temporal - mode selectivity expected . this paves the way to the implementation of a proposed two - stage qfc scheme that is predicted to reach near - perfect ( 100 % ) selectivity .
