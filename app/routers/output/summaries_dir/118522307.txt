we propose the use of weakly nonlinear passive materials for prospective applications in integrated quantum photonics . it is shown that strong enhancement of native optical nonlinearities by electromagnetic field confinement in photonic crystal resonators can lead to single - photon generation only exploiting the quantum interference of two coupled modes and the effect of photon blockade under resonant coherent driving . for realistic system parameters in state of the art microcavities , the efficiency of such single - photon source is theoretically characterized by means of the second - order correlation function at zero time delay as the main figure of merit , where major sources of loss and decoherence are taken into account within a standard master equation treatment . these results could stimulate the realization of integrated quantum photonic devices based on non - resonant material media , fully integrable with current semiconductor technology and matching the relevant telecom band operational wavelengths , as an alternative to single - photon nonlinear devices based on cavity - qed with artificial atoms or single atomic - like emitters .
