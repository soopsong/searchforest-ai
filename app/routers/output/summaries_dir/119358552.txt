the gravastar picture is an alternative model to the concept of a black hole , where there is an effective phase transition at or near where the event horizon is expected to form , and the interior is replaced by a de sitter condensate . in this work , a generalization of the gravastar picture is explored , by considering a matching of an interior solution governed by the dark energy equation of state , $ \omega\equiv p/ \rho<-1/3 $ , to an exterior schwarzschild vacuum solution at a junction interface . the motivation for implementing this generalization arises from the fact that recent observations have confirmed an accelerated cosmic expansion , for which dark energy is a possible candidate . several relativistic dark energy stellar configurations are analyzed by imposing specific choices for the mass function . the first case considered is that of a constant energy density , and the second choice , that of a monotonic decreasing energy density in the star 's interior . the dynamical stability of the transition layer of these dark energy stars to linearized spherically symmetric radial perturbations about static equilibrium solutions is also explored . it is found that large stability regions exist that are sufficiently close to where the event horizon is expected to form , so that it would be difficult to distinguish the exterior geometry of the dark energy stars , analyzed in this work , from an astrophysical black hole .
