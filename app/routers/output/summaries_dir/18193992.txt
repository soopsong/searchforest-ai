toeplitz matrices have applications to different problems of statistical mechanics . recently they were used for calculation of entanglement entropy in spin chains . we use the fisher - hartwig formula to calculate entanglement entropy of large block of spins in the ground state of xy spin chain . we also calculate renyi entropy and prove that the spectrum of the density matrix of a block of spins is exact geometric sequence [ also different eigenvalues are degenerated differently ] .
