we propose an experimental design for universal continuous - variable quantum computation that incorporates recent innovations in linear - optics - based continuous - variable cluster state generation and cubic - phase gate teleportation . the first ingredient is a protocol for generating the bilayer - square - lattice cluster state ( a universal resource state ) with temporal modes of light . with this state , measurement - based implementation of gaussian unitary gates requires only homodyne detection . second , we describe a measurement device that implements an adaptive cubic - phase gate , up to a random phase - space displacement . it requires a two - step sequence of homodyne measurements and consumes a ( non - gaussian ) cubic - phase state .
