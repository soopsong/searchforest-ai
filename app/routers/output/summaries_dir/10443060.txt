it has recently become fashionable to regard black holes as elementary particles . by taking this suggestion seriously it is possible to cobble together an elementary particle physics based estimate for the decay rate $ ( \hbox{black hole})_i \to ( \hbox{black hole})_f + ( \hbox{massless quantum})$. this estimate of the spontaneous emission rate contains two free parameters which may be fixed by demanding that the high energy end of the spectrum of emitted quanta match a blackbody spectrum at the hawking temperature . the calculation , though technically trivial , has important conceptual implications : ( 1 ) the existence of hawking radiation from black holes is ultimately dependent only on the fact that massless quanta ( and all other forms of matter ) couple to gravity . ( 2 ) the thermal nature of the hawking spectrum depends only on the fact that the number of internal states of a large mass black hole is enormous . ( 3 ) remarkably , the resulting formula for the decay rate gives meaningful answers even when extrapolated to low mass black holes . the analysis strongly supports the scenario of complete evaporation as the endpoint of the hawking radiation process ( no naked singularity , no stable massive remnant ) .
