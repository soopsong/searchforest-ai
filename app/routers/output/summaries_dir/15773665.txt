lithium niobate photonic circuits have the salutary property of permitting the generation , transmission , and processing of photons to be accommodated on a single chip . compact photonic circuits such as these , with multiple components integrated on a single chip , are crucial for efficiently implementing quantum information processing schemes . we present a set of basic transformations that are useful for manipulating modal qubits in ti : linbo$_3 $ photonic quantum circuits . these include the mode analyzer , a device that separates the even and odd components of a state into two separate spatial paths ; the mode rotator , which rotates the state by an angle in mode space ; and modal pauli spin operators that effect related operations . we also describe the design of a deterministic , two - qubit , single - photon , cnot gate , a key element in certain sets of universal quantum logic gates . it is implemented as a ti : linbo$_3 $ photonic quantum circuit in which the polarization and mode number of a single photon serve as the control and target qubits , respectively . it is shown that the effects of dispersion in the cnot circuit can be mitigated by augmenting it with an additional path . the performance of all of these components are confirmed by numerical simulations . the implementation of these transformations relies on selective and controllable power coupling among single- and two - mode waveguides , as well as the polarization sensitivity of the pockels coefficients in linbo$_3$.
