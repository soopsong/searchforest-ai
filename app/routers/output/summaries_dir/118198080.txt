an important topic of interest in imaging is the construction of protocols that are not diffraction limited . this can be achieved in a variety of ways , including classical superresolution techniques or quantum entanglement - based protocols . here , we consider superresolving imaging in the far field using higher - order intensity correlations . we show that third and fourth order correlations can improve upon the first and second order correlations that are traditionally used in classical optics and hanbury brown and twiss type experiments . the improvement is achieved entirely by post - processing of the data . as a demonstrator , we simulate the far field intensity distribution of a circular aperture that emits thermal light and use maximum likelihood estimation to determine the radius of the aperture . we compare the achieved precision to the cram\'er - rao lower bound and find that the variance of measurements for the third and fourth order correlation functions are indeed closer to the cram\'er - rao bound than that of the second order correlation function . the method presented here is general , and can be used for all kinds of incoherent emitters , geometries , and types of noise .
