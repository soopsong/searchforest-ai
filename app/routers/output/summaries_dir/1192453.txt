the state matrix $ \rho$ for an open quantum system with markovian evolution obeys a master equation . the master equation evolution can be unraveled into stochastic nonlinear trajectories for a pure state $ p$ , such that on average $ p$ reproduces $ \rho$. here we give for the first time a complete parameterization of all diffusive unravelings ( in which $ p$ evolves continuously but non - differentiably in time ) . we give an explicit measurement theory interpretation for these quantum trajectories , in terms of monitoring the system 's environment . we also introduce new classes of diffusive unravelings that are invariant under the linear operator transformations under which the master equation is invariant . we illustrate these invariant unravelings by numerical simulations . finally , we discuss generalized gauge transformations as a method of connecting apparently disparate descriptions of the same trajectories by stochastic schr\"odinger equations , and their invariance properties .
