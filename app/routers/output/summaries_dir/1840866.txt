we present a numerical method for the approximation of solutions for the class of stochastic differential equations driven by brownian motions which induce stochastic variation in fixed directions . this class of equations arises naturally in the study of population processes and chemical reaction kinetics . we show that the method constructs paths that are second order accurate in the weak sense . the method is simpler than many second order methods in that it neither requires the construction of iterated ito integrals nor the evaluation of any derivatives . the method consists of two steps . in the first an explicit euler step is used to take a fractional step . this fractional point is then combined with the initial point to obtain a higher order , trapezoidal like , approximation . the higher order of accuracy stems from the fact that both the drift and the quadratic variation of the underlying sde are approximated to second order .
