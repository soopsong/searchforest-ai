we present a protocol for generating on - demand , indistinguishable single photons on a silicon photonic integrated chip . the source is a time - multiplexed spontaneous parametric down - conversion element that allows optimization of single - photon versus multiphoton emission while realizing high output rate and indistinguishability . we minimize both the scaling of active elements and the scaling of active element loss with multiplexing . we then discuss detection strategies and data processing to further optimize the procedure . we simulate an improvement in single - photon - generation efficiency over previous time - multiplexing protocols , assuming existing fabrication capabilities . we then apply this system to generate heralded bell states . the generation efficiency of both nonclassical states could be increased substantially with improved fabrication procedures .
