with photons being the only available candidates for long - distance quantum communication , most quantum cryptographic devices are physically realized as optical systems that operate a security protocol based on the laws of quantum mechanics . but to finally yield a stream of bits ( secret key ) usable for encryption , a quantum - to - classical transition is required . synchronization of electronic&optoelectronic components involved in such tasks thus becomes a necessary and important step . however , it also opens up the possibility of timing - based loopholes and attacks .
