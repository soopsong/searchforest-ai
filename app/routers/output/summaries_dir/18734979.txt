attention to the very physical aspects of information characterizes the current research in quantum computation , quantum cryptography and quantum communication . in most of the cases quantum description of the system provides advantages over the classical approach . game theory , the study of decision making in conflict situation has already been extended to the quantum domain . we would like to review the latest development in quantum game theory that is relevant to information processing . we will begin by illustrating the general idea of a quantum game and methods of gaining an advantage over"classical opponent " . then we review the most important game theoretical aspects of quantum information processing . on grounds of the discussed material , we reason about possible future development of quantum game theory and its impact on information processing and the emerging information society . the idea of quantum artificial intelligence is explained .
