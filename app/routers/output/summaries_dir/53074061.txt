we study the estimation of an infinitesimal rotation of a spin - j system , characterized by two unknown phases , and compare the estimation precision achievable with two different strategies . the first is a standard ` joint estimation ' strategy , in which a single probe state is used to estimate both parameters , while the second is a ` sequential ' strategy in which the two phases are estimated separately , each on half of the total number of system copies . in the limit of small angles we show that , although the joint estimation approach yields in general a better performance , the two strategies possess the same scaling of the total phase sensitivity with respect to the spin number j , namely $ \delta\phi \simeq 1 / j$. finally , we discuss a simple estimation strategy based on spin squeezed states and spin measurements , and compare its performance with the ultimate limits to the estimation precision that we have derived above .
