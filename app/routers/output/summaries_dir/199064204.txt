gravitational waves are a sensitive probe into the structure of compact astronomical objects and the nature of gravity in the strong regime . modifications of near - horizon physics can imprint on the late time ringdown waveform , leaving behind a train of echoes , from which useful information about new physics in the strong gravity regime can be extracted . we propose a novel approach to compute the ringdown waveform and characterize individual echoes perturbatively using the fredholm determinants , which can be intuitively represented via a diagrammatical scheme . direct non - perturbative treatments can also be easily implemented for some cases . numerically , the method is also effective and accurate even for relatively low resources .
