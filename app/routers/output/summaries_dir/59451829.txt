machine learning representations of many - body quantum states have recently been introduced as an ansatz to describe the ground states and unitary evolutions of many - body quantum systems . we explore one of the most important representations , restricted boltzmann machine ( rbm ) representation , in stabilizer formalism . we give the general method of constructing rbm representation for stabilizer code states and find the exact rbm representation for several types of stabilizer groups with the number of hidden neurons equal or less than the number of visible neurons , which indicates that the representation is extremely efficient . then we analyze the surface code with boundaries , defects , domain walls and twists in full detail and find that all the models can be efficiently represented via rbm ansatz states . besides , the case for kitaev 's $ d(\zb_d)$ model , which is a generalized model of surface code , is also investigated .
