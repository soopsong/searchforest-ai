in this work , we discuss connections between different theoretical physics communities and their works , all related to systems that act as sources of particles such as photons , phonons , or electrons . our interest is to understand how a low - dimensional quantum system driven by coherent fields , e.g. a two - level system , jaynes - cummings system , or photon pair source driven by a laser pulse , emits photons into a waveguide . of particular relevance to solid - state sources is that we provide a way to include dissipation into the formalism for temporal - mode quantum optics . we will discuss the connections between temporal - mode quantum optics , scattering matrices , quantum stochastic calculus , continuous matrix product states and operators , and very traditional quantum optical concepts such as the mandel photon counting formula and the lindblad form of the quantum - optical master equation . we close with an example of how our formalism relates to single - photon sources with dephasing .
