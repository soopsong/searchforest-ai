driven by single photon detection requirements especially for quantum information sciences , the theory of arrays of off - on detectors has been well developed and applied . however for a comprehensive characterization of nonclassicality one also needs phase sensitive properties . this missing link is fulfilled by the theory of phase sensitive click counting measurements . this theory is presented . it unifies the balanced homodyne detection for high intensities with the click detection in the few photon regime . we formulate and apply a hierarchy of nonlinear squeezing conditions to probe quantum effects beyond standard squeezing . imperfections stemming from fluctuations of the local oscillator , detector efficiency , and dark count rates are considered . experimentally accessible sampling formulas are given which can be applied without time consuming data processing . our phase - sensitive click detection theory paves the way towards novel applications of nonclassical light in quantum metrology .
