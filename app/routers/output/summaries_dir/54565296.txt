genuine high - dimensional entanglement , i.e. the property of having a high schmidt number , constitutes a resource in quantum communication , overcoming limitations of low - dimensional systems . states with a positive partial transpose ( ppt ) , on the other hand , are generally considered weakly entangled , as they can never be distilled into pure entangled states . this naturally raises the question , whether high schmidt numbers are possible for ppt states . volume estimates suggest that optimal , i.e. linear , scaling in local dimension should be possible , albeit without providing an insight into the possible slope . we provide the first explicit construction of a family of ppt states that achieves linear scaling in local dimension and we prove that random ppt states typically share this feature . our construction also allows us to answer a recent question by chen et al . on the existence of ppt states whose schmidt number increases by an arbitrarily large amount upon partial transposition . finally , we link the schmidt number to entangled sub - block matrices of a quantum state . we use this connection to prove that quantum states invariant under partial transposition on the smaller of their two subsystems can not have maximal schmidt number . this generalizes a well - known result by kraus et al . we also show that the schmidt number of absolutely ppt states can not be maximal , contributing to an open problem in entanglement theory .
