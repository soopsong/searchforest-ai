we report a non - trivial feature of the vacuum structure of free massive or massless dirac fields in the hyperbolic de sitter spacetime . here we have two causally disconnected regions , say $ r$ and $ l$ separated by another region , $ c$. we are interested in the field theory in $ r\cup l$ to understand the long range quantum correlations between $ r$ and $ l$. there are local modes of the dirac field having supports individually either in $ r$ or $ l$ , as well as global modes found via analytically continuing the $ r$ modes to $ l$ and vice versa . however , we show that unlike the case of a scalar field , the analytic continuation does not preserve the orthogonality of the resulting global modes . accordingly , we need to orthonormalise them following the gram - schmidt prescription , prior to the field quantisation in order to preserve the canonical anti - commutation relations . we observe that this prescription naturally incorporates a spacetime independent continuous parameter , $ \theta_{\rm rl}$ , into the picture . thus interestingly , we obtain a naturally emerging one - parameter family of $ \alpha$-like de sitter vacua . the values of $ \theta_{\rm rl}$ yielding the usual thermal spectra of massless created particles are pointed out . next , using these vacua , we investigate both entanglement and r\'enyi entropies of either of the regions and demonstrate their dependence on $ \theta_{\rm rl}$.
