we study the dynamics of a driven optomechanical cavity coupled to a charged nanomechanical resonator via coulomb interaction , in which the tunable double optomechanically induced transparency ( omit ) can be observed from the output field at the probe frequency by controlling the strength of the coulomb interaction . we calculate the splitting of the two transparency windows , which varies near linearly with the coulomb coupling strength in a robust way against the cavity decay . our double - omit is much different from previously mentioned double - eit and can be applied to measure coulomb coupling strength .
