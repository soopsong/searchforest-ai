we present both experimental and theoretical investigations of a laser - driven quantum dot ( qd ) in the dressed - state regime of resonance fluorescence . we explore the role of phonon scattering and pure dephasing on the detuning - dependence of the mollow triplet and show that the triplet sidebands may spectrally broaden or narrow with increasing detuning . based on a polaron master equation approach which includes electron - phonon interaction nonperturbatively , we derive a fully analytical expression for the spectrum . with respect to detuning dependence , we identify a crossover between the regimes of spectral sideband narrowing or broadening . a comparison of the theoretical predictions to detailed experimental studies on the laser detuning - dependence of mollow triplet resonance emission from single in(ga)as qds reveals excellent agreement .
