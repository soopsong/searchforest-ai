we obtain the exact expression for the von neumann entropy for an infinite bipartition of the xyz model , by connecting its reduced density matrix to the corner transfer matrix of the eight vertex model . then we consider the anisotropic scaling limit of the xyz chain that yields the 1 + 1 dimensional sine - gordon model . we present the formula for the entanglement entropy of the latter , which has the structure of a dominant logarithmic term plus a constant , in agreement with what is generally expected for a massive quantum field theory .
