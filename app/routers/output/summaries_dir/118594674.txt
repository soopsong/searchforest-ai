association rules mining ( arm ) is one of the most important problems in knowledge discovery and data mining . given a transaction database that has a large number of transactions and items , the task of arm is to acquire consumption habits of customers by discovering the relationships between itemsets ( sets of items ) . in this paper , we address arm in the quantum settings and propose a quantum algorithm for the key part of arm , finding out frequent itemsets from the candidate itemsets and acquiring their supports . specifically , for the case in which there are $ m_f^{(k)}$ frequent $ k$-itemsets in the $ m_c^{(k)}$ candidate $ k$-itemsets ( $ m_f^{(k ) } \leq m_c^{(k)}$ ) , our algorithm can efficiently mine these frequent $ k$-itemsets and estimate their supports by using parallel amplitude estimation and amplitude amplification with complexity $ \mathcal{o}(\frac{k\sqrt{m_c^{(k)}m_f^{(k)}}}{\epsilon})$ , where $ \epsilon$ is the error for estimating the supports . compared with the classical counterpart , classical sampling - based algorithm , whose complexity is $ \mathcal{o}(\frac{km_c^{(k)}}{\epsilon^2})$ , our quantum algorithm quadratically improves the dependence on both $ \epsilon$ and $ m_c^{(k)}$ in the best case when $ m_f^{(k)}\ll m_c^{(k)}$ and on $ \epsilon$ alone in the worst case when $ m_f^{(k)}\approx m_c^{(k)}$.
