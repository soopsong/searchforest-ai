in this chapter a quantum communication protocol with use of repeaters is presented . the protocol is constructed for qudits i.e. the generalized quantum information units . one - dit teleportation is based on the generalized pauli - z ( phase - flip ) gate 's correction . this approach avoids using pauli - x and hadamard gates unlike in other known protocols based on quantum repeaters which were constructed for qubits and qudits . it is also important to mention that the repeaters based on teleportation protocol , described in this chapter , allow a measurement in the standard base ( what simplifies the measurement process ) and the use of teleportation causes only pauli - z operational errors .
