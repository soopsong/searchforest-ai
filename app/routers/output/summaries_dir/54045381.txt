parametric downconversion ( pdc ) in semiconductor bragg - reflection waveguides ( brw ) is routinely exploited for photon - pair generation in the telecommunication range . contrary to many conventional pdc sources , brws offer possibilities to create spectrally broadband but nevertheless indistinguishable photon pairs in orthogonal polarizations that simultaneously incorporate high frequency entanglement . we explore the characteristics of co - propagating twin beams created in a type - ii ridge brw . our pdc source is bright and efficient , which serves as a benchmark of its performance and justifies its exploitation for further use in quantum photonics . we then examine the coalescence of the twin beams and investigate the effect of their inevitable multi - photon contributions on the observed photon bunching . our results show that brws have a great potential for producing broadband indistinguishable photon pairs as well as multi - photon states .
