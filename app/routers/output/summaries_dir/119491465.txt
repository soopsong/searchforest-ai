we theoretically explore a quantum memory using a single nanoparticle levitated in an optical dipole trap and subjected to feedback cooling . this protocol is realized by storing and retrieving a single photon quantum state from a mechanical mode in levitated cavityless optomechanics . we describe the effectiveness of the photon - phonon - photon transfer in terms of the fidelity , the wigner function , and the zero - delay second - order autocorrelation function . for experimentally accessible parameters , our numerical results indicate robust conversion of the quantum states of the input signal photon to those of the retrieved photon . we also show that high fidelity single - photon wavelength conversion is possible in the system as long as intense control pulses shorter than the mechanical damping time are used . our work opens up the possibility of using levitated optomechanical systems for applications of quantum information processing .
