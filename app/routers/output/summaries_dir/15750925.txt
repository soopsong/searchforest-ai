large - scale digital quantum simulations require thousands of fundamental entangling gates to construct the simulated dynamics . despite success in a variety of small - scale simulations , quantum information processing platforms have hitherto failed to demonstrate the combination of precise control and scalability required to systematically outmatch classical simulators . we analyse how fast gates could enable trapped - ion quantum processors to achieve the requisite scalability to outperform classical computers without error correction . we analyze the performance of a large - scale digital simulator , and find that fidelity of around 70 % is realizable for pi - pulse infidelities below $ 10^{-5}$ in traps subject to realistic rates of heating and dephasing . this scalability relies on fast gates : entangling gates faster than the trap period .
