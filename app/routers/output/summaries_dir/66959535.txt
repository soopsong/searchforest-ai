quantum entanglement is a building block of the entangled quantum networks of the quantum internet . a fundamental problem of the quantum internet is entanglement distribution . since quantum entanglement will be fundamental to any future quantum networking scenarios , the distribution mechanism of quantum entanglement is a critical and emerging issue in quantum networks . here we define the method of opportunistic entanglement distribution for the quantum internet . the opportunistic model defines distribution sets that are aimed to select those quantum nodes for which the cost function picks up a local minimum . the cost function utilizes the error patterns of the local quantum memories and the predictability of the evolution of the entanglement fidelities . our method provides efficient entanglement distributing with respect to the actual statuses of the local quantum memories of the node pairs . the model provides an easily - applicable , moderate - complexity solution for high - fidelity entanglement distribution in experimental quantum internet scenarios .
