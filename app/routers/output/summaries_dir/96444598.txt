we investigate the inhomogeneous rashba chain coupled to a superconducting substrate , hosting the majorana quasiparticles near its edges . we discuss its subgap spectrum and study how robust are the zero - energy quasiparticles against the diagonal and off - diagonal disorder . studying the $ \mathbb{z}_2 $ topological invariant we show that disorder induced transition from the topologically non - trivial to trivial phases is manifested by characteristic features in the spatially - resolved quasiparticle spectrum at zero energy . we provide evidence for the non - local nature of the zero - energy majorana quasiparticles , that are well preserved upon partitioning the chain into separate pieces . even though the majorana quasiparticles are not completely immune to inhomogeneity we show that they can spread onto other ( normal ) nanoscopic objects via the proximity effect .
