we present the design and implementation of a trapped ion cavity qed system . a single ytterbium ion is confined by a micron - scale ion trap inside a 2 mm optical cavity . the ion is coherently pumped by near resonant laser light while the cavity output is monitored as a function of pump intensity and cavity detuning . we observe a purcell enhancement of scattered light into the solid angle subtended by the optical cavity , as well as a three - peak structure arising from strongly driving the atom . this system can be integrated into existing atom{photon quantum network protocols and is a pathway towards an efficient atom{photon quantum interface .
