we investigate the dynamics of information among the parties of tripartite systems . we start by proving two results concerning the monogamy of mutual information . the first one states that mutual information is monogamous for generic tripartite pure states . the second shows that in general mutual information is monogamous only if the amount of genuine tripartite correlations is large enough . then , we analyze the internal dynamics of tripartite systems whose parties do not exchange energy . in particular , we allow for one of the subsystems to play the role of a finite thermal bath . as a result , we find a typical scenario in which local information tends to be converted into delocalized information . moreover , we show that ( i ) the information flow is reversible for finite thermal baths at low temperatures , ( ii ) monogamy of mutual information is respected throughout the dynamics , and ( iii ) genuine tripartite correlations are typically present . finally , we analytically calculate a quantity capable of revealing favorable regimes for non - markovianity in our model .
