we describe how a quantum system composed of a cavity field interacting with a movable mirror can be utilized to generate a large variety of nonclassical states of both the cavity field and the mirror . first we consider state preparation of the cavity field . the system dynamics will prepare a single mode of the cavity field in a multicomponent schr\"{o}dinger cat state , in a similar manner to that in a kerr medium . in addition , when two or more cavity modes interact with the mirror , they may be prepared in an entangled state which may be regarded as a multimode generalisation of even and odd coherent states . we show also that near - number states of a single mode may be prepared by performing a measurement of the position of the mirror . secondly we consider state preparation of the mirror , and show that this macroscopic object may be placed in a scr\"{o}dinger cat state by a quadrature measurement of the light field . in addition we examine the effect of the damping of the motion of the mirror on the field states inside the cavity , and compare this with the effect of cavity field damping .
