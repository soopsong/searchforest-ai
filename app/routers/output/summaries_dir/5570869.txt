the study of non - locality is fundamental to the understanding of quantum mechanics . the past 50 years have seen a number of non - locality proofs , but its fundamental building blocks , and the exact role it plays in quantum protocols , has remained elusive . in this paper , we focus on a particular flavour of non - locality , generalising mermin 's argument on the ghz state . using strongly complementary observables , we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for mermin non - locality in abstract process theories . we show that the existence of more phases than classical points ( aka eigenstates ) is not sufficient , and that the key to mermin non - locality lies in the presence of certain algebraically non - trivial phases . this allows us to show that frel , a favourite toy model for categorical quantum mechanics , is mermin local . we show mermin non - locality to be the key resource ensuring the device - independent security of the hbb cq ( n , n ) family of quantum secret sharing protocols . finally , we challenge the unspoken assumption that the measurements involved in mermin - type scenarios should be complementary ( like the pair x , y ) , opening the doors to a much wider class of potential experimental setups than currently employed . in short , we give conditions for mermin non - locality tests on any number of systems , where each party has an arbitrary number of measurement choices , where each measurement has an arbitrary number of outcomes and further , that works in any abstract process theory .
