the coupling of spins to long - wavelength bosonic modes is a prominent means to engineer long - range spin - spin interactions , and has been realized in a variety of platforms , such as atoms in optical cavities and trapped ions . to date , much of the experimental focus has been on the realization of long - range ising models , but generalizations to other spin models are highly desirable . in this work , we explore a previously unappreciated connection between the realization of an xy model by off - resonant driving of single sideband of boson excitation ( i.e.~a single - beam m{\o}lmer - s{\o}rensen scheme ) and a boson - mediated ising simulator in the presence of a transverse field . in particular , we show that these two schemes have the same effective hamiltonian in suitably defined rotating frames , and analyze the emergent effective xy spin model through truncated magnus series and numerical simulations . in addition to xy spin - spin interactions that can be non - perturbatively renormalized from the naive ising spin - spin coupling constants , we find an effective transverse field that is dependent on the thermal energy of the bosons , as well as other spin - boson couplings that cause spin - boson entanglement not to vanish at any time . in the case of a boson - mediated ising simulator with transverse field , we discuss the crossover from transverse - field ising - like to xy - like spin behavior as a function of field strength .
