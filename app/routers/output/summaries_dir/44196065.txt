when comparing quantum states to each other , it is possible to obtain an unambiguous answer , indicating that the states are definitely different , already after a single measurement . in this paper we investigate comparison of coherent states , which is the simplest example of quantum state comparison for continuous variables . the method we present has a high success probability , and is experimentally feasible to realize as the only required components are beam splitters and photon detectors . an easily realizable method for quantum state comparison could be important for real applications . as examples of such applications we present a"lock and key"scheme and a simple scheme for quantum public key distribution .
