polynomials in this paper are defined starting from a compact semisimple lie group . a known classification of maximal , semisimple subgroups of simple lie groups is used to select the cases to be considered here . a general method is presented and all the cases of rank not greater then 3 are explicitly studied . we derive the polynomials of simple lie groups b_3 and c_3 as they are not available elsewhere . the results point to far reaching lie theoretical connections to the theory of multivariable orthogonal polynomials .
