we study a protocol in which many parties use quantum communication to transfer a shared state to a receiver without communicating with each other . this protocol is a multiparty version of the fully quantum slepian - wolf protocol for two senders and arises through the repeated application of the two - sender protocol . we describe bounds on the achievable rate region for the distributed compression problem . the inner bound arises by expressing the achievable rate region for our protocol in terms of its vertices and extreme rays and , equivalently , in terms of facet inequalities . we also prove an outer bound on all possible rates for distributed compression based on the multiparty squashed entanglement , a measure of multiparty entanglement .
