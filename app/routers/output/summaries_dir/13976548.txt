a method for measuring the transmittivity of optical samples by using squeezed -- vacuum radiation is illustrated . a squeezed vacuum field generated by a below -- threshold optical parametric oscillator is propagated through a nondispersive medium and detected by a homodyne apparatus . the variance of the detected quadrature is used for measuring the transmittivity . with this method it is drastically reduced the number of photons passing through the sample during the measurement interval . the results of some tests are reported .
