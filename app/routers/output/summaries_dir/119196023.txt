intense spatio - spectral twin beams generated in the regime with pump depletion are analyzed applying a suggested quantum model that treats the signal , idler and pump fields in the same way . the model assumes the signal and idler fields in the form of the generalized superposition of signal and noise and reveals nonzero signal coherent components in both fields , contrary to the models developed earlier . the influence of coherent components on the properties of intense twin beams is elucidated . the interference pattern formed in the process of sum - frequency generation and that of the hong - ou - mandel interferometer are shown to be able to experimentally confirm the presence of coherent components .
