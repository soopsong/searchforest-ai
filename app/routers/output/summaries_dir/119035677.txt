the geometric entanglement entropy of a quantum field in the vacuum state is known to be divergent and , when regularized , to scale as the area of the boundary of the region . here we introduce an operational definition of the entropy of the vacuum restricted to a region : we consider a subalgebra of observables that has support in the region and a finite resolution . we then define the entropy of a state restricted to this subalgebra . for gaussian states , such as the vacuum of a free scalar field , we discuss how this entropy can be computed . in particular we show that for a spherical region we recover an area law under a suitable refinement of the subalgebra .
