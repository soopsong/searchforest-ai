hypercontractivity of a quantum dynamical semigroup has strong implications for its convergence behavior and entropy decay rate . a logarithmic sobolev inequality and the corresponding logarithmic sobolev constant can be inferred from the semigroup 's hypercontractive norm bound . we consider completely - positive quantum mechanical semigroups described by a lindblad master equation . to prove the norm bound , we follow an approach which has its roots in the study of classical rate equations . we use interpolation theorems for non - commutative $ l_p$ spaces to obtain a general hypercontractive inequality from a particular $ p \rightarrow q$-norm bound . then , we derive a bound on the $ 2 \rightarrow 4$-norm from an analysis of the block diagonal structure of the semigroup 's spectrum . we show that the dynamics of an $ n$-qubit graph state hamiltonian weakly coupled to a thermal environment is hypercontractive . as a consequence this allows for the efficient preparation of graph states in time $ { \rm poly}(\log(n))$ by coupling at sufficiently low temperature . furthermore , we extend our results to gapped liouvillians arising from a weak linear coupling of a free - fermion systems .
