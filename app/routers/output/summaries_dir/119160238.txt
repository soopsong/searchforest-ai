a quantum system s undergoing continuous time measurement is usually described by a jump - diffusion stochastic differential equation . such an equation is called a stochastic master equation and its solution is called a quantum trajectory . this solution describes actually the evolution of the state of s. in the context of quantum non demolition measurement , we investigate the large time behavior of this solution . it is rigorously shown that , for large time , this solution behaves as if a direct von neumann measurement has been performed at time 0 . in particular the solution converges to a random pure state which is related to the wave packet reduction postulate . using theory of girsanov transformation , we determine precisely the exponential rate of convergence towards this random state . the important problem of state estimation ( used in experiment ) is also investigated .
