we study the problem of witnessing entanglement among indistinguishable particles . for this purpose , we derive a set of equations which results in necessary and sufficient conditions for probing multipartite entanglement between arbitrary systems of bosons or fermions . the solution of these equations yields the construction of optimal entanglement witnesses for partial and full entanglement in discrete and continuous variable systems . our approach unifies the verification of entanglement for distinguishable and indistinguishable particles . we provide general solutions for certain observables to study quantum entanglement in systems with different quantum statistics in noisy environments .
