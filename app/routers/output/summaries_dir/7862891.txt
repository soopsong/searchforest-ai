using invariance of the $ n$-th tensored state w.r.t . the $ n$-th symmetric group , we propose a ' variable length ' universal entanglement concentration without classical communication . like variable length data compression , arbitrary unknown states are concentrated into perfect bell states and not approximate bell states and the number of bell states obtained is equal to the optimal rate asymptotically with the probability 1 . one of the point of our scheme is that we need no classical communication at all . using this method , we can construct a universal teleportation and a universal dense coding .
