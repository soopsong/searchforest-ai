we work in the real hilbert space h_s of hermitian hilbert - schmid operators and show that the entanglement witness which shows the maximal violation of a generalized bell inequality ( gbi ) is a tangent functional to the convex set s subset h_s of separable states . this violation equals the euclidean distance in h_s of the entangled state to s and thus entanglement , gbi and tangent functional are only different aspects of the same geometric picture . this is explicitly illustrated in the example of two spins , where also a comparison with familiar bell inequalities is presented .
