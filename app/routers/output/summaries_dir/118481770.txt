we investigate interference and correlation effects when several detuned emitters are placed along a one - dimensional photonic waveguide . such a setup allows multiple interactions between the photons and the strongly coupled emitters , and underlies proposed devices for quantum information processing . we show , first , that a pair of detuned two - level systems ( 2ls ) separated by a half wavelength mimic a driven { \lambda}-type three - level system ( 3ls ) in both the single- and two- photon sectors . there is an interference - induced transparency peak at which the fluorescence is quenched , leaving the transmitted photons completely uncorrelated . slightly away from this separation , we find that the inelastic scattering ( fluorescence ) is large , leading to nonlinear effects such as non - reciprocity ( rectification ) . we connect this non - reciprocity to inelastic scattering caused by driving a dark pole and so derive a condition for maximum rectification . finally , by placing a true 3ls midway between the two 2ls , we show that elastic scattering produces only transmission , but inelastic scattering nevertheless occurs ( the fluorescence is not quenched ) causing substantial photon correlations .
