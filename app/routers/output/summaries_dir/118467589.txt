we report the realisation of a fibred polarisation entangled photon - pair source at 1560 nm based on a type - ii non linear interaction and working in the picosecond regime . by taking advantage of a set of filters , we deterministically separate the photons and project them into wavelength separable states . a standard entanglement measurement with a net interference visibility close to 1 , proves the relevance of our approach as an enabling technology for entanglement - based quantum communication .
