we propose a scheme involving a cooper pair transistor ( cpt ) embedded in a superconducting microwave cavity , where the cpt serves as a charge tunable quantum inductor to facilitate ultra - strong coupling between photons in the cavity and a nano- to meso - scale mechanical resonator . the mechanical resonator is capacitively coupled to the cpt , such that mechanical displacements of the resonator cause a shift in the cpt inductance and hence the cavity 's resonant frequency . the amplification provided by the cpt is sufficient for the zero point motion of the mechanical resonator alone to cause a significant change in the cavity resonance . conversely , a single photon in the cavity causes a shift in the mechanical resonator position on the order of its zero point motion . as a result , the cavity - cooper pair transistor ( ccpt ) coupled to a mechanical resonator will be able to access a regime in which single photons can affect single phonons and vice versa . realizing this ultra - strong coupling regime will facilitate the creation of non - classical states of the mechanical resonator , as well as the means to accurately characterize such states by measuring the cavity photon field .
