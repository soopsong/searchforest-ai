farhi et al . recently proposed a class of quantum algorithms , the quantum approximate optimization algorithm ( qaoa ) , for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems . a level - p qaoa circuit consists of p steps ; in each step a classical hamiltonian , derived from the cost function , is applied followed by a mixing hamiltonian . the 2p times for which these two hamiltonians are applied are the parameters of the algorithm , which are to be optimized classically for the best performance . as p increases , parameter optimization becomes inefficient due to the curse of dimensionality . the success of the qaoa approach will depend , in part , on finding effective parameter - setting strategies . here , we analytically and numerically study parameter setting for qaoa applied to maxcut . for level-1 qaoa , we derive an analytical expression for a general graph . in principle , expressions for higher p could be derived , but the number of terms quickly becomes prohibitive . for a special case of maxcut , the ring of disagrees , or the 1d antiferromagnetic ring , we provide an analysis for arbitrarily high level . using a fermionic representation , the evolution of the system under qaoa translates into quantum control of an ensemble of independent spins . this treatment enables us to obtain analytical expressions for the performance of qaoa for any p. it also greatly simplifies numerical search for the optimal values of the parameters . by exploring symmetries , we identify a lower - dimensional sub - manifold of interest ; the search effort can be accordingly reduced . this analysis also explains an observed symmetry in the optimal parameter values . further , we numerically investigate the parameter landscape and show that it is a simple one in the sense of having no local optima .
