we present a method for constructing parent hamiltonians for the chiral spin liquid . we find two distinct hamiltonians for which the chiral spin liquid on a square lattice is an exact zero - energy ground state . we diagonalize both hamiltonians numerically for 16-site lattices , and find that the chiral spin liquid , modulo its two - fold topological degeneracy , is indeed the unique ground state for one hamiltonian , while it is not unique for the other .
