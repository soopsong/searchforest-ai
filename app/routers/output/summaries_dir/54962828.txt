we propose a detailed study of the geometric entanglement properties of pure symmetric n - qubit states , focusing more particularly on the identification of symmetric states with a high geometric entanglement and how their entanglement behaves asymptotically for large n. we show that much higher geometric entanglement with improved asymptotical behavior can be obtained in comparison with the highly entangled balanced dicke states studied previously . we also derive an upper bound for the geometric measure of entanglement of symmetric states . the connection with the quantumness of a state is discussed .
