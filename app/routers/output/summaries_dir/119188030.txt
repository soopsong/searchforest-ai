photon - number - revolving ( pnr ) detection allows the direct measurement of the wigner quasiprobability distribution of an optical mode without the need for numerically processing an inverse radon transform [ k. banaszek and k. w\'odkiewicz , phys . rev . lett . 76 , 4344 ( 1996 ) ] . in this work , we reproduced the seminal experiment of banaszek et al . [ phys . rev . a 60 , 674 ( 1999 ) ] of quantum tomography of a pure coherent state , and of a statistical mixture thereof , and extended it to the more general case of photon fluxes with much more than one photon per detection time . this was made possible by the use of a superconducting transition - edge sensor to perform pnr detection from 0 to 5 photons at 1064 nm , at about 70 % system efficiency and with no dead time . we detail signal acquisition and detection efficiency and discuss prospects for applying such quantum tomography to non - gaussian states .
