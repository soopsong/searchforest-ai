in quantum information , complementarity of quantum mechanical observables plays a key role . if a system resides in an eigenstate of an observable , the probability distribution for the values of a complementary observable is flat . the eigenstates of these two observables form a pair of mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) . more generally , a set of mubs consists of bases that are all pairwise unbiased . except for specific dimensions of the hilbert space , the maximal sets of mubs are unknown in general . even for a dimension as low as six , the identification of a maximal set of mubs remains an open problem , although there is strong numerical evidence that no more than three simultaneous mubs do exist . here , by exploiting a newly developed holographic technique , we implement and test different sets of three mubs for a single photon six - dimensional quantum state ( a qusix ) , encoded either in a hybrid polarization - orbital angular momentum or a pure orbital angular momentum hilbert space . a close agreement is observed between theory and experiments . our results can find applications in state tomography , quantitative wave - particle duality , quantum key distribution and tests on complementarity and logical indeterminacy .
