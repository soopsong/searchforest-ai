nonclassical state is an essential resource for quantum - enhanced communication , computing and metrology to outperform their classical counterpart . the nonclassical states that can operate at high bandwidth and room temperature while being compatible with quantum memory are highly desirable to enable the scalability of quantum technologies . here , we present a direct observation of broadband nonclasscal states in a room - temperature light - matter interface , where the atoms can also be controlled to store and interfere with photons . with a single coupling pulse and far off - resonance configuration , we are able to induce a multi - field interference between light and atoms to create the desired nonclassical states by spectrally selecting the two correlated photons out of seven possible emissions . we explicitly confirm the nonclassicality by observing a cross correlation up to 17 and a violation of cauchy - schwarz inequality with 568 standard deviations . our results demonstrate the potential of a state - built - in , broadband and room - temperature light - matter interface for scalable quantum information networks .
