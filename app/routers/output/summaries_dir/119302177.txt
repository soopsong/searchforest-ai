in order to achieve universal quantum computation using continuous variables , one needs to jump out of the set of gaussian operations and have a non - gaussian element , such as the cubic phase gate . however , such a gate is currently very difficult to implement in practice . here we introduce an experimentally viable ' repeat - until - success ' approach to generating the cubic phase gate , which is achieved using sequential photon subtractions and gaussian operations . we find that our scheme offers benefits in terms of the expected time until success , although we require a primitive quantum memory .
