we study a range of radio - frequency ion trap geometries and investigate the effect of integrating dielectric cavity mirrors on their trapping potential . we aim to identify ion trap and cavity configurations that are best suited for achieving small cavity volumes and thus large ion - photon coupling as required for scalable quantum information networks . in particular , we investigate the trapping potential distortions caused by the dielectric material of the cavity mirrors for different mirror orientations with respect to the trapping electrodes , as well as for mirror misalignment . we also analyze the effect of the mirror material properties such as dielectric constants and surface conductivity , and study the effect of surface charges on the mirrors . the smallest trapping potential distortions are found if the cavities are aligned along the major symmetry axis of the electrode geometries . these cavity configurations also appear to be the most stable with respect to any mirror misalignment .
