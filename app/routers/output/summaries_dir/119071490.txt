entanglement witnesses provide tools to detect entanglement in experimental situations without the need of having full tomographic knowledge about the state . if one estimates in an experiment an expectation value smaller than zero , one can directly infer that the state has been entangled , or specifically multi - partite entangled , in the first place . in this article , we emphasize that all these tests - based on the very same data - give rise to quantitative estimates in terms of entanglement measures:"if a test is strongly violated , one can also infer that the state was quantitatively very much entangled " . we consider various measures of entanglement , including the negativity , the entanglement of formation , and the robustness of entanglement , in the bipartite and multipartite setting . as examples , we discuss several experiments in the context of quantum state preparation that have recently been performed .
