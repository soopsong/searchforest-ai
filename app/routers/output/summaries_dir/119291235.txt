a procedure to obtain the dynamics of $ n$ independent qudits ( $ d$-level systems ) each interacting with its own reservoir , for any arbitrary initial state , is presented . this is then applied to study the dynamics of the entanglement of two qubits , initially in an extended werner - like mixed state with each of them in a zero temperature non - markovian environment . the dependence of the entanglement dynamics on the purity and degree of entanglement of the initial states and on the amount of non - markovianity is also given . this extends the previous work about non - markovian effects on the two - qubit entanglement dynamics for initial bell - like states [ b. bellomo \textit{et al . } , phys . rev . lett . \textbf{99 } , 160502 ( 2007 ) ] . the effect of temperature on the two - qubit entanglement dynamics in a markovian environment is finally obtained .
