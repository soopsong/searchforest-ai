we present the experimental quantum tomography of 7- and 8-dimensional quantum systems based on projective measurements in the mutually unbiased basis ( mub - qt ) . one of the advantages of mub - qt is that it requires projections from a minimal number of bases to be performed . in our scheme , the higher dimensional quantum systems are encoded using the propagation modes of single photons , and we take advantage of the capabilities of amplitude- and phase - modulation of programmable spatial light modulators to implement the mub - qt .
