we report on a new computer study into the existence of d^2 equiangular lines in d complex dimensions . such maximal complex projective codes are conjectured to exist in all finite dimensions and are the underlying mathematical objects defining symmetric informationally complete measurements in quantum theory . we provide numerical solutions in all dimensions d<= 67 and , moreover , a putatively complete list of weyl - heisenberg covariant solutions for d<= 50 . a symmetry analysis of this list leads to new algebraic solutions in dimensions d = 24 , 35 and 48 , which are given together with algebraic solutions for d = 4 , ... , 15 and 19 .
