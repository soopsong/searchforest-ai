recently , a minimal membrane description of the entanglement dynamics of large regions in generic chaotic systems was conjectured in arxiv:1803.00089 . analytic results in random circuits and spin chain numerics support this theory . we show that the results found by the author in arxiv:1612.00082 about the dynamics of entanglement entropy in theories with a holographic dual can be reformulated in terms of the same minimal membrane , providing strong evidence that the membrane theory describes all chaotic systems . we discuss the implications of our results for tensor network approaches to holography and the holographic renormalization group .
