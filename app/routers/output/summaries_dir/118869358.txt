we investigate the approximate quantum state sharing protocol based on random unitary channels , which is secure against any exterior or interior attackers in principle . although the protocol leaks small information for a security parameter $ \epsilon$ , the scheme still preserves its information - theoretic secrecy , and reduces some pre - shared classical secret keys for a private quantum channel between a sender and two receivers . the approximate private quantum channels constructed via random unitary channels play a crucial role in the proposed quantum state sharing protocol .
