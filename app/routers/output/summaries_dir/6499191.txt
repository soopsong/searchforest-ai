with nowadays steadily growing quantum processors , it is required to develop new quantum tomography tools that are tailored for high - dimensional systems . in this work , we describe such a computational tool , based on recent ideas from non - convex optimization . the algorithm excels in the compressed - sensing - like setting , where only a few data points are measured from a low - rank or highly - pure quantum state of a high - dimensional system . we show that the algorithm can practically be used in quantum tomography problems that are beyond the reach of convex solvers , and , moreover , is faster than other state - of - the - art non - convex approaches . crucially , we prove that , despite being a non - convex program , under mild conditions , the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the global minimum of the problem ; thus , it constitutes a provable quantum state tomography protocol .
