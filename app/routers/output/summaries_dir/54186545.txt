universal speeded - up adiabatic geometric quantum computation~(sagqc ) is studied in $ \lambda$-type three - level system with different coupling cases , i.e. , time - dependent detuning , large detuning and one - photon resonance couplings , respectively . in these cases , the counterdiabatic driving method is used to speed up the universal quantum computation . these schemes in $ \lambda$-type three - level system are feasible in experiment because additional unaccessible ground - state - coupling is not needed . only the shapes and phases of the initial adiabatic classical - field pulse are modified with the aid of effective two - level systems based on the counterdiabatic driving . the speed and robustness against decay of these schemes are discussed and compared . in addition , our work enriches the study of the speeded - up geometric computation in $ \lambda$-type three - level system and can be applied to various experimental platforms with different coupling features .
