quantum random number generators ( qrngs ) can significantly improve the security of cryptographic protocols , by ensuring that generated keys can not be predicted . however , the cost , size , and power requirements of current qrngs has prevented them from becoming widespread . in the meantime , the quality of the cameras integrated in mobile telephones has improved significantly , so that now they are sensitive to light at the few - photon level . we demonstrate how these can be used to generate random numbers of a quantum origin .
