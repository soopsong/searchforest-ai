we develop a dynamical approach based on the schwinger - keldysh formalism to derive a field - theoretic description of disordered and interacting electron systems . we calculate within this formalism the perturbative rg equations for interacting electrons expanded around a diffusive fermi liquid fixed point , as obtained originally by finkelstein using replicas . the major simplifying feature of this approach , as compared to finkelstein 's is that instead of $ n \to 0 $ replicas , we only need to consider n=2 species . we compare the dynamical schwinger - keldysh approach and the replica methods , and we present a simple and pedagogical rg procedure to obtain finkelstein 's rg equations .
