we study the effects of dispersion in carrier waves on the properties of soliton self -- induced transparency ( sit ) in two level media . we found substantial impact of dispersion effects on typical sit soliton features . for example , the degree of sit pulse velocity slowing down ( acceleration ) is determined by the ratio of the incoming pulse frequency over atomic transition frequency - $ x=\omega/\omega_0$. specifically , an immediate pulse stopping is predicted for absorbing media when pulse duration time exceeds some critical value . in the sharp line limit stopping may emerge only for frequency ratio above unity , while for the inhomogeneously broadened systems it appears irrespective of the value of $ x$. analysis performed on the basis of mcall\&hahn \textit{area theorem } implies that pulse stopping is achieved when ber 's absorption coefficient approaches infinity , that is , pulse energy is fully absorbed in the medium . in the case of amplifying media super - luminal motion is predicted as in the case of resonance . however , there is a lowest value in the frequency ratio below which the pulse velocity tends to the sub - luminal region . these new features of the sit phenomenon open novel ways on how it may be exploited for the control of electromagnetic wave radiation in two - level media . this may be achieved by varying frequency ratio .
