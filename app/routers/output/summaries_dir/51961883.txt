a device being a pinnacle of development of an optical quantum memory should combine the capabilities of storage , inter - communication and processing of stored information . in particular , the ability to capture a train of optical pulses , interfere them in an arbitrary way and finally perform on - demand release would in a loose sense realize an optical analogue of a turing machine . here we demonstrate the operation of an optical quantum memory being able to store optical pulses in the form of collective spin - wave excitations in a multi - dimensional wavevector space . during storage , we perform complex beamsplitter operations and demonstrate a variety of protocol implemented as the processing stage , including interfering a pair of spin - wave modes with 95\% visibility . by engineering the phase - matching at the readout stage we realize the on - demand retrieval . the highly multimode structure of the presented quantum memory lends itself both to enhancing classical optical telecommunication as well as parallel processing of optical qubits at the single - photon level .
