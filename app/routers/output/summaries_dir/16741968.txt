except for the universe , all quantum systems are open , and according to quantum state diffusion theory , many systems localize to wave packets in the neighborhood of phase space points . this is due to decoherence from the interaction with the environment , and makes the quasiclassical limit of such systems both more realistic and simpler in many respects than the more familiar quasiclassical limit for closed systems . a linearized version of this theory leads to the correct classical dynamics in the macroscopic limit , even for nonlinear and chaotic systems . we apply the theory to the forced , damped duffing oscillator , comparing the numerical results of the full and linearized equations , and argue that this can be used to make explicit calculations in the decoherent histories formalism of quantum mechanics .
