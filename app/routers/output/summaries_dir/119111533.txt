anonymous voting is a voting method of hiding the link between a vote and a voter , the context of which ranges from governmental elections to decision making in small groups like councils or companies . in this paper , we propose a quantum anonymous voting protocol assisted by two kinds of entangled quantum states . particularly , we provide a mechanism of opening and permuting the ordered votes of all the voters in an anonymous manner ; any party , who is interested in the voting results , can acquire a permutation copy , and then obtains the voting result through simple calculation . unlike all previous quantum works on anonymous voting , our quantum anonymous protocol firstly possesses the properties of privacy , self - tallying , non - reusability , verifiability and fairness at the same time . besides , we demonstrate that the entanglement of the novel quantum states used in our protocol makes the attack from outside eavesdropper and inside dishonest voters impossible . we also generalize our protocol to execute tasks of anonymous multi - party computation , such as anonymous broadcast and anonymous ranking .
