the scintillation index is obtained for the practically important range of weak and moderate atmospheric turbulence . to study this challenging range , the boltzman - langevin kinetic equation , describing light propagation , is derived from first principles of quantum optics based on the technique of the photon distribution function ( pdf ) [ g. p. berman et al . , phys . rev . a 74 , 013805 ( 2006 ) ] . the paraxial approximation for laser beams reduces the collision integral for the pdf to a two - dimensional operator in the momentum space . analytical solutions for the average value of pdf as well as for its fluctuating constituent are obtained using an iterative procedure . the calculated scintillation index is considerably greater than that obtained within the rytov approximation even at moderate turbulence strength . the relevant explanation is proposed .
