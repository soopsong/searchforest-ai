we provide several schemes to construct the continuous - variable swap gate and present a hermitian generalized many - body continuous controlled^n - not gate . we introduce and study the hybrid controlled - not gate and controlled - swap gate , and physical realizations of them are discussed in trapped - ion systems . these continuous - variable and hybrid quantum gates may be used in the corresponding continuous - variable and hybrid quantum computations .
