in prior work , we have shown how the basic concepts and terms of quantum mechanics relate to factorizations and marginals of complex - valued \emph{quantum mass functions } , which are generalizations of joint probability mass functions . in this paper , using quantum mass functions , we discuss the realization of measurements in terms of unitary interactions and marginalizations . it follows that classical measurement results strictly belong to \emph{local } models , i.e. , marginals of more detailed models , over a limited period of interest . classical variables that are created by marginalization do not exist in the unmarginalized model , and different marginalizations may yield incompatible classical variables . these observations are illustrated by the frauchiger - renner paradox , which is analyzed in terms of quantum mass functions . throughout , the paper uses factor graphs to represent quantum systems / models with multiple measurements at different points in time .
