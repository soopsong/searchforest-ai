quantum information technologies harness the intrinsic nature of quantum theory to beat the limitations of the classical methods for information processing and communication . recently , the application of quantum features to metrology has attracted much attention . quantum optical coherence tomography ( qoct ) , which utilizes two - photon interference between entangled photon pairs , is a promising approach to overcome the problem with optical coherence tomography ( oct ) : as the resolution of oct becomes higher , degradation of the resolution due to dispersion within the medium becomes more critical . here we report on the realization of 0.54 $ \mu$m resolution two - photon interference , which surpasses the current record resolution 0.75 $ \mu$m of low - coherence interference for oct . in addition , the resolution for qoct showed almost no change against the dispersion of a 1 mm thickness of water inserted in the optical path , whereas the resolution for oct dramatically degrades . for this experiment , a highly - efficient chirped quasi - phase - matched lithium tantalate device was developed using a novel $ ` $ nano - electrode - poling$'$ technique . the results presented here represent a breakthrough for the realization of quantum protocols , including qoct , quantum clock synchronization , and more . our work will open up possibilities for medical and biological applications .
