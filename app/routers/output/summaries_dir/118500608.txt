in quantum information theory , the reliable and effective detection of entanglement is of paramount importance . however , given an unknown state , assessing its entanglement is a challenging task . to attack this problem , we investigate the use of random local measurements , from which entanglement witnesses are then constructed via semidefinite programming methods . we propose a scheme of successively increasing the number of measurements until the presence of entanglement can be unambiguously concluded , and investigate its performance in various examples .
