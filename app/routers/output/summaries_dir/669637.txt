we present a novel method of machining optical fiber surfaces with a co${}_2 $ laser for use in fiber - based fabry - perot cavities ( ffpcs ) . previously ffpcs were prone to large birefringence and limited to relatively short cavity lengths ( $ \le$ 200 $ \mu$m ) . these characteristics hinder their use in some applications such as cavity quantum electrodynamics with trapped ions . we optimized the laser machining process to produce large , uniform surface structures . this enables the cavities to achieve high finesse even for long cavity lengths . by rotating the fibers around their axis during the laser machining process the asymmetry resulting from the laser 's transverse mode profile is eliminated . consequently we are able to fabricate fiber mirrors with a high degree of rotational symmetry , leading to remarkably low birefringence . through measurements of the cavity finesse over a range of cavity lengths and the polarization dependence of the cavity linewidth , we confirmed the quality of the produced fiber mirrors for use in low - birefringence ffpcs .
