a preliminary overview of measurement - based quantum computation in the setting of symmetry and topological phases of quantum matter is given . the underlying mechanism for universal quantum computation by teleportation or symmetry are analyzed , with the emphasis on the relation with tensor - network states in the presence of various symmetries . perspectives are also given for the role of symmetry and phases of quantum matter in measurement - based quantum computation and fault tolerance .
