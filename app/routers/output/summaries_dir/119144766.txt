we investigate the implication of the non - linear and non - local multi - particle schroedinger - newton equation for the motion of the mass centre of an extended multi - particle object , giving self - contained and comprehensible derivations . in particular , we discuss two opposite limiting cases . in the first case , the width of the centre - of - mass wave packet is assumed much larger than the actual extent of the object , in the second case it is assumed much smaller . both cases result in non - linear deviations from ordinary free schroedinger evolution for the centre of mass . on a general conceptual level we include some discussion in order to clarify the physical basis and intention for studying the schroedinger - newton equation .
