interfacing single emitters and photonic nanostructures enables modifying their emission properties , such as enhancing individual decay rates or controlling the emission direction . to achieve full control , the single emitter must be positioned in the nanostructures deterministically . here , we use spectroscopy to gain spectral and spatial information about individual quantum dots in order to position each emitter in a pre - determined location in a unit cell of a photonic - crystal waveguide . depending on the spatial and spectral positioning within the structured nanophotonic mode , we observe that the quantum dot emission can either be suppressed or enhanced . these results demonstrate the capacity of photonic - crystal waveguides to control the emission of single photons and that the ability to position quantum dots will be crucial to the creation of complex multi - emitter quantum photonic circuits .
