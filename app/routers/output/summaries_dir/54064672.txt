for two electrically small nonreciprocal scatterers an analytical electromagnetic model of polarizabilities is developed . both particles are bianisotropic : the so - called tellegen - omega particle and moving - chiral particle . analytical results are compared to the full - wave numerical simulations . both models satisfy to main physical restrictions and leave no doubts in the possibility to realize these particles experimentally . this paper is a necessary step towards applications of nonreciprocal bianisotropic particles such as perfect electromagnetic isolators , twist polarizers , thin - sheet phase shifters , and other devices .
