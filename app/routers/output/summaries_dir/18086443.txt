recent theoretical investigations on quantum coherent feedback networks have found that with the same pump power , the einstein - podolski - rosen ( epr)-like entanglement generated via a dual nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier ( nopa ) system placed in a certain coherent feedback loop is stronger than the epr - like entangled pairs produced by a single nopa . in this paper , we present a linear quantum system consisting of two nopas and a static linear passive network of optical devices . the network has six inputs and six outputs , among which four outputs and four inputs are connected in a coherent feedback loop with the two nopas . this passive network is represented by a $ 6 \times 6 $ complex unitary matrix . a modified steepest descent method is used to find a passive complex unitary matrix at which the entanglement of this dual - nopa network is locally maximized . here we choose the matrix corresponding to a dual - nopa coherent feedback network from our previous work as a starting point for the modified steepest descent algorithm . by decomposing the unitary matrix obtained by the algorithm as the product of so - called two - level unitary matrices , we find an optimized configuration in which the complex matrix is realized by a static optical network made of beam splitters .
