we propose an experiment to detect and characterize the analog hawking radiation in an analog model of gravity consisting of a flowing exciton - polariton condensate . under a suitably designed coherent pump configuration , the condensate features an acoustic event horizon for sound waves that at the semiclassical level is equivalent to an astrophysical black hole horizon . we show that a continuous - wave pump - and - probe spectroscopy experiment allows to measure the analog hawking temperature from the dependence of the stimulated hawking effect on the pump - probe detuning . we anticipate the appearance of an emergent resonant cavity for sound waves between the pump beam and the horizon , which results in marked oscillations on top of an overall exponential frequency dependence . we finally analyze the spatial correlation function of density fluctuations and identify the hallmark features of the correlated pairs of bogoliubov excitations created by the spontaneous hawking process , as well as novel signatures characterizing the emergent cavity .
