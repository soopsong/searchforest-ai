entanglement behavior for different classes of two qubit systems passing through a generalized amplitude damping channel is discussed . the phenomena of sudden single , double changes and the sudden death of entanglement are reported for correlated and non- correlated noise . it is shown that , for less entangled states , these phenomena appear for small values of channel strength . the effect of the channel can be frozen for these classes as one increases the channel strength . maximum entangled states are more fragile than partial entangled states , where the entanglement decays very fast . however , one can not freeze the effect of the noise channel for systems initially prepared in maximum entangled states . the decay rate of entanglement for systems affected by non - correlated noise is much larger than that affected by correlated noise .
