memory effects are ubiquitous in nature and the class of memory circuit elements - which includes memristors , memcapacitors and meminductors - shows great potential to understand and simulate the associated fundamental physical processes . here , we show that such elements can also be used in electronic schemes mimicking biologically - inspired computer architectures , performing digital logic and arithmetic operations , and can expand the capabilities of certain quantum computation schemes . in particular , we will discuss few examples where the concept of memory elements is relevant to the realization of associative memory in neuronal circuits , spike - timing - dependent plasticity of synapses , digital and field - programmable quantum computing .
