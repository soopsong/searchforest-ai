selective truncation of fock - state expansion of an optical field can be achieved using projection synthesis . the process removes predetermined fock states from the input field by conditional measurement and teleportation . we present a scheme based on multiport interferometry to perform projection synthesis . this scheme can be used both as a generalized quantum scissors device , which filters out fock states with photon numbers higher than a predetermined value , and also as a quantum punching device , which selectively removes specific fock states making holes in the fock - state expansion of the input field .
