a markovian open quantum system which relaxes to a unique steady state $ \rho_{ss}$ of finite rank can be decomposed into a finite physically realizable ensemble ( pre ) of pure states . that is , as shown by karasik and wiseman [ phys . rev . lett . 106 , 020406 ( 2011 ) ] , in principle there is a way to monitor the environment so that in the long time limit the conditional state jumps between a finite number of possible pure states . in this paper we show how to apply this idea to the dynamics of a double quantum dot arising from the feedback control of quantum transport , as previously considered by one of us and co - workers [ phys . rev . b 84 , 085302 ( 2011 ) ] . specifically , we consider the limit where the system can be described as a qubit , and show that while the control scheme can always realize a two - state pre , in the incoherent tunneling regime there are infinitely many pres compatible with the dynamics that can not be so realized . for the two - state pres that are realized , we calculate the counting statistics and see a clear distinction between the coherent and incoherent regimes .
