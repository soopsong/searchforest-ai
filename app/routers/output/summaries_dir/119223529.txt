ultracold atoms are an ideal platform to study strongly correlated phases of matter in and out of equilibrium . much of the experimental progress in this field crucially relies on the control of the contact interaction between two atoms . control of strong long - range interactions between distant ground state atoms has remained a long standing goal , opening the path towards the study of fundamentally new quantum many - body systems including frustrated or topological magnets and supersolids . optical dressing of ground state atoms by near - resonant laser coupling to rydberg states has been proposed as a versatile method to engineer such interactions . however , up to now the great potential of this approach for interaction control in a many - body setting has eluded experimental confirmation . here we report the realisation of coherent rydberg - dressing in an ultracold atomic lattice gas and directly probe the induced interaction potential using an interferometric technique with single atom sensitivity . we use this approach to implement a two - dimensional synthetic spin lattice and demonstrate its versatility by tuning the range and anisotropy of the effective spin interactions . our measurements are in remarkable agreement with exact solutions of the many - body dynamics , providing further evidence for the high degree of accurate interaction control in these systems . finally , we identify a collective many - body decay process , and discuss possible routes to overcome this current limitation of coherence times . our work marks the first step towards the use of laser - controlled rydberg interactions for the study of exotic quantum magnets in optical lattices .
