we solve an open problem by constructing quantum walks that not only detect but also find marked vertices in a graph . in the case when the marked set $ m$ consists of a single vertex , the number of steps of the quantum walk is quadratically smaller than the classical hitting time $ ht(p , m)$ of any reversible random walk $ p$ on the graph . in the case of multiple marked elements , the number of steps is given in terms of a related quantity $ ht^+(\mathit{p , m})$ which we call extended hitting time . our approach is new , simpler and more general than previous ones . we introduce a notion of interpolation between the random walk $ p$ and the absorbing walk $ p'$ , whose marked states are absorbing . then our quantum walk is simply the quantum analogue of this interpolation . contrary to previous approaches , our results remain valid when the random walk $ p$ is not state - transitive . we also provide algorithms in the cases when only approximations or bounds on parameters $ p_m$ ( the probability of picking a marked vertex from the stationary distribution ) and $ ht^+(\mathit{p , m})$ are known .
