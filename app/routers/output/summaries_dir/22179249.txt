the triumph of heat engines is their ability to convert the disordered energy of thermal sources into useful mechanical motion . in recent years , much effort has been devoted to generalizing thermodynamic notions to the quantum regime , partly motivated by the promise of surpassing classical heat engines . here , we instead adopt a bottom - up approach : we propose a realistic autonomous heat engine that can serve as a testbed for quantum effects in the context of thermodynamics . our model draws inspiration from actual piston engines and is built from closed - system hamiltonians and weak bath coupling terms . we analytically derive the performance of the engine in the classical regime via a set of nonlinear langevin equations . in the quantum case , we perform numerical simulations of the master equation . finally , we perform a dynamic and thermodynamic analysis of the engine 's behaviour for several parameter regimes in both the classical and quantum case , and find that the latter exhibits a consistently lower efficiency due to additional noise .
