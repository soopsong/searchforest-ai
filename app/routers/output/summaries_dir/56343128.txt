we present a quantum - classical algorithm to study the dynamics of the two - spatial - site schwinger model on ibm 's quantum computers . using rotational symmetries , total charge , and parity , the number of qubits needed to perform computation is reduced by a factor of $ \sim 5 $ , removing exponentially - large unphysical sectors from the hilbert space . our work opens an avenue for exploration of other lattice quantum field theories , such as quantum chromodynamics , where classical computation is used to find symmetry sectors in which the quantum computer evaluates the dynamics of quantum fluctuations .
