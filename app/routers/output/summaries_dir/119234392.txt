we propose a single - photon frequency converter via a one - dimensional waveguide coupled to a $ v$-type atom . the on - demand classical field allows the atom to absorb a photon with a given frequency , then emit a photon with a carried frequency different from the absorbed one . the absorption and re - emission process is formulated as a two - channel scattering process . we study the single - photon frequency conversion mechanism in two kinds of realistic physical system : coupled resonator waveguide with cosine dispersion relation and an optical waveguide with linear dispersion relation respectively . we find that the driving field prefers weak in coupled resonator waveguide but arbitrarily strong in optical waveguide to achieve an optical transfer efficiency .
