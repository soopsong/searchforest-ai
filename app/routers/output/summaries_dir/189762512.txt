the first generation of multi - qubit quantum technologies will consist of noisy , intermediate - scale devices for which active error correction remains out of reach . to exploit such devices , it is thus imperative to use passive error protection that meets a careful trade - off between noise protection and resource overhead . here , we experimentally demonstrate that single - qubit encoding can significantly enhance the robustness of entanglement and coherence of four - qubit graph states against local noise with a preferred direction . in particular , we explicitly show that local encoding provides a significant practical advantage for phase estimation in noisy environments . this demonstrates the efficacy of local unitary encoding under realistic conditions , with potential applications in multi - qubit quantum technologies for metrology , multi - partite secrecy and error correction .
