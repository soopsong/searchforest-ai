the coherent process that a single photon simultaneously excites two qubits has recently been theoretically predicted by [ https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/physrevlett.117.043601 { phys . rev . lett . 117 , 043601 ( 2016 ) } ] . we propose a different approach to observe a similar dynamical process based on a superconducting quantum circuit , where two coupled flux qubits longitudinally interact with the same resonator . we show that this simultaneous excitation of two qubits ( assuming that the sum of their transition frequencies is close to the cavity frequency ) is related to the counter - rotating terms in the dipole - dipole coupling between two qubits , and the standard rotating - wave approximation is not valid here . by numerically simulating the adiabatic landau - zener transition and rabi - oscillation effects , we clearly verify that the energy of a single photon can excite two qubits via higher - order transitions induced by the longitudinal couplings and the counter - rotating terms . compared with previous studies , the coherent dynamics in our system only involves one intermediate state and , thus , exhibits a much faster rate . we also find transition paths which can interfere . finally , by discussing how to control the two longitudinal - coupling strengths , we find a method to observe both constructive and destructive interference phenomena in our system .
