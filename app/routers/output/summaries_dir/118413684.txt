we present a description of a strongly driven multimode optomechanical system that shows the emergence of cooperative effects usually known from systems of atom - light interaction . our calculations show that under application of a coherent pump field the system 's response can be switched from a superradiant regime to a collective gain regime by varying the frequency detuning of the pump . in the superradiant regime , enhanced optical cooling of a single vibrational mode is possible , whereas the collective gain regime would potentially enable one to achieve almost thresholdless phonon laser action . the threshold pumping power scales as 1 / n .
