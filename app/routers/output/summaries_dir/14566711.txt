we present a lower bound of concurrence for arbitrary dimensional bipartite quantum states . this lower bound may be used to improve all the known lower bounds of concurrence . moreover , the lower bound gives rise to an operational sufficient criterion of distillability of quantum entanglement . the significance of our result is illustrated by quantitative evaluation of entanglement for entangled states that fail to be identified by the usual concurrence estimation method , and by showing the distillability of mixed states that can not be recognized by other distillability criteria .
