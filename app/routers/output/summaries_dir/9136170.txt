memristors are low - power memory - holding resistors thought to be useful for neuromophic computing , which can compute via spike - interactions mediated through the device 's short - term memory . using interacting spikes , it is possible to build an and gate that computes or at the same time , similarly a full adder can be built that computes the arithmetical sum of its inputs . here we show how these gates can be understood by modelling the memristors as a novel type of perceptron : one which is sensitive to input order . the memristor 's memory can change the input weights for later inputs , and thus the memristor gates can not be accurately described by a single perceptron , requiring either a network of time - invarient perceptrons or a complex time - varying self - reprogrammable perceptron . this work demonstrates the high functionality of memristor logic gates , and also that the addition of theasholding could enable the creation of a standard perceptron in hardware , which may have use in building neural net chips .
