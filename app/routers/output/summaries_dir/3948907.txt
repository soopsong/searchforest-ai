we consider additive codes over gf(4 ) that are self - dual with respect to the hermitian trace inner product . such codes have a well - known interpretation as quantum codes and correspond to isotropic systems . it has also been shown that these codes can be represented as graphs , and that two codes are equivalent if and only if the corresponding graphs are equivalent with respect to local complementation and graph isomorphism . we use these facts to classify all codes of length up to 12 , where previously only all codes of length up to 9 were known . we also classify all extremal type ii codes of length 14 . finally , we find that the smallest type i and type ii codes with trivial automorphism group have length 9 and 12 , respectively .
