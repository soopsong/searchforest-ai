the identification of an unknown quantum gate is a significant issue in quantum technology . in this paper , we propose a quantum gate identification method within the framework of quantum process tomography . in this method , a series of pure states are inputted to the gate and then a fast state tomography on the output states is performed and the data are used to reconstruct the quantum gate . our algorithm has computational complexity $ o(d^3)$ with the system dimension $ d$. the algorithm is compared with maximum likelihood estimation method for the running time , which shows the efficiency advantage of our method . an error upper bound is established for the identification algorithm and the robustness of the algorithm against the purity of input states is also tested . we perform quantum optical experiment on single - qubit hadamard gate to verify the effectiveness of the identification algorithm .
