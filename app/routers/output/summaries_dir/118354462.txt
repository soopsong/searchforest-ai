thermal transistor is an efficient heat control device which can act as a heat switch as well as a heat modulator . in this paper , we study systematically one - dimensional and two - dimensional thermal transistors . in particular , we show how to improve significantly the efficiency of the one - dimensional thermal transistor . the study is also extended to the design of two - dimensional thermal transistor by coupling different anharmonic lattices such as the frenkel - kontorova and the fermi - pasta - ulam lattices . analogy between anharmonic lattices and single - walled carbon nanotube is drawn and possible experimental realization with multi - walled nanotube is suggested .
