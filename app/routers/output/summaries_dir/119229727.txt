we study the dynamics of a single photon pulse travels through a linear atomic chain coupled to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) single mode photonic waveguide . we derive a time - dependent dynamical theory for this collective many - body system which allows us to study the real time evolution of the photon transport and the atomic excitations . our analytical result is consistent with previous numerical calculations when there is only one atom . for an atomic chain , the collective interaction between the atoms mediated by the waveguide mode can significantly change the dynamics of the system . the reflectivity of a photon can be tuned by changing the ratio of coupling strength and the photon linewidth or by changing the number of atoms in the chain . the reflectivity of a single photon pulse with finite bandwidth can even approach $ 100\%$. the spectrum of the reflected and transmitted photon can also be significantly different from the single atom case . many interesting physical phenomena can occur in this system such as the photonic bandgap effects , quantum entanglement generation , fano - like interference , and superradiant effects . for engineering , this system may serve as a single photon frequency filter , single photon modulation and may find important applications in quantum information .
