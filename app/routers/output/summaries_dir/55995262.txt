cavity - qed systems have recently reached a regime where the light - matter interaction strength amounts to a non - negligible fraction of the resonance frequencies of the bare subsystems . in this regime , it is known that the usual normal - order correlation functions for the cavity - photon operators fail to describe both the rate and the statistics of emitted photons . following glauber 's original approach , we derive a simple and general quantum theory of photodetection , valid for arbitrary light - matter interaction strengths . our derivation uses fermi 's golden rule , together with an expansion of system operators in the eigenbasis of the interacting light - matter system , to arrive at the correct photodetection probabilities . we consider both narrow- and wide - band photodetectors . our description is also valid for point - like detectors placed inside the optical cavity . as an application , we propose a gedanken experiment confirming the virtual nature of the bare excitations that enrich the ground state of the quantum rabi model .
