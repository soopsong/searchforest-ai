we study the dynamics of the single atom maser , or micromaser , by means of the recently introduced method of thermodynamics of quantum jump trajectories . we find that the dynamics of the micromaser displays multiple space - time phase transitions , i.e. , phase transitions in ensembles of quantum jump trajectories . this rich dynamical phase structure becomes apparent when trajectories are classified by dynamical observables that quantify dynamical activity , such as the number of atoms that have changed state while traversing the cavity . the space - time transitions can be either first - order or continuous , and are controlled not just by standard parameters of the micromaser but also by non - equilibrium"counting"fields . we discuss how the dynamical phase behavior relates to the better known stationary state properties of the micromaser .
