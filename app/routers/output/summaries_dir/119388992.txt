we propose an ideal scheme for preparing vibrational $ \mathrm{su(1,1 ) } \otimes \mathrm{su(1,1)}$ states in a two - dimensional ion trap using red and blue second sideband resolved driving of two orthogonal vibrational modes . symmetric and asymmetric driving provide two regimes to realize quantum state engineering of the vibrational modes . in one regime , we show that time evolution synthesizes so - called $ \mathrm{su}(1,1)$ perelomov coherent states , that is separable squeezed states and their superposition too . the other regime allows engineering of lossless 50/50 $ \mathrm{su}(2)$ beam splitter states that are entangled states . these ideal dynamics are reversible , thus , the non - classical and entangled states produced by our schemes might be used as resources for interferometry .
