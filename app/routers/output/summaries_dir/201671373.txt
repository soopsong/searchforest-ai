a quantum system interacting with a diluted gas experiences the irreversible dynamics . the corresponding master equation can be derived within two different approaches : the fully quantum description in the low - density limit and the semiclassical collision model , where the motion of gas particles is classical whereas their internal degrees of freedom are quantum . the two approaches have been extensively studied in the literature but their predictions have not been compared . this is mainly due to a fact that the low - density limit is extensively studied for mathematical physics analysis , whereas the collision models have been essentially developed for quantum information tasks as a tractable description of the open quantum dynamics . here we develop and for the first time compare both approaches for a spin system interacting with a gas of spin particles . using some approximations , we explicitly find the corresponding master equations including the lamb shifts and the dissipators . the low density limit in the born approximation for fast particles is shown to be equivalent to the semiclassical collision model in the stroboscopic approximation . we reveal that the both approaches give exactly the same master equation if the gas temperature is high enough . this allows to interchangeably use complicated calculations in the low density limit and rather simple calculations in the collision model .
