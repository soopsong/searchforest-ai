the approach to extend the notion of entanglement for characterizing the properties of quantum correlations in the state of a single qudit is presented . new information and entropic inequalities , such as the subadditivity condition , strong subadditivity condition , and monotonicity of relative entropy for a single qudit corresponding to an arbitrary spin state with spin j are discussed . the idea to employ quantum correlations in the single - qudit state , such as the entanglement , for developing a new quantum technique in quantum computing and quantum communication is proposed . examples of qutrit and qudit with j = 3/2 are considered .
