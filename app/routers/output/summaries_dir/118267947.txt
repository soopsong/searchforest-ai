\emph{zero forcing number } , $ z(g)$ , of a graph $ g$ is the minimum cardinality of a set $ s$ of black vertices ( whereas vertices in $ v(g ) \setminus s$ are colored white ) such that $ v(g)$ is turned black after finitely many applications of"the color - change rule " : a white vertex is converted black if it is the only white neighbor of a black vertex . zero forcing number was introduced and used to bound the minimum rank of graphs by the"aim minimum rank -- special graphs work group " . let $ g_1 $ and $ g_2 $ be disjoint copies of a graph $ g$ and let $ f : v(g_1 ) \rightarrow v(g_2)$ be a function . then a \emph{functigraph } $ c(g , f)=(v , e)$ has the vertex set $ v = v(g_1 ) \cup v(g_2)$ and the edge set $ e = e(g_1 ) \cup e(g_2 ) \cup \{uv \mid v = f(u)\}$. for a connected graph $ g$ of order $ n \ge 3 $ , it is readily seen that $ 1+\delta(g ) \le z(c(g , \sigma ) ) \le n$ for any permutation $ \sigma$ ; we show that $ 1 + \delta(g ) \le z(c(g , f ) ) \le 2n-2 $ for any function $ f$ , where $ \delta(g)$ is the minimum degree of $ g$. we give examples showing that there does not exist a function $ g$ such that , for every pair $ ( g , f)$ , $ z(g)<g(z(c(g , f)))$ or $ g(z(g))>z(c(g , f))$. we further investigate the zero forcing number of functigraphs on complete graphs , on cycles , and on paths .
