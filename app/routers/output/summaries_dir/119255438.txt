we consider a quantum otto refrigerator cycle of a time - dependent harmonic oscillator . we investigate the coefficient of performance at maximum figure of merit for adiabatic and nonadiabatic frequency modulations . we obtain analytical expressions for the optimal performance both in the high - temperature ( classical ) regime and in the low - temperature ( quantum ) limit . we moreover analyze the breakdown of the cooling cycle for strongly nonadiabatic driving protocols and derive analytical estimates for the minimal driving time allowed for cooling .
