we report on the realization of silicon nitride membranes with enhanced and electrically tunable reflectivity . a subwavelength one - dimensional grating is directly patterned on a suspended 200 nm - thick , high stress commercial film using electron beam lithography . a fano resonance is observed in the transmission spectrum of tm polarized light impinging on the membrane at normal incidence , leading to an increase in its reflectivity from 10 % to 78 % at 937 nm . the observed spectrum is compared to the results of rigorous coupled wave analysis simulations based on measurements of the grating transverse profile through localized cuts of the suspended film with a focused ion beam . by mounting the membrane chip on a ring piezoelectric transducer and applying a compressive force to the substrate we subsequently observe a shift of the transmission spectrum by 0.23 nm .
