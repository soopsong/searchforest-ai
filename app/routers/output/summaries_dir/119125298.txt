it is argued that the blackhole information paradox originates from treating the blackhole geometry as strictly classical . it is further argued that the theory of quantum fields in a classical curved space with a horizon is an ill posed problem . if the geometry is allowed to fluctuate quantum mechanically , then the horizon effectively disappears . the sharp horizon emerges only in the classical limit when the ratio of the compton wavelength of the black hole to its schwarzschild radius vanishes . the region of strong gravity that develops when matter collapses to form the blackhole remains visible to the whole of spacetime and has to be described by a microscopic theory of strong gravity . the arguments imply that the information paradox is demoted from a paradox involving fundamental principles of physics to the problem of describing how matter at the highest densities gravitates .
