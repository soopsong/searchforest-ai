we study the landau - zener transitions generalized to multistate systems . based on the work by sinitsyn et al . [ phys . rev . lett . 120 , 190402 ( 2018 ) ] , we introduce the auxiliary hamiltonians that are interpreted as the counterdiabatic terms . we find that the counterdiabatic hamiltonians satisfy the zero curvature condition . the general structures of the auxiliary hamiltonians are studied in detail and the time - evolution operator is evaluated by using a deformation of the integration contour and asymptotic forms of the auxiliary hamiltonians . for several spin models with transverse field , we calculate the transition probability between the initial and final ground states and find that the method is useful to study nonadiabatic regime .
