we present experiments with bose - einstein condensates on a combined atom chip . the combined structure consists of a large - scale"carrier chip"and smaller"atom - optics chips " , containing micron - sized elements . this allows us to work with condensates very close to chip surfaces without suffering from fragmentation or losses due to thermally driven spin flips . precise three - dimensional positioning and transport with constant trap frequencies are described . bose - einstein condensates were manipulated with submicron accuracy above atom - optics chips . as an application of atom chips , a direction sensitive magnetic field microscope is demonstrated .
