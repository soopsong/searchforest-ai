we consider asymptotic convertibility of an arbitrary sequence of bipartite pure states into another by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) . we adopt an information - spectrum approach to address cases where each element of the sequences is not necessarily in tensor power of a bipartite pure state . we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the locc convertibility of one sequence to another in terms of spectral entropy rates of entanglement of the sequences . based on these results , we also provide simple proofs for previously known results on the optimal rates of entanglement concentration and dilution of general sequences of pure states .
