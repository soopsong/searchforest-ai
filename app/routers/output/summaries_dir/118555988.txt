we present an universal way to concentrate an arbitrary $ n$-particle less - entangled $ w$ state into a maximally entangled $ w$ state with different parity check gates . it comprises two protocols . the first protocol is based on the linear optical elements say the partial parity check gate and the second one uses the quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) to construct the complete parity check gate . both of which can achieve the concentration task . these protocols have several advantages . first , it can obtain a maximally entangled w state only with the help of some single photons , which greatly reduces the number of entanglement resources . second , in the first protocol , only linear optical elements are required which is feasible with current techniques . third , in the second protocol , it can be repeated to perform the concentration step and get a higher success probability . all these advantages make it be useful in current quantum communication and computation applications .
