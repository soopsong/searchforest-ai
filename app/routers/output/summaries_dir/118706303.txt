telecom photonic quantum networks with matter quantum systems enable a rich variety of applications , such as a long distance quantum cryptography and one - way quantum computing . preparation of a heralded single excitation ( hse ) in an atomic ensemble by detecting a telecom wavelength photon having a correlation with the atomic excitation is an important step . such a system has been demonstrated with a quantum frequency conversion ( qfc ) to telecom wavelength employing a rb atomic cloud . however the limited wavelength selection prevents the next step . here we for the first time demonstrate hse with a solid - state - based qfc and a detector for a telecom wavelength that will have a great advantage of the utility of mature telecom technologies . we unambiguously show that the demonstrated hse indicates a non - classical statistics by the direct measurement of the autocorrelation function .
