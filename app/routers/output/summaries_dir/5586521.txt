quantum correlation includes quantum entanglement and quantum discord . both entanglement and discord have a common necessary condition--------quantum coherence or quantum superposition . in this paper , we attempt to give an alternative understanding of how quantum correlation is related to quantum coherence . we divide the coherence of a quantum state into several classes and find the complete coincidence between geometric ( symmetric and asymmetric ) quantum discords and some particular classes of quantum coherence . we propose a revised measure for total coherence and find that this measure can lead to a symmetric version of geometric quantum correlation which is analytic for two qubits . in particular , this measure can also arrive at a monogamy equality on the distribution of quantum coherence . finally , we also quantify a remaining type of quantum coherence and find that for two qubits it is directly connected with quantum nonlocality .
