the non - gaussian operation can be used not only to enhance and distill the entanglement between gaussian entangled states , but also to improve quantum communications . in this paper , we propose an non - gaussian continuous - variable quantum key distribution ( cvqkd ) by using quantum catalysis ( qc ) , which is an intriguing non - gaussian operation in essence that can be implemented with current technologies . we perform quantum catalysis on both ends of the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pair prepared by a sender , alice , and find that for the single - photon qc - cvqkd , the bilateral symmetrical quantum catalysis ( bsqc ) performs better than the single - side quantum catalysis ( ssqc ) . attributing to characteristics of integral within an ordered product ( iwop ) of operators , we find that the quantum catalysis operation can improve the entanglement property of gaussian entangled states by enhancing the success probability of non - gaussian operation , leading to the improvement of the qc - cvqkd system . as a comparison , the qc - cvqkd system involving zero - photon and single - photon quantum catalysis outperforms the previous non - gaussian cvqkd scheme via photon subtraction in terms of secret key rate , maximal transmission distance and tolerable excess noise .
