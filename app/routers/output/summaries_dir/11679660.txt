we describe a laboratory demonstration of a quantum error correction procedure that can correct intrinsic measurement errors in linear - optics quantum gates . the procedure involves a two - qubit encoding and fast feed - forward - controlled single - qubit operations . in our demonstration the qubits were represented by the polarization states of two single - photons from a parametric down - conversion source , and the real - time feed - forward control was implemented using an electro - optic device triggered by the output of single - photon detectors .
