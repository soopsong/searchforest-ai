we present a tree - tensor - network - based method to study strongly correlated systems with nonlocal interactions in higher dimensions . although the momentum - space and quantum - chemistry versions of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method have long been applied to such systems , the spatial topology of dmrg - based methods allows efficient optimizations to be carried out with respect to one spatial dimension only . extending the matrix - product - state picture , we formulate a more general approach by allowing the local sites to be coupled to more than two neighboring auxiliary subspaces . following shi . et . al . [ phys . rev . a , 74 , 022320 ( 2006 ) ] , we treat a tree - like network ansatz with arbitrary coordination number z , where the z=2 case corresponds to the one - dimensional scheme . for this ansatz , the long - range correlation deviates from the mean - field value polynomially with distance , in contrast to the matrix - product ansatz , which deviates exponentially . the computational cost of the tree - tensor - network method is significantly smaller than that of previous dmrg - based attempts , which renormalize several blocks into a single block . in addition , we investigate the effect of unitary transformations on the local basis states and present a method for optimizing such transformations . for the 1-d interacting spinless fermion model , the optimized transformation interpolates smoothly between real space and momentum space . calculations carried out on small quantum chemical systems support our approach .
