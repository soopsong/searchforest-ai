we use a nonperturbative extended contractor renormalization ( encore ) method for engineering quantum devices for the implementation of topologically protected quantum bits described by an effective quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice . by tuning the couplings of the device , topological protection might be achieved if the ratio between effective two - dimer interactions and flip amplitudes lies in the liquid phase of the phase diagram of the quantum dimer model . for a proposal based on a quantum josephson junction array [ l. b. ioffe { \it et al . } , nature ( london ) { \bf 415 } , 503 ( 2002 ) ] our results show that optimal operational temperatures below 1 mk can only be obtained if extra interactions and dimer flips , which are not present in the standard quantum dimer model and involve three or four dimers , are included . it is unclear if these extra terms in the quantum dimer hamiltonian destroy the liquid phase needed for quantum computation . minimizing the effects of multi - dimer terms would require energy scales in the nano - kelvin regime . an alternative implementation based on cold atomic or molecular gases loaded into optical lattices is also discussed , and it is shown that the small energy scales involved -- implying long operational times -- make such a device impractical . given the many orders of magnitude between bare couplings in devices , and the topological gap , the realization of topological phases in quantum devices requires careful engineering and large bare interaction scales .
