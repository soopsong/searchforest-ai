quantum entanglement is a crucial element of establishing the entangled network structure of the quantum internet . here we define a method to achieve controlled entanglement access in the quantum internet . the proposed model defines different levels of entanglement accessibility for the users of the quantum network . the path cost is determined by an integrated criterion on the entanglement fidelities between the quantum nodes and the probabilities of entangled connections of an entangled path . we reveal the connection between the number of available entangled paths and the accessible fidelity of entanglement and reliability in the end nodes . the scheme provides an efficient model for entanglement access control in the experimental quantum internet .
