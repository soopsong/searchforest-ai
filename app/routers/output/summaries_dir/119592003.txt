we study open string configurations in rindler space suspended from d - branes at finite distance from the rindler horizon . this is a toy model for strings in the near horizon region of a black hole and has applications for the study of strings configurations of heavy quarks in the ads / cft duals of hot field theories , as well as other applications to the study of open strings ending on giant gravitons . we find that this setup produces very similar results to those that have been found in the ads black hole setup , but it is much more tractable analytically . we also comment on some quantum applications of our studies to the understanding of the spectrum of strings ending on giant gravitons .
