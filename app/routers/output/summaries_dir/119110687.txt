we study the quantum phase transition of the dicke model in the classical oscillator limit , where it occurs already for finite spin length . in contrast to the classical spin limit , for which spin - oscillator entanglement diverges at the transition , entanglement in the classical oscillator limit remains small . we derive the quantum phase transition with identical critical behavior in the two classical limits and explain the differences with respect to quantum fluctuations around the mean - field ground state through an effective model for the oscillator degrees of freedom . with numerical data for the full quantum model we study convergence to the classical limits . we contrast the classical oscillator limit with the dual limit of a high frequency oscillator , where the spin degrees of freedom are described by the lipkin - meshkov - glick model . an alternative limit can be defined for the rabi case of spin length one - half , in which spin frequency renormalization replaces the quantum phase transition .
