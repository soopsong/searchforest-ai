recent breakthroughs in solid - state photonic quantum technologies enable generating and detecting single photons with near - unity efficiency as required for a range of photonic quantum technologies . the lack of methods to simultaneously generate and control photons within the same chip , however , has formed a main obstacle to achieving efficient multi - qubit gates and to harness the advantages of chip - scale quantum photonics . here we propose and demonstrate an integrated voltage - controlled phase shifter based on the electro - optic effect in suspended photonic waveguides with embedded quantum emitters . the phase control allows building a compact mach - zehnder interferometer with two orthogonal arms , taking advantage of the anisotropic electro - optic response in gallium arsenide . photons emitted by single self - assembled quantum dots can be actively routed into the two outputs of the interferometer . these results , together with the observed sub - microsecond response time , constitute a significant step towards chip - scale single - photon - source de - multiplexing , fiber - loop boson sampling , and linear optical quantum computing .
