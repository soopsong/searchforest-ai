the solovay - kitaev theorem states that universal quantum gate sets can be exchanged with low overhead . more specifically , any gate on a fixed number of qudits can be simulated with error $ \epsilon$ using merely $ \mathrm{polylog}(1/\epsilon)$ gates from any finite universal quantum gate set $ \mathcal{g}$. one drawback to the theorem is that it requires the gate set $ \mathcal{g}$ to be closed under inversion . here we show that this restriction can be traded for the assumption that $ \mathcal{g}$ contains an irreducible representation of any finite group $ g$. this extends recent work of sardharwalla et al . [ arxiv:1602.07963 ] , and applies also to gates from the special linear group . our work can be seen as partial progress towards the long - standing open problem of proving an inverse - free solovay - kitaev theorem [ arxiv : quant - ph/0505030 , arxiv:0908.0512 ] .
