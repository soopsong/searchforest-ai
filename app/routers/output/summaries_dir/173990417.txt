operator scrambling denotes the evolution of a simple operator into a complicated one ( in the heisenberg picture ) , which characterizes quantum chaos in many - body systems . more specifically , a simple operator evolves into a linear superposition of many operators , most of which are many - body operators supported on a region of size much larger than $ 1$. in general , an operator does not have a definite size but is characterized by a probability distribution of size . the operator size is related to out - of - time - order correlation functions , but these are generically difficult to obtain from experimental observables . in this paper we show that the operator size distribution can be measured in quantum quench experiments . in a quantum spin system , we propose to prepare an ensemble of initial states which are direct product states of random pure states of each spin qudit , and measure a simple physical observable ( such as a particular component of spin ) at later time $ t$. the initial state dependence of the expectation value measures a particular component of the operator size distribution . furthermore , many other features of the operator size distribution can be measured by analyzing the same data , such as the support of the operator in space .
