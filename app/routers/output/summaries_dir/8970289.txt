this paper defines the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel as the maximum squashed entanglement that can be registered by a sender and receiver at the input and output of a quantum channel , respectively . a new subadditivity inequality for the original squashed entanglement measure of christandl and winter leads to the conclusion that the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel is an additive function of a tensor product of any two quantum channels . more importantly , this new subadditivity inequality , along with prior results of christandl , winter , et al . , establishes the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel as an upper bound on the quantum communication capacity of any channel assisted by unlimited forward and backward classical communication . a similar proof establishes this quantity as an upper bound on the private capacity of a quantum channel assisted by unlimited forward and backward public classical communication . this latter result is relevant as a limitation on rates achievable in quantum key distribution . as an important application , we determine that these capacities can never exceed log((1+eta)/(1-eta ) ) for a pure - loss bosonic channel for which a fraction eta of the input photons make it to the output on average . the best known lower bound on these capacities is equal to log(1/(1-eta ) ) . thus , in the high - loss regime for which eta<<1 , this new upper bound demonstrates that the protocols corresponding to the above lower bound are nearly optimal .
