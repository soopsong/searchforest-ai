new quantum computing architectures consider integrating qubits as sensors to provide actionable information useful for decoherence mitigation on neighboring data qubits , but little work has addressed how such schemes may be efficiently implemented in order to maximize information utilization . techniques from classical estimation and dynamic control , suitably adapted to the strictures of quantum measurement , provide an opportunity to extract augmented hardware performance through automation of low - level characterization and control . in this work , we present an autonomous learning framework , noise mapping for quantum architectures ( nmqa ) , for adaptive scheduling of sensor - qubit measurements and efficient spatial noise mapping ( prior to actuation ) across device architectures . via a two - layer particle filter , nmqa receives binary measurements and determines regions within the architecture that share common noise processes ; an adaptive controller then schedules future measurements to reduce map uncertainty . numerical analysis and experiments on an array of trapped ytterbium ions demonstrate that nmqa outperforms brute - force mapping by up - to $ 18$x ( $ 3$x ) in simulations ( experiments ) , calculated as a reduction in the number of measurements required to map a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field with a target error metric . as an early adaptation of robotic control to quantum devices , this work opens up exciting new avenues in quantum computer science .
