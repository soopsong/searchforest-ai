we formulate some properties of a set of several mutually unbiased measurements . these properties are used for deriving entropic uncertainty relations . applications of mutually unbiased measurements in entanglement detection are also revisited . first , we estimate from above the sum of the indices of coincidence for several mutually unbiased measurements . further , we derive entropic uncertainty relations in terms of the r\'{e}nyi and tsallis entropies . both the state - dependent and state - independent formulations are obtained . using the two sets of local mutually unbiased measurements , a method of entanglement detection in bipartite finite - dimensional systems may be realized . a certain trade - off between a sensitivity of the scheme and its experimental complexity is discussed .
