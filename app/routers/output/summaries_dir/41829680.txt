we study optomechanical interactions in non - hermitian photonic molecules that support two photonic states and one acoustic mode . the nonlinear steady - state solutions and their linear stability landscapes are investigated as a function of the system 's parameters and excitation power levels . we also examine the temporal evolution of the system and uncover different regimes of nonlinear dynamics . our analysis reveals several important results : ( 1 ) parity - time ( $ \mathcal{pt}$ ) symmetry is not necessarily the optimum choice for maximum optomechanical interaction . ( 2 ) stable steady - state solutions are not always reached under continuous wave ( cw ) optical excitations . ( 3 ) accounting for gain saturation effects can regulate the behavior of the otherwise unbounded oscillation amplitudes . our study provides a deeper insight into the interplay between optical non - hermiticity and optomechanical coupling and can thus pave the way for new device applications .
