we consider the construction of local bulk operators in a black hole background dual to a pure state in conformal field theory . the properties of these operators in a microcanonical ensemble are studied . it has been argued in the literature that typical states in such an ensemble contain firewalls , or otherwise singular horizons . we argue this conclusion can be avoided with a proper definition of the interior operators .
