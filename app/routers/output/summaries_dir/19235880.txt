the nonunity quantum efficiency ( qe ) in photodiodes ( pd ) causes deterioration of signal quality in quantum optical experiments due to photocurrent loss as well as the introduction of vacuum fluctuations into the measurement . in this paper , we report that the external qe enhancement of a pd was demonstrated by recycling the reflected photons . the external qe for an ingaas pd was increased by 0.01 - 0.06 from 0.86 - 0.92 over a wide range of incident angles . moreover , we confirmed that this technique does not increase backscattered light when the recycled beam is properly misaligned .
