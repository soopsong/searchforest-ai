we develop a method to study quantum impurity models , small interacting quantum systems linearly coupled to an environment , in presence of an additional markovian quantum bath , with a generic non - linear coupling to the impurity . we aim at computing the evolution operator of the reduced density matrix of the impurity , obtained after tracing out all the environmental degrees of freedom . first , we derive an exact real - time hybridization expansion for this quantity , which generalizes the result obtained in absence of the additional markovian dissipation , and which could be amenable to stochastic sampling through diagrammatic monte carlo . then , we obtain a dyson equation for this quantity and we evaluate its self - energy with a resummation technique known as the non - crossing - approximation . we apply this novel approach to a simple fermionic impurity coupled to a zero temperature fermionic bath and in presence of markovian pump , losses and dephasing .
