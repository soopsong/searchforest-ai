finite group extensions offer a natural language to quantum computing . in a nutshell , one roughly describes the action of a quantum computer as consisting of two finite groups of gates : error gates from the general pauli group p and stabilizing gates within an extension group c. in this paper one explores the nice adequacy between group theoretical concepts such as commutators , normal subgroups , group of automorphisms , short exact sequences , wreath products ... and the coherent quantum computational primitives . the structure of the single qubit and two - qubit clifford groups is analyzed in detail . as a byproduct , one discovers that m20 , the smallest perfect group for which the commutator subgroup departs from the set of commutators , underlies quantum coherence of the two - qubit system . one recovers similar results by looking at the automorphisms of a complete set of mutually unbiased bases .
