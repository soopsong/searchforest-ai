we study the canonical and the coherent state quantization of a particle moving in a magnetic field on a non - commutative plane . starting from the so called \theta - modified action , we perform the canonical quantization and analyze the gauge dependence of the obtained quantum theory . we construct the malkin - man'ko coherent states of the system in question , and the corresponding quantization . on this base , we study the relation between the coherent states and the"classical"trajectories predicted by the \theta - modified action . in addition , we construct different semiclassical states , making use of special properties of circular squeezed states . with the help of these states , we perform the berezin - klauder - toeplitz quantization and present a numerical exploration of the semiclassical behavior of physical quantities in these states .
