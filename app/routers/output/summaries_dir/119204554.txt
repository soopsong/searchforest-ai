a general method is introduced for verifying multitime quantum correlations through the characteristic function of the time - dependent p functional that generalizes the glauber - sudarshan p function . quantum correlation criteria are derived which identify quantum effects for an arbitrary number of points in time . the magnus expansion is used to visualize the impact of the required time ordering , which becomes crucial in situations when the interaction problem is explicitly time dependent . we show that the latter affects the multi - time - characteristic function and , therefore , the temporal evolution of the nonclassicality . as an example , we apply our technique to an optical parametric process with a frequency mismatch . the resulting two - time - characteristic function yields full insight into the two - time quantum correlation properties of such a system .
