a typical bipartite quantum protocol , such as epr - steering , relies on two quantum features , entanglement of states and incompatibility of measurements . noise can delete both of these quantum features . in this work we study the behavior of incompatibility under noisy quantum channels . the starting point for our investigation is the observation that compatible measurements can not become incompatible by the action of any channel . we focus our attention to channels which completely destroy the incompatibility of various relevant sets of measurements . we call such channels incompatibility breaking , in analogy to the concept of entanglement breaking channels . this notion is relevant especially for the understanding of noise - robustness of the local measurement resources for steering .
