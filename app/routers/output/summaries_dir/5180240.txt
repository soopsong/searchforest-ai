the transfer of quantum entanglement ( or quantum coherence ) is not only fundamental in quantum mechanics but also important in quantum information processing . we here propose a way to achieve the coherent transfer of $ w$-class entangled states of qubits among different cavities . because no photon is excited in each cavity , decoherence caused by the photon decay is suppressed during the transfer . in addition , only one coupler qubit and one operational step are needed and no classical pulses are used in this proposal , thus the engineering complexity is much reduced and the operation is greatly simplified . we further give a numerical analysis , showing that high - fidelity transfer of a three - qubit $ w$ state is feasible within the present circuit qed technique . the proposal can be applied to a wide range of physical implementation with various qubits such as quantum dots , nitrogen - vacancy centers , atoms , and superconducting qubits .
