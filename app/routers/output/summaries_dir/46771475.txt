in this paper we investigate the ground - state properties and related quantum phase transitions for the two - component bose - einstein condensate in a single - mode optical cavity . apart from the usual normal and superradiant phases multi - stable macroscopic quantum states are realized by means of the spin - coherent - state variational method . we demonstrate analytically the stimulated radiation from collective state of atomic population inversion , which does not exist in the normal dicke model with single - component atoms . it is also revealed that the stimulated radiation can be generated only from one component of atoms and the other remains in the ordinary superradiant state . however the order of superradiant and stimulatedradiation states is interchangeable between two components of atoms by tuning the relative atom - field couplings and the frequency detuning as well .
