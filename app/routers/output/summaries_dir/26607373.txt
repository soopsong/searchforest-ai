we propose a scheme to create distant entangled atomic states . it is based on driving two ( or more ) atoms with a weak laser pulse , so that the probability that two atoms are excited is negligible . if the subsequent spontaneous emission is detected , the entangled state is created . we have developed a model to analyze the fidelity of the resulting state as a function of the dimensions and location of the detector , and the motional properties of the atoms .
