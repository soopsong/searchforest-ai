experimentally observed quantum few - body dynamics of neutral atoms excited to a rydberg state are numerically analyzed with lindblad master equation formalism . for this , up to five rubidium atoms are trapped with optical tweezers , arranged in various two - dimensional configurations , and excited to rydberg 67s state in the nearest - neighbor blockade regime . their coherent evolutions are measured with time - varying ground - state projections . the experimental results are analyzed with a model lindblad equation with the homogeneous and inhomogeneous dampings determined by systematic and statistical error analysis . the coherent evolutions of the entangled systems are successfully reproduced by the resulting model analysis for the experimental results with optimal parameters in consistent with external calibrations .
