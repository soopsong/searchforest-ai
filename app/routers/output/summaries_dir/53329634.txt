we propose to construct large quantum graph codes by means of superconducting circuits working at the ultrastrong coupling regime . in this physical scenario , we are able to create a cluster state between any pair of qubits within a fraction of a nanosecond . to exemplify our proposal , creation of the five - qubit and steane codes is numerically simulated . we also provide optimal operating conditions with which the graph codes can be realized with state - of - the - art superconducting technologies .
