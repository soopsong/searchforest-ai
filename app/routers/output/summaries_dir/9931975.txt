reasoned by its dynamical behavior , the memristor enables a lot of new applications in analog circuit design . since some realizations are shown ( e.g. 2007 by hewlett packard ) , the development of applications with memristors becomes more and more interesting . whereas most of the research was done in the direction of memristor applications in neural networks and storage devices , less publications deal with practical applications of analog memristive circuits . but this topic is also promising further applications . therefore , this article proposes a frequency dependent rectifier memristor bridge for different purposes ( e.g. using as a programmable synaptic membrane voltage generator for spike - time - dependent - plasticity ) and describes the circuit theory . in this context it is shown that the picard iteration is one possibility to solve the system of nonlinear state equations of memristor circuits analytically . an intuitive picture of how a memristor works in a network in general is given as well . in this context some research on the dynamical behavior of a hp memristor should be done .
