quantum state engineering is a central task in lyapunov - based quantum control . given different initial states , better performance may be achieved if the control parameters , such as the lyapunov function , are individually optimized for each initial state , however , at the expense of computing resources . to tackle this issue , we propose an initial - state - adaptive lyapunov control strategy with machine learning , specifically , artificial neural networks trained through supervised learning . two designs are presented and illustrated where the feedforward neural network and the general regression neural network are used to select control schemes and design lyapunov functions , respectively . since the sample generation and the training of neural networks are carried out in advance , the initial - state - adaptive lyapunov control can be implemented without much increase of computational resources .
