optimal wavelength assignment in dense - wavelength - division - multiplexing ( dwdm ) systems that integrate both quantum and classical channels is studied . in such systems , weak quantum key distribution ( qkd ) signals travel alongside intense classical signals on the same fiber , where the former can be masked by the background noise induced by the latter . here , we investigate how optimal wavelength assignment can mitigate this problem . we consider different dwdm structures and various sources of crosstalk and propose several near - optimal wavelength assignment methods that maximize the total secret key rate of the qkd channels . our numerical results show that the optimum wavelength assignment pattern is commonly consisted of several interspersed quantum and classical bands . using our proposed techniques , the total secret key rate of quantum channels can substantially be improved , as compared to conventional assignment methods , in the noise dominated regimes . alternatively , we can maximize the number of qkd users supported under certain key rate constraints .
