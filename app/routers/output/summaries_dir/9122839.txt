the experimental observation of quantum phenomena in strongly correlated many particle systems is difficult because of the short length - and timescales involved . obtaining at the same time detailed control of individual constituents appears even more challenging and thus to date inhibits employing such systems as quantum information processing devices . substantial progress has been achieved with josephson junction arrays and cold atoms in optical lattices , where a detailed control of collective properties is feasible . however it is very difficult to address and hence control or measure individual sites .
