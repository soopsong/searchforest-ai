the representation of quantum states via phase - space functions constitutes an intuitive technique to characterize light . however , the reconstruction of such distributions is challenging as it demands specific types of detectors and detailed models thereof to account for their particular properties and imperfections . to overcome these obstacles , we derive and implement a measurement scheme that enables a reconstruction of phase - space distributions whose functionality does not depend on the knowledge of the detectors , thus defining the notion of detector - agnostic phase - space distributions . our theory presents a generalization of well - known phase - space quasiprobability distributions , such as the wigner function . we implement our measurement protocol , using transition - edge sensors without performing a detector characterization . based on our approach , we reveal the characteristic features of heralded single- and two - photon states in phase space and certify their nonclassicality with high statistical significance .
