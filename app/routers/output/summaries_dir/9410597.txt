we study photon correlations generated by scattering from three - level systems ( 3ls ) in one dimension . the two systems studied are a 3ls in a semi - infinite waveguide ( 3ls plus a mirror ) and two 3ls in an infinite waveguide ( double 3ls ) . our two - photon scattering approach naturally connects photon correlation effects with inelastically scattered photons ; it corresponds to input - output theory in the weak - probe limit . at the resonance where electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) occurs , we find that no photons are scattered inelastically and hence there are no induced correlations . slightly away from eit , the total inelastically scattered flux is large , being substantially enhanced due to the additional interference paths . this enhancement carries over to the two - photon correlation function , which exhibits non - classical behavior such as strong bunching with a very long time - scale . the long time scale originates from the slow - light effect associated with eit .
