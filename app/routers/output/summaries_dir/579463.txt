a recommendation system uses the past purchases or ratings of $ n$ products by a group of $ m$ users , in order to provide personalized recommendations to individual users . the information is modeled as an $ m \times n$ preference matrix which is assumed to have a good rank-$k$ approximation , for a small constant $ k$. in this work , we present a quantum algorithm for recommendation systems that has running time $ o(\text{poly}(k)\text{polylog}(mn))$. all known classical algorithms for recommendation systems that work through reconstructing an approximation of the preference matrix run in time polynomial in the matrix dimension . our algorithm provides good recommendations by sampling efficiently from an approximation of the preference matrix , without reconstructing the entire matrix . for this , we design an efficient quantum procedure to project a given vector onto the row space of a given matrix . this is the first algorithm for recommendation systems that runs in time polylogarithmic in the dimensions of the matrix and provides an example of a quantum machine learning algorithm for a real world application .
