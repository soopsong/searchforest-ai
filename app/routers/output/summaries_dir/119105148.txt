we consider the nonstationary circuit qed architecture , where a single artificial two - level atom interacts with a cavity field mode under external modulation of one or more system parameters . two different approaches are employed to study the effects of markovian dissipation on modulation - induced transitions between the atom - field dressed states : the standard master equation of quantum optics and the recently formulated dressed - picture master equation . we estimate the associated transition rates and show that photon generation from vacuum ( " dynamical casimir effect " , dce ) and coherent photon annihilation from nonvacuum states ( " anti - dce " ) are possible with the current state - of - the - art parameters .
