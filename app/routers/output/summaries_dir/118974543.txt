we consider an n ->m quantum cloning transformation acting on pure two - level states lying on the equator of the bloch sphere . an upper bound for its fidelity is presented , by establishing a connection between optimal phase covariant cloning and phase estimation . we give the explicit form of a cloning transformation that achieves the bound for the case n=1 , m=2 , and find a link between this case and optimal eavesdropping in the quantum cryptographic scheme bb84 .
