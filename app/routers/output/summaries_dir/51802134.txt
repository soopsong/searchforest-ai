informationally complete measurements are a dramatic discovery of quantum information science , and the symmetric ic measurements , known as sics , are in many ways optimal among them . close study of three of the"sporadic sics"reveals an illuminating relation between different ways of quantifying the extent to which quantum theory deviates from classical expectations .
