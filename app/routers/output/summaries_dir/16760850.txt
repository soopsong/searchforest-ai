an important step in building a quantum computer is calibrating experimentally implemented quantum gates to produce operations that are close to ideal unitaries . the calibration step involves estimating the systematic errors in gates and then using controls to correct the implementation . quantum process tomography is a standard technique for estimating these errors , but is both time consuming , ( when one only wants to learn a few key parameters ) , and is usually inaccurate without resources like perfect state preparation and measurement , which might not be available . with the goal of efficiently and accurately estimating specific errors using minimal resources , we develop a parameter estimation technique , which can gauge key systematic parameters ( specifically , amplitude and off - resonance errors ) in a universal single - qubit gate - set with provable robustness and efficiency . in particular , our estimates achieve the optimal efficiency , heisenberg scaling , and do so without entanglement and entirely within a single - qubit hilbert space . our main theorem making this possible is a robust version of the phase estimation procedure of higgins et al .
