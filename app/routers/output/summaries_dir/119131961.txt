in this work , we consider the bilinear schr\"odinger equation ( \ref{mainx1 } ) $ i\dd_t\psi=-\delta\psi+u(t)b\psi$ in the hilbert space $ l^2(\gi,\c)$ with $ \gi$ an infinite graph . the laplacian $ -\delta$ is equipped with self - adjoint boundary conditions , $ b$ is a bounded symmetric operator and $ u\in l^2((0,t),\r)$ with $ t>0$. we study the well - posedness of the ( \ref{mainx1 } ) in suitable subspaces of $ d(|\delta|^{3/2})$ preserved by the dynamics despite the dispersive behaviour of the equation . in such spaces , we study the global exact controllability and the { \virgolette{energetic controllability } } . we provide examples involving for instance infinite tadpole graphs .
