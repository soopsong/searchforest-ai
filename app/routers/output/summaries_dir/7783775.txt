recently , hassanpour and houshmand have proposed a protocol of controlled deterministic secure quantum communication ( quant . info . process , doi 10.1007 / s11128 - 014 - 0866-z ( 2014 ) ) . the authors compared the efficiency of their protocol with that of two other existing protocols and claimed that their protocol is efficient . here , we have shown that the efficiency of hassanpour houshmand ( hh ) protocol is not high , and there exist several approaches through which more efficient protocols for the same task can be designed . to establish this point , we have proposed an efficient protocol of controlled deterministic secure quantum communication which is based on permutation of particles ( pop ) technique and is considerably efficient compared to hh protocol . we have also generalized this protocol into its bidirectional counterpart . interestingly , bipartite entanglement ( bell state ) is sufficient for the realization of the proposed protocols , but hh protocol and other existing protocols require at least tripartite entanglement . further , we have shown that it is possible to construct a large number of efficient protocols of unidirectional and bidirectional controlled deterministic secure quantum communication by using various alternative approaches and different quantum states . these alternative protocols can be realized by modifying the existing protocols of quantum secure direct communication and deterministic secure quantum communication . we have also shown that it is possible to design completely orthogonal - state - based protocols for unidirectional and bidirectional controlled deterministic secure quantum communication .
