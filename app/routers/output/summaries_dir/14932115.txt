we analyze the back - action influence of nuclear spins on the motion of the cantilever of a magnetic force resonance microscope . we calculate the contribution of nuclear spins to the damping and frequency shift of the cantilever . we show that , at the rabi frequency , the energy exchange between the cantilever and the spin system cools or heats the cantilever depending on the sign of the high - frequency detuning . we also show that the spin noise leads to a significant damping of the cantilever motion .
