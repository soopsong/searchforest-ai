we demonstrate the generation of quantum - correlated photon - pairs combined with the spectral filtering of the pump field by more than 95db using bragg reflectors and electrically tunable ring resonators . moreover , we perform demultiplexing and routing of signal and idler photons after transferring them via a fiber to a second identical chip . non - classical two - photon temporal correlations with a coincidence - to - accidental ratio of 50 are measured without further off - chip filtering . our system , fabricated with high yield and reproducibility in a cmos process , paves the way toward truly large - scale quantum photonic circuits by allowing sources and detectors of single photons to be integrated on the same chip .
