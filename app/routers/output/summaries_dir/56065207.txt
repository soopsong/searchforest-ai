we elaborate on the recent claim [ arxiv:1702.03583 ] that non - perturbative effects in $ \alpha'$ , which are at the core of the fzz duality , render the region just behind the horizon of the $ sl(2,\mathbb{r})_k / u(1)$ black hole singular already at the classical level ( $ g_s=0 $ ) . we argue that the 2d classical $ sl(2,\mathbb{r})_k / u(1)$ black hole could shed some light on quantum black holes in higher dimensions including large black holes in $ ads_5\times s^5$.
