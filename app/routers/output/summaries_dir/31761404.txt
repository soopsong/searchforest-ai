the counterfactuality of recently proposed protocols is analyzed . a definition of ` counterfactuality ' is offered and it is argued that an interaction - free measurement of the presence of an opaque object can be named ` counterfactual ' , while proposed"counterfactual"measurements of the absence of such objects are not counterfactual . the quantum key distribution protocols which rely only on measurements of the presence of the object are counterfactual , but quantum direct communication protocols are not . therefore , the name ` counterfactual ' is not appropriate for recent"counterfactual"protocols which transfer quantum states by quantum direct communication .
