as the generation of squeezed states of light has become a standard technique in laboratories , attention is increasingly directed towards adapting the optical parameters of squeezed beams to the specific requirements of individual applications . it is known that imaging , metrology , and quantum information may benefit from using squeezed light with a tailored transverse spatial mode . however , experiments have so far been limited to generating only a few squeezed spatial modes within a given setup . here , we present the generation of single - mode squeezing in laguerre - gauss and bessel - gauss modes , as well as an arbitrary intensity pattern , all from a single setup using a spatial light modulator ( slm ) . the degree of squeezing obtained is limited mainly by the initial squeezing and diffractive losses introduced by the slm , while no excess noise from the slm is detectable at the measured sideband . the experiment illustrates the single - mode concept in quantum optics and demonstrates the viability of current slms as flexible tools for the spatial reshaping of squeezed light .
