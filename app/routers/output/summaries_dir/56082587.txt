we report an accelerated laser phase diffusion quantum entropy source with all non - laser optical and optoelectronic elements implemented in silicon photonics . the device uses efficient and robust single - laser accelerated phase diffusion methods , and implements the whole quantum entropy source scheme including an unbalanced mach - zehnder interferometer with optimized splitting ratio , in a 0.5 mmx1 mm footprint . we demonstrate gbps raw entropy - generation rates in a technology compatible with conventional cmos fabrication techniques .
