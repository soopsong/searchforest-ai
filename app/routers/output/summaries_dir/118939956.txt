the entanglement entropy of the ground state of a quantum lattice model with local interactions usually satisfies an area law . however , in 1d systems some violations may appear in inhomogeneous systems or in random systems . in our inhomogeneous system , the inhomogeneity parameter , $ h$ , allows us to tune different regimes where a volumetric violation of the area law appears . we apply the strong disorder renormalization group to describe the maximally entangled state of the system in a strong inhomogeneity regime . moreover , in a weak inhomogeneity regime , we use a continuum approximation to describe the state as a thermo - field double in a conformal field theory with an effective temperature which is proportional to the inhomogeneity parameter of the system . the latter description also shows that the universal scaling features of this model are captured by a massless dirac fermion in a curved space - time with constant negative curvature $ r=-h^2 $ , providing another example of the relation between quantum entanglement and space - time geometry . the results we discuss here were already published before , but here we present a more didactic exposure of basic concepts of the rainbow system for the students attending the latin american school of physics marcos moshinsky 2017 .
