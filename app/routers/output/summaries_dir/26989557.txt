the nonlinearity exhibited by the kinetic inductance of a superconducting stripline couples stripline resonator modes together in a manner suitable for quantum non - demolition measurement of the number of photons in a given resonator mode . quantum non - demolition measurement is accomplished by coherently driving another resonator mode , referred to as the detector mode , and measuring its response . we show that the sensitivity of such a detection scheme is directly related to the dephasing rate induced by such an intermode coupling . we show that high sensitivity is expected when the detector mode is driven into the nonlinear regime and operated close to a point where critical slowing down occurs .
