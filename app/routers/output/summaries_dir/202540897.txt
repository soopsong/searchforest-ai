dynamical quantum phase transitions ( dqpts ) represent a counterpart in non - equilibrium quantum time evolution of thermal phase transitions at equilibrium , where real time becomes analogous to a control parameter such as temperature . in quenched quantum systems , recently the occurrence of dqpts has been demonstrated , both with theory and experiment , to be intimately connected to changes of topological properties . here , we contribute to broadening the systematic understanding of this relation between topology and dqpts to multi - orbital and disordered systems . specifically , we provide a detailed ergodicity analysis to derive criteria for dqpts in all spatial dimensions , and construct basic counter - examples to the occurrence of dqpts in multi - band topological insulator models . as a numerical case study illustrating our results , we report on microscopic simulations of the quench dynamics in the harper - hofstadter model . furthermore , going gradually from multi - band to disordered systems , we approach random disorder by increasing the ( super ) unit cell within which random perturbations are switched on adiabatically . this leads to an intriguing order of limits problem which we address by extensive numerical calculations on quenched one - dimensional topological insulators and superconductors with disorder .
