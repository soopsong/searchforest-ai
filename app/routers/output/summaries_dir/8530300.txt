we derive a set of design guidelines and a figure of merit to aid the engineering process of on - chip waveguides for strong stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) . to this end , we examine the impact of several types of loss on the total amplification of the stokes wave that can be achieved via sbs . we account for linear loss and nonlinear loss of third order ( two - photon absorption , 2pa ) and fifth order , most notably 2pa - induced free carrier absorption ( fca ) . from this , we derive an upper bound for the output power of continuous - wave brillouin - lasers and show that the optimal operating conditions and maximal realisable stokes amplification of any given waveguide structure are determined by a dimensionless parameter $ \mathcal{f}$ involving the sbs - gain and all loss parameters . we provide simple expressions for optimal pump power , waveguide length and realisable amplification and demonstrate their utility in two example systems . notably , we find that 2pa - induced fca is a serious limitation to sbs in silicon and germanium for wavelengths shorter than 2200 nm and 3600 nm , respectively . in contrast , three - photon absorption is of no practical significance .
