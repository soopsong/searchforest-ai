in this paper , claims by lemmens and seidel in 1973 about equiangular sets of lines with angle $ 1/5 $ are proved by carefully analyzing pillar decompositions , with the aid of the uniqueness of two - graphs on $ 276 $ vertices . the neumann theorem is generalized in the sense that if there are more than $ 2r-2 $ equiangular lines in $ \mathbb{r}^r$ , then the angle is quite restricted . together with techniques on finding saturated equiangular sets , we determine the maximum size of equiangular sets"exactly"in an $ r$-dimensional euclidean space for $ r = 8 $ , $ 9 $ , and $ 10$.
