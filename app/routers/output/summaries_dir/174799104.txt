in this work we seek to generalize the connection between traversable wormholes and quantum channels . we do this via a connection between traversable wormholes and graph geometries on which we can perform quantum random walks for signal transmission . as a proof of principle , we give an example of a geometry for which quantum random walk signal traversal occurs exponentially faster than a standard ballistic classical traversal . we then generalize this connection to superpositions over holographic states , and argue that the quantum random walk / graph geometry picture works to study quantum channel properties of such states .
