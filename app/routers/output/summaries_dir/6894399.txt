quantum repeater is one of the important building blocks for long distance quantum communication network . the previous quantum repeaters based on atomic ensembles and linear optical elements can only be performed with a maximal success probability of 1/2 during the entanglement creation and entanglement swapping procedures . meanwhile , the polarization noise during the entanglement distribution process is harmful to the entangled channel created . here we introduce a general interface between a polarized photon and an atomic ensemble trapped in a single - sided optical cavity , and with which we propose a high - efficiency quantum repeater protocol in which the robust entanglement distribution is accomplished by the stable spatial - temporal entanglement and it can in principle create the deterministic entanglement between neighboring atomic ensembles in a heralded way as a result of cavity quantum electrodynamics . meanwhile , the simplified parity check gate makes the entanglement swapping be completed with unity efficiency , other than 1/2 with linear optics . we detail the performance of our protocol with current experimental parameters and show its robustness to the imperfections , i.e. , detuning and coupling variation , involved in the reflection process . these good features make it a useful building block in long distance quantum communication .
