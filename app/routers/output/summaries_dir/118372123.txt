an essential element of classical computation is the"if - then"construct , that accepts a control bit and an arbitrary gate , and provides conditional execution of the gate depending on the value of the controlling bit . on the other hand , quantum theory prevents the existence of an analogous universal construct accepting a control qubit and an arbitrary quantum gate as its input . nevertheless , there are controllable sets of quantum gates for which such a construct exists . here we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a set of unitary transformations to be controllable , and we give a complete characterization of controllable sets in the two dimensional case . this result reveals an interesting connection between the problem of controllability and the problem of extracting information from an unknown quantum gate while using it .
