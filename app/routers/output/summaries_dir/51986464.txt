we study the nonlinear dynamics of trapped - ion models far away from the lamb - dicke regime . this nonlinearity induces a sideband cooling blockade , stopping the propagation of quantum information along the hilbert space of the jaynes - cummings and quantum rabi models . we compare the linear and nonlinear cases of these models in the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes . moreover , we propose a scheme that simulates the nonlinear quantum rabi model in all coupling regimes . this can be done via off - resonant nonlinear red and blue sideband interactions , yielding applications as a dynamical quantum filter .
