we propose and study a realistic model for the decoherence of topological qubits , based on majorana fermions in one - dimensional topological superconductors . the source of decoherence is the fluctuating charge on a capacitively coupled gate , modeled by non - interacting electrons . in this context , we clarify the role of quantum fluctuations and thermal fluctuations and find that quantum fluctuations do not lead to decoherence , while thermal fluctuations do . we explicitly calculate decay times due to thermal noise and give conditions for the gap size in the topological superconductor and the gate temperature . based on this result , we provide simple rules for gate geometries and materials optimized for reducing the negative effect of thermal charge fluctuations on the gate .
