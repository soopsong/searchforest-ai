the ability to coherently convert the frequency and temporal waveform of single and entangled photons will be crucial to interconnect the various elements of future quantum information networks . of particular importance in this context is the quantum frequency conversion of photons emitted by material systems able to store quantum information , so called quantum memories . there have been significant efforts to implement quantum frequency conversion using non linear crystals , with non classical light from broadband photon pair sources and solid state emitters . however , so far , solid state quantum frequency conversion has not been achieved with long lived optical quantum memories . here , we demonstrate an ultra low noise solid state photonic quantum interface suitable for connecting quantum memories based on atomic ensembles to the telecommunication fiber network . the interface is based on an integrated waveguide non linear device . as a proof of principle , we convert heralded single photons at 780 nm emitted by a rubidium based quantum memory to the telecommunication wavelength of 1552 nm . we demonstrate a significant amount of non classical correlations between the converted photon and the heralding signal .
