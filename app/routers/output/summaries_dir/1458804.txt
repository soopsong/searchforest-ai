we study the statistical monotonicity of the scalar curvature for the alpha - geometries on the simplex of probability vectors . from the results obtained and from numerical data we are led to some conjectures about quantum alpha - geometries and wigner - yanase - dyson information . finally we show that this last conjecture implies the truth of the petz conjecture about the monotonicity of the scalar curvature of the bogoliubov - kubo - mori monotone metric .
