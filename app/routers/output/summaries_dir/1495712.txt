this paper is concerned with a translation invariant network of identical quantum stochastic systems subjected to external quantum noise . each node of the network is directly coupled to a finite number of its neighbours . this network is modelled as an open quantum harmonic oscillator and is governed by a set of linear quantum stochastic differential equations . the dynamic variables of the network satisfy the canonical commutation relations . similar large - scale networks can be found , for example , in quantum metamaterials and optical lattices . using spatial fourier transform techniques , we obtain a sufficient condition for stability of the network in the case of finite interaction range , and consider a mean square performance index for the stable network in the thermodynamic limit . the peres - horodecki - simon separability criterion is employed in order to obtain sufficient and necessary conditions for quantum entanglement of bipartite systems of nodes of the network in the gaussian invariant state . the results on stability and entanglement are extended to the infinite chain of the linear quantum systems by letting the number of nodes go to infinity . a numerical example is provided to illustrate the results .
