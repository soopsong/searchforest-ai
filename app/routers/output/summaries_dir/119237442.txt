the problem of identifiability of model parameters for open quantum systems is considered by investigating two - level dephasing systems . we discuss under which conditions full information about the hamiltonian and dephasing parameters can be obtained . using simulated experiments several different strategies for extracting model parameters from limited and noisy data are compared .
