the purpose of this paper is to solve a fault tolerant filtering and fault detection problem for a class of open quantum systems driven by a continuous - mode bosonic input field in single photon states when the systems are subject to stochastic faults . optimal estimates of both the system observables and the fault process are simultaneously calculated and characterized by a set of coupled recursive quantum stochastic differential equations .
