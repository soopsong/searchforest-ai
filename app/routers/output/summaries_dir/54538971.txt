we present a probabilistic quantum processor for qudits . the processor itself is represented by a fixed array of gates . the input of the processor consists of two registers . in the program register the set of instructions ( program ) is encoded . this program is applied to the data register . the processor can perform any operation on a single qudit of the dimension n with a certain probability . if the operation is unitary , the probability is in general 1 / n^2 , but for more restricted sets of operators the probability can be higher . in fact , this probability can be independent of the dimension of the qudit hilbert space of the qudit under some conditions .
