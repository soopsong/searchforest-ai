we characterize the distillation of quantum coherence in the one - shot setting , that is , the conversion of general quantum states into maximally coherent states under different classes of quantum operations . we show that the maximally incoherent operations ( mio ) and the dephasing - covariant incoherent operations ( dio ) have the same power in the task of one - shot coherence distillation . we establish that the one - shot distillable coherence under mio and dio is efficiently computable with a semidefinite program , which we show to correspond to a quantum hypothesis testing problem . further , we introduce a family of coherence monotones generalizing the robustness of coherence as well as the modified trace distance of coherence , and show that they admit an operational interpretation in characterizing the fidelity of distillation under different classes of operations . by providing an explicit formula for these quantities for pure states , we show that the one - shot distillable coherence under mio , dio , strictly incoherent operations ( sio ) , and incoherent operations ( io ) is equal for all pure states .
