in recent years the study of topological phases of matter has emerged as a very exciting field of research , both in photonics and in electronics . however , up to now the electronic and photonic properties have been regarded as totally independent . here , we establish a link between the electronic and the photonic topological phases of the same material system and theoretically demonstrate that they are intimately related . we propose a realization of the haldane model as a patterned 2d electron gas and determine its optical response using the kubo formula . it is shown that the electronic and photonic phase diagrams of the patterned electron gas are strictly related . in particular , the system has a trivial photonic topology when the inversion symmetry is the prevalent broken symmetry , whereas it has a nontrivial photonic topology for a dominant broken time - reversal symmetry , similar to the electronic case . to confirm these predictions , we numerically demonstrate the emergence of topologically protected unidirectional electromagnetic edge - states at the interface with a trivial photonic material .
