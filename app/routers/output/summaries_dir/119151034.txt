we consider an abstract quantum walk defined by a unitary evolution operator $ u$ , which acts on a hilbert space decomposed into a direct sum of hilbert spaces $ \{\mathcal{h}_v \}_{v \in v}$. we show that such $ u$ naturally defines a directed graph $ g_u$ and the probability of finding a quantum walker on $ g_u$. the asymptotic property of an abstract quantum walker is governed by the generator $ h$ of $ u$ such that $ u^n = e^{inh}$. we derive the generator of an evolution of the form $ u = s(2d_a^ * d_a -1)$ , a generalization of the szegedy evolution operator . here $ d_a$ is a boundary operator and $ s$ a shift operator .
