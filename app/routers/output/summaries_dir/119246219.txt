detecting nonclassical properties that do not allow classical interpretation of photoelectric counting events is one of the crucial themes in quantum optics . observation of individual nonclassical effects for a single - mode field , however , has been so far practically confined to sub - poissonian statistics and quadrature squeezing . we show that a photon - added classical ( coherent or thermal ) state exhibits generalized nonclassical features in all orders of creation and annihilation operators , thereby becoming a promising candidate for studying higher - order nonclassical effects . our analysis demonstrates robustness of these effects against nonideal experimental conditions .
