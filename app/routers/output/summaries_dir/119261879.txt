we present a multi - partite protocol in a counterfactual paradigm . in counterfactual quantum cryptography , secure information is transmitted between two spatially separated parties even when there is no physical travel of particles transferring the information between them . we propose here a tripartite counterfactual quantum protocol for the task of certificate authorization . here a trusted third party , alice , authenticates an entity bob ( e.g. , a bank ) that a client charlie wishes to securely transact with . the protocol is counterfactual with respect to either bob or charlie . we prove its security against a general incoherent attack , where eve attacks single particles .
