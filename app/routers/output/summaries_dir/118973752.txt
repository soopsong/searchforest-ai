we introduce and analyze a new type of decoding algorithm called general color clustering ( gcc ) , based on renormalization group methods , to be used in qudit color codes . the performance of this decoder is analyzed under code capacity depolarizing noise , and is used to obtain the first fault - tolerant threshold estimates for qudit 6 - 6 - 6 color codes . the proposed decoder is compared with similar decoding schemes for qudit surface codes as well as the current leading qubit decoders for both sets of codes . we find that , as with surface codes , clustering performs sub - optimally for qubit color codes , giving a threshold of $ 9.75\%$ compared to the $ 11.4\%$ obtained through surface projection decoding methods . however , the threshold rate increases by up to $ 75\%$ for large qudit dimensions , plateauing around $ 17.1\%$. all the analysis is performed using qtop , a new open - source software for simulating and visualizing topological quantum error correcting codes .
