a quantized form of surface plasmon polariton ( spp ) modes propagating on the metal thin film is provided , which is based on the green 's tensor method . since the media will be considered lossy and dispersive , the amplification and attenuation of the spp modes in various dielectric media , by applying different field frequencies , can be studied . we will also illustrate the difference between behavior of coherent and squeezed spp modes in the amplifying media .
