we propose an efficient protocol for measuring the concurrence of arbitrary two - photon pure entangled state with the help of the photonic faraday rotation . in the protocol , the concurrence of the photonic entangled state can be conversed into the total success probability for picking up the odd - parity photonic state . for completing the measurement task , we require some auxiliary three - level atoms , which are trapped in the low - quality cavities . our protocol can be well realized under current experimental conditions . moreover , under practical imperfect atom state detection and photonic faraday rotation conditions , our protocol can also work well . based on these features , our protocol may be useful in current quantum information processing .
