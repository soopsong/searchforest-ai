we study the effects of a power - law trapping potential on the scaling behaviour of the entanglement at the quantum critical point of one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice particle systems . we compute bipartite von neumann and renyi entropies in the presence of the trap , and analyze their scaling behaviour with increasing the trap size . as a theoretical laboratory , we consider the quantum xy chain in an external transverse field acting as a trap for the spinless fermions of its quadratic hamiltonian representation . we then investigate confined particle systems described by the 1d bose - hubbard model in the superfluid phase ( around the center of the trap ) . in both cases conformal field theory predicts logarithmically divergent bipartite entanglement entropies for the homogeneous systems without trap . the presence of the trapping potential breaks conformal invariance , affecting the critical behaviour of the homogeneous system . our results show that the bipartite entanglement entropies diverge logarithmically with increasing the trap size , and present notable scaling behaviours in the trap - size scaling limit .
