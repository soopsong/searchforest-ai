in a basic related - key attack against a block cipher , the adversary has access to encryptions under keys that differ from the target key by bit - flips . in this short note we show that for a quantum adversary such attacks are quite powerful : if the secret key is ( i ) uniquely determined by a small number of plaintext - ciphertext pairs , ( ii ) the block cipher can be evaluated efficiently , and ( iii ) a superposition of related keys can be queried , then the key can be extracted efficiently .
