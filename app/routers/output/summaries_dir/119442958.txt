the notion of typicality in statistical mechanics is essential to characterize a macroscopic system . an overwhelming majority of the pure state looks almost identical if we neglect macroscopic non - local correlations , suggesting that thermal equilibrium is the collection of the typical properties . quantum entanglement , which characterizes a non - local correlation , also has a typical behavior in equilibrium systems . however , it remains elusive whether there is a typical behavior of entanglement in dynamical non - equilibrium systems . to investigate the typicality , we consider a situation where a system in a pure state starts to share entanglement with its environment system due to the interaction between them . assuming the initial state is randomly chosen from an ensemble of pure states , a criteria for the typicality of the r\'enyi entropies is presented . in addition , it is analytically proven that the second r\'enyi entropy has a typical behavior in two cases . the first one is an energy dissipation process in a multiple - qubit system which is initially in a random pure state in an energy shell . since the typical behavior is qualitatively the same as the prediction of the page curve conjecture , it gives the first proof of the page curve conjecture in a dynamical process . in the second case , the typicality is proven for any dynamics described by a multiple - product of a single - qudit channel when the system is initially in a pure state randomly chosen from the whole hilbert space . this result shows that entanglement typicality is not a specific feature of energy dissipating processes .
