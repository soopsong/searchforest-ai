it is well known that the reduced state of a two - mode squeezed vacuum state is a thermal state --- i.e . a state whose photon - number statistics obey a geometric distribution . more exotic \emph{broadband } states can be realized as the reduced state of two spectrally - entangled beams generated using nonlinear optics . we show that these broadband"pseudothermal"states are tensor products of states in spectral schmidt modes , whose photon - number statistics obey a geometric distribution . we study the spectral and temporal coherence properties of these states and show that their spectral coherence can be tuned --- from perfect coherence to complete incoherence --- by adjusting the pump spectral width . in the limit of a cw pump , these states are tensor products of true thermal states , but with different temperatures at each frequency . this could be an interesting state of light for investigating the interplay between spectral , temporal , and photon - number coherences .
