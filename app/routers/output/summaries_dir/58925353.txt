we investigate the consequences of space - time being curved on space - based quantum communication protocols . we analyze tasks that require either the exchange of single photons in a certain entanglement distribution protocol or beams of light in a continuous - variable quantum key distribution scheme . we find that gravity affects the propagation of photons , therefore adding additional noise to the channel for the transmission of information . the effects could be measured with current technology .
