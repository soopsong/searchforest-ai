estimating the parameters that dictate the dynamics of a quantum system is an important task for quantum information processing and quantum metrology , as well as fundamental physics . in this paper we develop a method for parameter estimation for markovian open quantum systems using a temporal record of measurements on the system . the method is based on system realization theory and is a generalization of our previous work on identification of hamiltonian parameters [ phys . rev . lett . 113 , 080401 ( 2014 ) ] .
