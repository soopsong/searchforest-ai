the \emph{zero forcing number } , $ z(g)$ , of a graph $ g$ is the minimum cardinality of a set $ s$ of black vertices ( whereas vertices in $ v(g ) \setminus s$ are colored white ) such that $ v(g)$ is turned black after finitely many applications of"the color - change rule " : a white vertex is converted to a black vertex if it is the only white neighbor of a black vertex . zero forcing number was introduced and used to bound the minimum rank of graphs by the"aim minimum rank -- special graphs work group " . it 's known that $ z(g)\geq \delta(g)$ , where $ \delta(g)$ is the minimum degree of $ g$. we show that $ z(g)\leq n-3 $ if a connected graph $ g$ of order $ n$ has a connected complement graph $ \overline{g}$. further , we characterize a tree or a unicyclic graph $ g$ which satisfies either $ z(g)+z(\overline{g})=\delta(g)+\delta(\overline{g})$ or $ z(g)+z(\overline{g})=2(n-3)$.
