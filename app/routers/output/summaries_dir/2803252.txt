the tavis - cummings model for more than one qubit interacting with a common oscillator mode is extended beyond the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) . we explore the parameter regime in which the frequencies of the qubits are much smaller than the oscillator frequency and the coupling strength is allowed to be ultra - strong . the application of the adiabatic approximation , introduced by irish , et al . ( phys . rev . b \textbf{72 } , 195410 ( 2005 ) ) , for a single qubit system is extended to the multi - qubit case . for a two - qubit system , we identify three - state manifolds of close - lying dressed energy levels and obtain results for the dynamics of intra - manifold transitions that are incompatible with results from the familiar regime of the rwa . we exhibit features of two - qubit dynamics that are different from the single qubit case , including calculations of qubit - qubit entanglement . both number state and coherent state preparations are considered , and we derive analytical formulas that simplify the interpretation of numerical calculations . expressions for individual collapse and revival signals of both population and entanglement are derived .
