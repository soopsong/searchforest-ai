we describe and analyze leakage errors of singlet - triplet qubits . even though leakage errors are a natural problem for spin qubits encoded using quantum dot arrays , they have obtained little attention in previous studies . we describe the realization of leakage correction protocols that can be implemented together with the quantum error correction protocol of the surface code . furthermore we construct explicit leakage reduction units that need , in the ideal setup , as few as three manipulation steps . our study shows that leakage errors can be corrected without the need of measurements and at the cost of only a few additional ancilla qubits and gate operations compared to standard quantum error correction codes .
