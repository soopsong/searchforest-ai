optical communication channels are ultimately quantum - mechanical in nature , and we must therefore look beyond classical information theory to determine their communication capacity as well as to find efficient encoding and decoding schemes of the highest rates . thermal channels , which arise from linear coupling of the field to a thermal environment , are of particular practical relevance ; their classical capacity has been recently established , but their quantum capacity remains unknown . while the capacity sets the ultimate limit on reliable communication rates , it does not promise that such rates are achievable by practical means . here we construct efficiently encodable codes for thermal channels which achieve the classical capacity and the so - called gaussian coherent information for transmission of classical and quantum information , respectively . our codes are based on combining polar codes with a discretization of the channel input into a finite"constellation"of coherent states . encoding of classical information can be done using linear optics .
