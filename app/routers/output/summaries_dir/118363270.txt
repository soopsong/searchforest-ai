we present a direct relation , based upon a monogamic principle , between entanglement of formation ( eof ) and quantum discord ( qd ) , showing how they are distributed in an arbitrary tripartite pure system . by extending it to a paradigmatic situation of a bipartite system coupled to an environment , we demonstrate that the eof and the qd obey a conservation relation . by means of this relation we show that in the deterministic quantum computer with one pure qubit the protocol has the ability to rearrange the eof and the qd , which implies that quantum computation can be understood on a different basis as a coherent dynamics where quantum correlations are distributed between the qubits of the computer . furthermore , for a tripartite mixed state we show that the balance between distributed eof and qd results in a stronger version of the strong subadditivity of entropy .
