the lackadaisical quantum walk , which is a quantum walk with a weighted self - loop at each vertex , has been shown to speed up dispersion on the line and improve spatial search on the complete graph and periodic square lattice . in these investigations , each self - loop had the same weight , owing to each graph 's vertex - transitivity . in this paper , we propose lackadaisical quantum walks where the self - loops have different weights . we investigate spatial search on the complete bipartite graph , which can be irregular with $ n_1 $ and $ n_2 $ vertices in each partite set , and this naturally leads to self - loops in each partite set having different weights $ l_1 $ and $ l_2 $ , respectively . we analytically prove that for large $ n_1 $ and $ n_2 $ , if the $ k$ marked vertices are confined to , say , the first partite set , then with the typical initial uniform state over the vertices , the success probability is improved from its non - lackadaisical value when $ l_1 = kn_2/2n_1 $ and $ n_2>(3 - 2\sqrt{2 } ) n_1 $ , regardless of $ l_2$. when the initial state is stationary under the quantum walk , however , then the success probability is improved when $ l_1 = kn_2/2n_1 $ , now without a constraint on the ratio of $ n_1 $ and $ n_2 $ , and again independent of $ l_2$. next , when marked vertices lie in both partite sets , then for either initial state , there are many configurations for which the self - loops yield no improvement in quantum search , no matter what weights they take .
