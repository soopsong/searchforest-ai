we consider an asymmetric control of platoons of identical vehicles with nearest - neighbor interaction . recent results show that if the vehicle uses different asymmetries for position and velocity errors , the platoon has a short transient and low overshoots . in this paper we investigate the properties of vehicles with friction . to achieve consensus , an integral part is added to the controller , making the vehicle a third - order system . we show that the parameters can be chosen so that the platoon behaves as a wave equation with different wave velocities . simulations suggest that our system has a better performance than other nearest - neighbor scenarios . moreover , an optimization - based procedure is used to find the controller properties .
