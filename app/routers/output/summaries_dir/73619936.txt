using a circuit qed device , we present a theoretical study of real - time quantum state estimation via quantum bayesian approach . suitable conditions under which the bayesian approach can accurately update the density matrix of the qubit are analyzed . we also consider the correlation between some basic and physically meaningful parameters of the circuit qed and the performance of the bayesian approach . our results advance the understanding of quantum bayesian approach and pave the way to study quantum feedback control and adaptive control .
