amplified spontaneous emission is usually treated as an incoherent noise process . recent theoretical and experimental work using rephasing optical pulses has shown that rephased amplified spontaneous emission ( rase ) is a potential source of wide bandwidth time - delayed entanglement . due to poor echo efficiency the plain rase protocol does n't in theory achieve perfect entanglement . experiments done to date show a very small amount of entanglement at best . here we show that rephased amplified spontaneous emission can , in principle , produce perfect multimode time - delayed two mode squeezing when the active medium is placed inside a q - switched cavity .
