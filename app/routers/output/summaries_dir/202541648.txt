tunable open - access fabry - p\'erot microcavities enable the combination of cavity enhancement with high resolution imaging . to assess the limits of this technique originating from background variations , we perform high - finesse scanning cavity microscopy of pristine planar mirrors . we observe spatially localized features of strong cavity transmission reduction for certain cavity mode orders , and periodic background patterns with high spatial frequency . we show in detailed measurements that the localized structures originate from resonant transverse - mode coupling and arise from the topography of the planar mirror surface , in particular its local curvature and gradient . we further examine the background patterns and find that they derive from non - resonant mode coupling , and we attribute it to the micro roughness of the mirror . our measurements and analysis elucidate the impact of imperfect mirrors and reveal the influence of their microscopic topography . this is crucial for the interpretation of scanning cavity images , and could provide relevant insight for precision applications such as gravitational wave detectors , laser gyroscopes , and reference cavities .
