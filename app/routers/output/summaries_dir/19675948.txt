entanglement between two qubits ( two level atoms ) mediated by surface plasmons in three - dimensional plasmonic waveguides is studied using a quantum master equation formalism . two types of waveguides , a nanowire and a v - shaped channel cut in a flat metal plane , are considered . the green functions for the waveguides , which rigorously describes the dissipative qubit environment , are calculated numerically using a direct finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) solution of maxwell 's equations . finite - length effects are shown to play a crucial role in enhancing entanglement , and resonant - length plasmonic waveguides can provide higher entanglement between qubits than infinite - length waveguides . it is also shown that coupling slots can improve entanglement via stronger qubit - waveguide coupling , for both the infinite- and finite - waveguide cases .
