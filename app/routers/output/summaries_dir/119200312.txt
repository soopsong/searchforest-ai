the uhlmann - jozsa fidelity ( or , equivalently , the bures distance ) is a basic concept of quantum communication and quantum information , which however is very difficult to measure efficiently without recourse to quantum tomography . here we propose a direct experimental method to estimate the fidelity between two unknown two - qubit mixed states via the measurement of the upper and lower bounds of the fidelity , which are referred to as the superfidelity and subfidelity , respectively . our method enables a direct measurement of the first- and second - order overlaps between two arbitrary two - qubit states . in particular , the method can be applied to measure the purity ( or linear entropy ) of a single two - qubit mixed state in a direct experiment . we also propose and critically compare several experimental strategies for measuring the sub- and superfidelities of polarization states of photons in various linear - optical setups .
