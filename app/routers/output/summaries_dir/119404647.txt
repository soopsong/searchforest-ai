we introduce a framework for simulating quantum measurements based on classical processing of a set of accessible measurements . well - known concepts such as joint measurability and projective simulability naturally emerge as particular cases of our framework , but our study also leads to novel results and questions . first , a generalisation of joint measurability is derived , which yields a hierarchy for the incompatibility of sets of measurements . a similar hierarchy is defined based on the number of outcomes used to perform the simulation of a given measurement . this general approach also allows us to identify connections between different types of simulability and , in particular , we characterise the qubit measurements that are projective - simulable in terms of joint measurability . finally , we discuss how our framework can be interpreted in the context of resource theories .
