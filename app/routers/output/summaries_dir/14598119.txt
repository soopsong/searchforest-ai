we present a practical method for active phase control on a photonic chip that has immediate applications in quantum photonics . our approach uses strain - optic modification of the refractive index of individual waveguides , effected by a millimeter - scale mechanical actuator . the resulting phase change of propagating optical fields is rapid and polarization - dependent , enabling quantum applications that require active control and polarization encoding . we demonstrate strain - optic control of non - classical states of light in silica , showing the generation of 2-photon polarisation n00n states by manipulating hong - ou - mandel interference . we also demonstrate switching times of a few microseconds , which are sufficient for silica - based feed - forward control of photonic quantum states .
