scalable photonic quantum technologies are based on multiple nested interferometers . to realize this architecture , integrated optical structures are needed to ensure stable , controllable , and repeatable operation . here we show a key proof - of - principle demonstration of an externally - controlled photonic quantum circuit based upon uv - written waveguide technology . in particular , we present non - classical interference of photon pairs in a mach - zehnder interferometer constructed with x couplers in an integrated optical circuit with a thermo - optic phase shifter in one of the interferometer arms .
