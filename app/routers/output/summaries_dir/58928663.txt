entanglement is an important evidence that a quantum device can potentially solve problems intractable for classical computers . in this paper , we prepare connected graph states involving 8 to 16 qubits on ibmqx5 , a 16-qubit superconducting quantum processor accessible via ibm cloud , using low - depth circuits . we demonstrate that the prepared state is fully entangled , i.e. the state is inseparable with respect to any fixed partition .
