to store and retrieve signals at the single photon level , various photon echo schemes have resorted to complex preparation steps involving ancillary shelving states in multi - level atoms . for the first time , we experimentally demonstrate photon echo operation at such a low signal intensity without any preparation step , which allows us to work with mere two - level atoms . this simplified approach relies on the so - coined"revival of silenced echo"(rose ) scheme . low noise conditions are obtained by returning the atoms to the ground state before the echo emission . in the present paper we manage rose in photon counting conditions , showing that very strong control fields can be compatible with extremely weak signals , making rose consistent with quantum memory requirements .
