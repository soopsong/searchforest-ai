four questions are discussed which may be addressed to any proposal of a quantum - classical hybrid theory which concerns the direct coupling of classical and quantum mechanical degrees of freedom . in particular , we consider the formulation of hybrid dynamics presented recently in ref.[1 ] . this linear theory differs from the nonlinear ensemble theory of hall and reginatto , but shares with it to fulfil all consistency requirements discussed in the literature , while earlier attempts failed . - here , we additionally ask : does the theory allow for superposition , separable , and entangled states originating in the quantum mechanical sector ? does it allow for"free will " , as introduced , in this context , by diosi [ 2 ] . is it local ? does it provide hints for the emergence of quantum mechanics from dynamics beneath ?
