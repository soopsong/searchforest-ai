quantum optics in combination with integrated optical devices shows great promise for efficient manipulation of single photons . new physical concepts , however , can only be found when these fields truly merge and reciprocally enhance each other . here we work at the merging point and investigate the physical concept behind a two - coupled - waveguide system with an integrated parametric down - conversion process . we use the eigenmode description of the linear system and the resulting modification in momentum conservation to derive the state generation protocol for this type of device . with this new concept of state engineering , we are able to effectively implement a two - in - one waveguide source that produces the useful two - photon noon state without extra overhead such as phase stabilization or narrow - band filtering . experimentally , we benchmark our device by measuring a two - photon noon state fidelity of $ \mathcal{f } = ( 84.2 \pm 2.6 ) \%$ and observe the characteristic interferometric pattern directly given by the doubled phase dependence with a visibility of $ v_{\mathrm{noon } } = ( 93.3 \pm 3.7 ) \%$.
