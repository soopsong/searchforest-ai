we study a coherent superposition of field annihilation and creation operator acting on continuous variable systems and propose its application for quantum state engineering . specifically , it is investigated how the superposed operation transforms a classical state to a nonclassical one , together with emerging nonclassical effects . we also propose an experimental scheme to implement this elementary coherent operation and discuss its usefulness to produce an arbitrary superposition of number states involving up to two photons .
