we study the relationship between the collective phenomena of super and subradiance and spontaneous synchronization of quantum systems . to this aim we revisit the case of two detuned qubits interacting through a pure dissipative bosonic environment , which contains the minimal ingredients for our analysis . by using the liouville formalism , we are able to find analytically the ultimate connection between these phenomena . we find that dynamical synchronization is due to the presence of long standing coherence between the ground state of the system and the subradiant state . we finally show that , under pure dissipation , the emergence of spontaneous synchronization and of subradiant emission occur on the same time scale . this reciprocity is broken in the presence of dephasing noise .
