we study kerr nonlinear resonators ( knr ) driven by a continuous wave field in quantum regimes where strong kerr interactions give rise to selective resonant excitations of oscillatory modes . we use an exact quantum theory of knr in the framework of the fokker - planck equation without any quantum state truncation or perturbation procedure . this approach allows non - perturbative consideration of knr for various quantum operational regimes including cascaded processes between oscillatory states . we focus on understanding of multi - photon non - resonant and selective resonant excitations of introcavity mode depending on the detuning , the amplitude of the driving field and the strength of nonlinearity . the analysis is provided on the base of photon number distributions , the photon - number correlation function and the wigner function .
