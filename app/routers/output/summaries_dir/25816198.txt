in the study of small and large networks it is customary to perform a simple random walk , where the random walker jumps from one node to one of its neighbours with uniform probability . the properties of this random walk are intimately related to the combinatorial properties of the network . in this paper we propose to use the ruelle - bowens random walk instead , whose probability transitions are chosen in order to maximise the entropy rate of the walk on an unweighted graph . if the graph is weighted , then a free energy is optimised instead of entropy rate . specifically , we introduce a centrality measure for large networks , which is the stationary distribution attained by the the ruelle - bowens random walk ; we name it entropy rank . we introduce a more general version , able to deal with disconnected networks , under the name of free energy rank . we compare the properties of those centrality measures with the classic pagerank and hits on both toy and real - life examples , in particular their robustness to small modifications of the network . it is observed that our centrality measures have a better discriminating power than pagerank , being able to distinguish clearly pages that pagerank holds for almost equally interesting , and is more sensitive to the medium - scale details of the graph .
