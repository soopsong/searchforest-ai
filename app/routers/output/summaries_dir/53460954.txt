in the context of bipartite bosonic systems , two notions of classicality of correlations can be defined : p - classicality , based on the properties of the glauber - sudarshan p - function ; and c - classicality , based on the entropic quantum discord . it has been shown that these two notions are maximally inequivalent in a static ( metric ) sense -- as they coincide only on a set of states of zero measure . we extend and reinforce quantitatively this inequivalence by addressing the dynamical relation between these types of non - classicality in a paradigmatic quantum - optical setting : the linear mixing at a beam splitter of a single - mode gaussian state with a thermal reference state . specifically , we show that almost all p - classical input states generate outputs that are not c - classical . indeed , for the case of zero thermal reference photons , the more p - classical resources at the input the less c - classicality at the output . in addition , we show that the p - classicality at the input -- as quantified by the non - classical depth -- does instead determine quantitatively the potential of generating output entanglement . this endows the non - classical depth with a new operational interpretation : it gives the maximum number of thermal reference photons that can be mixed at a beam splitter without destroying the output entanglement .
