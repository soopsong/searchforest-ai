integrated optics allow the generation and control of increasingly complex photonic states on chip based architectures . here , we implement two entangled qutrits - a 9-dimensional quantum system - and demonstrate an exceptionally high degree of experimental control . the approach which is conceptually different to common bulk optical implementations is heavily based on methods of integrated in - fiber and on - chip technologies and further motivated by methods commonly used in today 's telecommunication industry . the system is composed of an in - fiber source creating entangled qutrit states of any amplitude and phase and an on - chip integrated general multiport enabling the realization of any desired local unitary transformation within the two qutrit 9-dimensional hilbert space . the complete design is readily extendible towards higher - dimensions with moderate increase in complexity . ultimately , our scheme allows for complete on - chip integration . we demonstrate the flexibility and generality of our system by realizing a complete characterization of the two qutrit space of higher - order einstein - podolsky - rosen correlations .
