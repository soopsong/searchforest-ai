we investigate superradiant cascade emissions from an atomic ensemble driven by two - color classical fields . the correlated pair of photons ( signal and idler ) is generated by adiabatically driving the system with large - detuned light fields via four - wave mixing . the signal photon from the upper transition of the diamond - type atomic levels is followed by the idler one which can be superradiant due to light - induced dipole - dipole interactions . we then calculate the cooperative lamb shift ( cls ) of the idler photon , which is a cumulative effect of interaction energy.we study its dependence on a cylindrical geometry , a conventional setup in cold atom experiments , and estimate the maximum cls which can be significant and observable . manipulating the cls of cascade emissions enables frequency qubits that provide alternative robust elements in quantum network .
