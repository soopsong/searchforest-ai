we study the decoherence and the relaxation dynamics of topological states in an extended class of quantum ising chains which can present a manyfold ground state subspace . the leading interaction of the spins with the environment is assumed to be the local fluctuations of the transverse magnetic field . by deriving the lindblad equation using the many - body states , we investigate the relation between decoherence , energy relaxation and topology . in particular , in the topological phase and at low temperature , we analyze the dephasing rates between the different degenerate ground states .
