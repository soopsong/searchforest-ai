strong coupling between a two - level system ( tls ) and bosonic modes produces dramatic quantum optics effects . we consider a one - dimensional continuum of bosons coupled to a single localized tls , a system which may be realized in a variety of plasmonic , photonic , or electronic contexts . we present the exact many - body scattering eigenstate obtained by imposing open boundary conditions . multi - photon bound states appear in the scattering of two or more photons due to the coupling between the photons and the tls . such bound states are shown to have a large effect on scattering of both fock and coherent state wavepackets , especially in the intermediate coupling strength regime . we compare the statistics of the transmitted light with a coherent state having the same mean photon number : as the interaction strength increases , the one - photon probability is suppressed rapidly , and the two- and three - photon probabilities are greatly enhanced due to the many - body bound states . this results in non - poissonian light .
