image classification is an important task in the field of machine learning and image processing . however , the usually used classification method --- the k nearest - neighbor algorithm has high complexity , because its two main processes : similarity computing and searching are time - consuming . especially in the era of big data , the problem is prominent when the amount of images to be classified is large . in this paper , we try to use the powerful parallel computing ability of quantum computers to optimize the efficiency of image classification . the scheme is based on quantum k nearest - neighbor algorithm . firstly , the feature vectors of images are extracted on classical computers . then the feature vectors are inputted into a quantum superposition state , which is used to achieve parallel computing of similarity . next , the quantum minimum search algorithm is used to speed up searching process for similarity . finally , the image is classified by quantum measurement . the complexity of the quantum algorithm is only o((km)^(1/2 ) ) , which is superior to the classical algorithms . moreover , the measurement step is executed only once to ensure the validity of the scheme . the experimental results show that , the classification accuracy is 83.1 % on graz-01 dataset and 78 % on caltech-101 dataset , which is close to existing classical algorithms . hence , our quantum scheme has a good classification performance while greatly improving the efficiency .
