ultracold atomic systems offer a unique tool for understanding behavior of matter in the quantum degenerate regime , promising studies of a vast range of phenomena covering many disciplines from condensed matter to quantum information and particle physics . coupling these systems to quantized light fields opens further possibilities of observing delicate effects typical of quantum optics in the context of strongly correlated systems . measurement backaction is one of the most fundamental manifestations of quantum mechanics and it is at the core of many famous quantum optics experiments . here we show that quantum backaction of weak measurement can be used for tailoring long - range correlations of ultracold fermions , realizing quantum states with spatial modulations of the density and magnetization , thus overcoming usual requirement for a strong interatomic interactions . we propose detection schemes for implementing antiferromagnetic states and density waves . we demonstrate that such long - range correlations can not be realized with local addressing , and they are a consequence of the competition between global but spatially structured backaction of weak quantum measurement and unitary dynamics of fermions .
