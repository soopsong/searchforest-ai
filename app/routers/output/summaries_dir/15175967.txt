carnot established in 1824 that the efficiency of cyclic engines operating between a hot bath at absolute temperature $ t_{hot}$ and a bath at a lower temperature $ t_{cold}$ can not exceed $ 1-t_{cold}/t_{hot}$. we show that linear oscillators alternately in contact with hot and cold baths obey this principle in the quantum as well as in the classical regime . the expression of the work performed is derived from a simple prescription . reversible and non - reversible cycles are illustrated . the paper begins with historical considerations and is essentially self - contained .
