in this paper , we systematically study the spontaneous decay phenomenon of a two - level system under the influences of both its environment and continuous measurements . in order to clarify some well - established conclusions about the quantum zeno effect ( qze ) and the quantum anti - zeno effect ( qaze ) , we do not use the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) in obtaining an effective hamiltonian . we examine various spectral distributions by making use of our present approach in comparison with other approaches . it is found that with respect to a bare excited state even without the rwa , the qaze can still happen for some cases , e.g. , the interacting spectra of hydrogen . but for a physical excited state , which is a renormalized dressed state of the atomic state , the qaze disappears and only the qze remains . these discoveries inevitably show a transition from the qze to the qaze as the measurement interval changes .
