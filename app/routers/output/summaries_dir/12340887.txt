we propose a method to improve the performance of two entanglement - based continuous - variable quantum key distribution protocols using noiseless linear amplifiers . the two entanglement - based schemes consist of an entanglement distribution protocol with an untrusted source and an entanglement swapping protocol with an untrusted relay . simulation results show that the noiseless linear amplifiers can improve the performance of these two protocols , in terms of maximal transmission distances , when we consider small amounts of entanglement , as typical in realistic setups .
