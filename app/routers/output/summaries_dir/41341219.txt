in view of real world applications of quantum information technologies , the combination of miniature quantum resources with existing fibre networks is a crucial issue . among such resources , on - chip entangled photon sources play a central role for applications spanning quantum communications , computing and metrology . here , we use a semiconductor source of entangled photons operating at room temperature in conjunction with standard telecom components to demonstrate multi - user quantum key distribution , a core protocol for securing communications in quantum networks . the source consists of an algaas chip emitting polarization entangled photon pairs over a large bandwidth in the main telecom band around 1550 nm without the use of any off - chip compensation or interferometric scheme ; the photon pairs are directly launched into a dense wavelength division multiplexer ( dwdm ) and secret keys are distributed between several pairs of users communicating through different channels . we achieve a visibility measured after the dwdm of 87 % and show long - distance key distribution using a 50-km standard telecom fibre link between two network users . these results illustrate a promising route to practical , resource - efficient implementations adapted to quantum network infrastructures .
