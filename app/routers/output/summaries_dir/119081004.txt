parametrically modulated optomechanical systems have been recently proposed as a simple and efficient setting for the quantum control of a micromechanical oscillator : relevant possibilities include the generation of squeezing in the oscillator position ( or momentum ) and the enhancement of entanglement between mechanical and radiation modes . in this paper we further investigate this new modulation regime , considering an optomechanical system with one or more parameters being modulated over time . we first apply a sinusoidal modulation of the mechanical frequency and characterize the optimal regime in which the visibility of purely quantum effects is maximal . we then introduce a second modulation on the input laser intensity and analyze the interplay between the two . we find that an interference pattern shows up , so that different choices of the relative phase between the two modulations can either enhance or cancel the desired quantum effects .
