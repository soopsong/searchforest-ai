we present an input / output analysis of photon - correlation experiments whereby a quantum mechanically entangled bi - photon state interacts with a material sample placed in one arm of a hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) apparatus . we show that the output signal contains detailed information about subsequent entanglement with the microscopic quantum states in the sample . in particular , we apply the method to an ensemble of emitters interacting with a common photon mode within the open - system dicke model . our results indicate considerable dynamical information concerning spontaneous symmetry breaking can be revealed with such an experimental system .
