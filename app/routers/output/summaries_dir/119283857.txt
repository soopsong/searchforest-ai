we present a quantum field theoretical approach based on the lehmann - symanzik - zimmermann reduction for the multi - photon scattering process in a nano - architecture consisting of the coupled resonator arrays ( cra ) , which are also coupled to some artificial atoms as the controlling quantum node . by making use of this approach , we find the bound states of single photon for an elementary unit , the t - type cra , and explicitly obtain its multi - photon scattering s - matrix in various situations . we also use this method to calculate the multi - photon s - matrices for the more complex quantum network constructed with main t - type cra 's , such as a h - type cra waveguide .
