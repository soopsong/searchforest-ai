physically motivated classical heuristic optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing ( sa ) treat the objective function as an energy landscape , and allow walkers to escape local minima . it has been argued that quantum properties such as tunneling may give quantum algorithms advantage in finding ground states of vast , rugged cost landscapes . indeed , the quantum adiabatic algorithm ( qao ) and the recent quantum approximate optimization algorithm ( qaoa ) have shown promising results on various problem instances that are considered classically hard . here , we argue that the type of control strategy used by the optimization algorithm may be crucial to its success . along with sa , qao and qaoa , we define a new , bang - bang version of simulated annealing , bbsa , and study the performance of these algorithms on two well - studied problem instances from the literature . both classically and quantumly , the successful control strategy is found to be bang - bang , exponentially outperforming the quasistatic analogues on the same instances . lastly , we construct o(1)-depth qaoa protocols for a class of symmetric cost functions , and provide an accompanying physical picture .
