recently the power of positive partial transpose preserving ( pptp ) and no - signalling ( ns ) codes in quantum communication has been studied . we continue with this line of research and show that the ns / pptp / ns$\cap$pptp codes assisted zero - error quantum capacity depends only on the non - commutative bipartite graph of the channel and the one - shot case can be computed efficiently by semidefinite programming ( sdp ) . as an example , the activated pptp codes assisted zero - error quantum capacity is carefully studied . we then present a general sdp upper bound $ q_\gamma$ of quantum capacity and show it is always smaller than or equal to the"partial transposition bound"introduced by holevo and werner , and the inequality could be strict . this upper bound is found to be additive , and thus is an upper bound of the potential pptp assisted quantum capacity as well . we further demonstrate that $ q_\gamma$ is strictly better than several previously known upper bounds for an explicit class of quantum channels . finally , we show that $ q_\gamma$ can be used to bound the super - activation of quantum capacity .
