we investigate energy transport in several two - level atom or spin-1/2 models by a direct coupling to heat baths of different temperatures . the analysis is carried out on the basis of a recently derived quantum master equation which describes the nonequilibrium properties of internally weakly coupled systems appropriately . for the computation of the stationary state of the dynamical equations , we employ a monte carlo wave - function approach . the analysis directly indicates normal diffusive or ballistic transport in finite models and hints toward an extrapolation of the transport behavior of infinite models .
