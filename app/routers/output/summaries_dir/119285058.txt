measuring an entangled state of two particles is crucial to many quantum communication protocols . yet bell state distinguishability using a finite apparatus obeying linear evolution and local measurement is theoretically limited . we extend known bounds for bell - state distinguishability in one and two variables to the general case of entanglement in $ n$ two - state variables . we show that at most $ 2^{n+1}-1 $ classes out of $ 4^n$ hyper - bell states can be distinguished with one copy of the input state . with two copies , complete distinguishability is possible . we present optimal schemes in each case .
