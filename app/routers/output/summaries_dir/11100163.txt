we apply classical algorithms for approximately solving constraint satisfaction problems to find bounds on extremal eigenvalues of local hamiltonians . we consider spin hamiltonians for which we have an upper bound on the number of terms in which each spin participates , and find extensive bounds for the operator norm and ground - state energy of such hamiltonians under this constraint . in each case the bound is achieved by a product state which can be found efficiently using a classical algorithm .
