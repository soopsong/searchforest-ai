we report on the anomalous behavior of control pulses for spins under spin - spin relaxation and subject to classical noise with a singular autocorrelation function . this behavior is not detected for noise with analytic autocorrelation functions . the effect is manifest in the different scaling behavior of the deviation of a real pulse to the ideal , instantaneous one . while a standard pulse displays scaling $ \propto \tau_\mathrm{p}^1 $ , a first - order refocusing pulse normally shows scaling $ \propto \tau_\mathrm{p}^2$. but in presence of cusps in the noise autocorrelation the scaling $ \propto \tau_\mathrm{p}^{3/2}$ occurs . cusps in the autocorrelation are characteristic for fast fluctuations in the noise with a spectral density of lorentzian shape . we prove that the anomalous exponent can not be avoided ; it represents a fundamental limit . on the one hand , this redefines the strategies one has to adopt to design refocusing pulses . on the other hand , the anomalous exponent , if found in experiment , provides important information on the noise properties .
