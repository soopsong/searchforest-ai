the transition probability in first - order perturbation theory for an unruh - dewitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field in minkowski space is calculated . it has been shown recently that the conventional $ i\epsilon$ regularisation prescription for the correlation function leads to non - lorentz invariant results for the transition rate , and a different regularisation , involving spatial smearing of the field , has been advocated to replace it . we show that the non - lorentz invariance arises solely from the assumption of sudden switch - on and switch - off of the detector , and that when the model includes a smooth switching function the results from the conventional regularisation are both finite and lorentz invariant . the sharp switching limit of the model is also discussed , as well as the falloff properties of the spectrum for large frequencies .
