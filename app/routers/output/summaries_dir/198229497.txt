we report on the fabrication and characterization of 50 ohms , flux - tunable , low - loss , squid - based transmission lines . the fabrication process relies on the deposition of a thin dielectric layer ( few tens of nanometers ) via atomic layer deposition ( ald ) on top of a squid array , the whole structure is then covered by a non - superconducting metallic top ground plane . we present experimental results from five different samples . we systematically characterize their microscopic parameters by measuring the propagating phase in these structures . we also investigate losses and discriminate conductor from dielectric losses . this fabrication method offers several advantages . first , the squid array fabrication does not rely on a niobium tri - layer process but on a simpler double angle evaporation technique . second , ald provides high quality dielectric leading to low - loss devices . further , the squid array fabrication is based on a standard , all - aluminum process , allowing direct integration with superconducting qubits . moreover , our devices are in - situ flux tunable , allowing mitigation of incertitude inherent to any fabrication process . finally , the unit cell being a single squid ( no extra ground capacitance is needed ) , it is straightforward to modulate the size of the unit cell periodically , allowing band - engineering . this fabrication process can be directly applied to traveling wave parametric amplifiers .
