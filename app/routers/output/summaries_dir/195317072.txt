no experiment to date provided evidence for quantum features of the gravitational interaction . recently proposed tests suggest looking for the generation of quantum entanglement between massive objects as a possible route towards the observation of such features . motivated by advances in optical cooling of mirrors , here we provide systematic study of entanglement between two masses that are coupled gravitationally . we first consider the masses trapped at all times in harmonic potentials ( optomechanics ) and then masses released from the traps . this leads to the estimate of the experimental parameters required for the observation of gravitationally - induced entanglement . the optomechanical setup demands ligo - like mirrors and squeezing or long coherence times , but the released masses can be light and accumulate detectable entanglement in a timescale shorter than their decoherence times . no macroscopic quantum superposition develops during the evolution . we discuss the implications from such thought experiments regarding the nature of the gravitational coupling .
