experimental realization of various quantum states of interest has become possible in the recent past due to the rapid developments in the field of quantum state engineering . nonclassical properties of such states have led to various exciting applications , specifically in the area of quantum information processing . the present article aims to study lower- and higher - order nonclassical features of such an engineered quantum state ( a generalized binomial state based on abel 's formula ) . present study has revealed that the state studied here is highly nonclassical . specifically , higher - order nonclassical properties of this state are reported using a set of witnesses , like higher - order antibunching , higher - order sub - poissonian photon statistics , higher - order squeezing ( both hong mandel type and hillery type ) . a set of other witnesses for lower- and higher - order nonclassicality ( e.g. , vogel 's criterion and agarwal 's a parameter ) have also been explored . further , an analytic expression for the wigner function of the generalized binomial state is reported and the same is used to witness nonclassicality and to quantify the amount of nonclassicality present in the system by computing the nonclassical volume ( volume of the negative part of the wigner function ) . optical tomogram of the generalized binomial state is also computed for various conditions as wigner function can not be measured directly in an experiment in general , but the same can be obtained from the optical tomogram with the help of radon transform .
