we study the efficiency of algorithms simulating a system evolving with hamiltonian $ h=\sum_{j=1}^m h_j$. we consider high order splitting methods that play a key role in quantum hamiltonian simulation . we obtain upper bounds on the number of exponentials required to approximate $ e^{-iht}$ with error $ \e$. moreover , we derive the order of the splitting method that optimizes the cost of the resulting algorithm . we show significant speedups relative to previously known results .
