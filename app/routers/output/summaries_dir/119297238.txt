we realize mirror templates on the tips of optical fibers using a single - shot co$_2 $ laser ablation procedure . we perform a systematic study of the influence of the pulse power , pulse duration , and laser spot size on the radius of curvature , depth , and diameter of the mirror templates . we find that these geometrical characteristics can be tuned to a larger extent than has been previously reported , and notably observe that compound convex - concave shapes can be obtained . this detailed investigation should help further the understanding of the physics of co$_2 $ laser ablation processes and help improve current models . we additionally identify regimes of ablation parameters that lead to mirror templates with favorable geometries for use in cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics .
