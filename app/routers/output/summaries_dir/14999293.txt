in this paper we explore how recent technologies can improve the security of optical networks . in particular , we study how to use quantum key distribution ( qkd ) in common optical network infrastructures and propose a method to overcome its distance limitations . qkd is the first technology offering information theoretic secret - key distribution that relies only on the fundamental principles of quantum physics . point - to - point qkd devices have reached a mature industrial state ; however , these devices are severely limited in distance , since signals at the quantum level ( e.g. single photons ) are highly affected by the losses in the communication channel and intermediate devices . to overcome this limitation , intermediate nodes ( i.e. repeaters ) are used . both , quantum - regime and trusted , classical , repeaters have been proposed in the qkd literature , but only the latter can be implemented in practice . as a novelty , we propose here a new qkd network model based on the use of not fully trusted intermediate nodes , referred as weakly trusted repeaters . this approach forces the attacker to simultaneously break several paths to get access to the exchanged key , thus improving significantly the security of the network . we formalize the model using network codes and provide real scenarios that allow users to exchange secure keys over metropolitan optical networks using only passive components . moreover , the theoretical framework allows to extend these scenarios not only to accommodate more complex trust constraints , but also to consider robustness and resiliency constraints on the network .
