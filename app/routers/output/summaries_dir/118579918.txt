inelastic scattering processes such as brillouin scattering can often function in cascaded regimes and this is likely to occur in certain integrated opto - acoustic devices . we develop a hamiltonian formalism for cascaded brillouin scattering valid for both quantum and classical regimes . by regarding brillouin scattering as the interaction of a single acoustic envelope and a single optical envelope that covers all stokes and anti - stokes orders , we obtain a compact model that is well suited for numerical implementation , extension to include other optical nonlinearities or short pulses , and application in the quantum - optics domain . we then theoretically analyze intra - mode forward brillouin scattering ( fbs ) for arbitrary waveguides with and without optical dispersion . in the absence of optical dispersion , we find an exact analytical solution . with a perturbative approach , we furthermore solve the case of weak optical dispersion . our work leads to several key results on intra - mode fbs . for negligible dispersion , we show that cascaded intra - mode fbs results in a pure phase modulation and discuss how this necessitates specific experimental methods for the observation of fibre - based and integrated fbs . further , we discuss how the descriptions that have been established in these two classes of waveguides connect to each other and to the broader context of cavity opto - mechanics and raman scattering . finally , we draw an unexpected striking similarity between fbs and discrete diffraction phenomena in waveguide arrays , which makes fbs an interesting candidate for future research in quantum - optics .
