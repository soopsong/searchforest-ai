cloning of statistics of general quantum measurement is discussed . the presented approach is connected with the known concept of observable cloning , but differs in some essential respects . the reasons are illustrated within some variety of b92 protocol . as it is shown , there exist pairs of states such that the perfect cloning of given povm is not possible . we discuss some properties of these intolerant sets . an example allowing the perfect cloning is presented as well .
