quantum mechanics , one of the most successful theories in the history of science , was created to account for physical systems not describable by classical physics . though it is consistent with all experiments conducted thus far , many of its core concepts ( amplitudes , global phases , etc . ) can not be directly accessed and its interpretation is still the subject of intense debate , more than 100 years since it was introduced . so , a fundamental question is why this particular mathematical model is the one that nature chooses , if indeed it is the correct model . in the past two decades there has been a renewed effort to determine what physical or informational principles define quantum mechanics . in this paper , recent attempts at establishing reasonable physical principles are reviewed and their degree of success is tabulated . an alternative approach using joint quasi - probability distributions is shown to provide a common basis of representing most of the proposed principles . it is argued that having a common representation of the principles can provide intuition and guidance to relate current principles or advance new principles . the current state of affairs , along with some alternative views are discussed .
