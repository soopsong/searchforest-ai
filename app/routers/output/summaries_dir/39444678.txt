the realization of cross - kerr nonlinearity is an important task for many applications in quantum information processing . in this work , we propose a method for realizing cross - kerr nonlinearity interaction between two superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators coupled by a three - level superconducting flux qutrit ( coupler ) . by employing the qutrit - resonator dispersive interaction , we derive an effective hamiltonian involving two - photon number operators and a coupler operator . this hamiltonian can be used to describe a cross - kerr nonlinearity interaction between two resonators when the coupler is in the ground state . because the coupler is unexcited during the entire process , the effect of coupler decoherence can be greatly minimized . more importantly , compared with the previous proposals , our proposal does not require classical pulses . furthermore , due to use of only a three - level qutrit , the experimental setup is much simplified when compared with previous proposals requiring a four - level artificial atomic systems . based on our hamiltonian , we implement a two - resonator qubits controlled - phase gate and generate a two - resonator entangled coherent state . numerical simulation shows that the high - fidelity implementation of the phase gate and creation of the entangled coherent state are feasible with current circuit qed technology .
