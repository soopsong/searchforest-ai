group theory ( gt ) provides a rigorous framework for studying symmetries in various disciplines in physics ranging from quantum field theories and the standard model to fluid mechanics and chaos theory . to date , the application of such a powerful tool in optical physics remains limited . over the past few years however , several quantum - inspired symmetry principles ( such as parity - time invariance and supersymmetry ) have been introduced in optics and photonics for the first time . despite the intense activities in these new research directions , only few works utilized the power of group theory . motivated by this status quo , here we present a brief overview of the application of gt in optics , deliberately choosing examples that illustrate the power of this tool in both continuous and discrete setups . we hope that this review will stimulate further research that exploits the full potential of gt for investigating various symmetry paradigms in optics , eventually leading to new photonic devices .
