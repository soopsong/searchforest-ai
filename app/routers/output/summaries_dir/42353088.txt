the black hole information paradox arises from an apparent conflict between the hawking black hole radiation and the fact that time evolution in quantum mechanics is unitary . the trouble is that while the former suggests that information of a system falling into a black hole disappears , the latter implies that information must be conserved . in this work we discuss the current divergence in views regarding the paradox , we evaluate the role that objective collapse theories could play in its resolution and we propose a link between spontaneous collapse events and microscopic virtual black holes .
