recently , several hybrid approaches to quantum information emerged which utilize both continuous- and discrete - variable methods and resources at the same time . in this work , we investigate the bipartite hybrid entanglement between a finite - dimensional , discrete - variable quantum system and an infinite - dimensional , continuous - variable quantum system . a classification scheme is presented leading to a distinction between pure hybrid entangled states , mixed hybrid entangled states ( those effectively supported by an overall finite - dimensional hilbert space ) , and so - called truly hybrid entangled states ( those which can not be described in an overall finite - dimensional hilbert space ) . examples for states of each regime are given and entanglement witnessing as well as quantification are discussed . in particular , using the channel map of a thermal photon noise channel , we find that true hybrid entanglement naturally occurs in physically important settings . finally , extensions from bipartite to multipartite hybrid entanglement are considered .
