here we report of a design and the performance of an optimized micro - fabricated conveyor belt for precise and adiabatic transportation of cold atoms . a theoretical model is presented to determine optimal currents in conductors used for the transportation . we experimentally demonstrate a fast adiabatic transportation of rubidium ( $ ^{87}$rb ) cold atoms with minimal loss and heating with as few as three conveyor belt conductors . this novel design of a multilayered conveyor belt structure is fabricated in aluminium nitride ( $ aln$ ) because of its outstanding thermal and electrical properties . this demonstration would pave a way for a compact and portable quantum device required for quantum information processing and sensors , where precise positioning of cold atoms is desirable .
