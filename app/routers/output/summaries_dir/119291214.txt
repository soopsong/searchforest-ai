recently , a new model of quantum walk , utilizing recycled coins , was introduced ; however little is yet known about its properties . in this paper , we study its behavior on the cycle graph . in particular , we will consider its time averaged distribution and how it is affected by the walk's"memory parameter"- a real parameter , between zero and eight , which affects the walk 's coin flip operator . despite an infinite number of different parameters , our analysis provides evidence that only a few produce non - uniform behavior . our analysis also shows that the initial state , and cycle size modulo four all affect the behavior of this walk . we also prove an interesting relationship between the recycled coin model and a different memory - based quantum walk recently proposed .
