i propose classical and quantum limits to the statistical resolution of two incoherent optical point sources from the perspective of minimax parameter estimation . unlike earlier results based on the cram\'er - rao bound , the limits proposed here , based on the worst - case error criterion and a bayesian version of the cram\'er - rao bound , are valid for any biased or unbiased estimator and obey photon - number scalings that are consistent with the behaviors of actual estimators . these results prove that , from the minimax perspective , the spatial - mode demultiplexing ( spade ) measurement scheme recently proposed by tsang , nair , and lu [ phys . rev . x 6 , 031033 ( 2016 ) ] remains superior to direct imaging for sufficiently high photon numbers .
