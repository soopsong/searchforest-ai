in this paper , we study quantum algorithms of matrix multiplication from the viewpoint of inputting quantum / classical data to outputting quantum / classical data . the main target is trying to overcome the input and output problem , which are not easy to solve and many quantum algorithms will encounter , to study matrix operations in quantum computer with high efficiency . and solving matrix multiplication will be the first step . we propose three quantum algorithms to matrix multiplication based on swap test , sve and hhl . from the point of making fewer assumptions , swap test method works the best than the other two . we also show that the quantum algorithm of matrix multiplication with classical input and output data by swap test achieves the best complexity $ \widetilde{o}(n^2/\epsilon)$ with no assumptions . this is proved by giving an efficient quantum algorithm in polynomial time to solve the input problem , that is to prepare the quantum states of the classical data efficiently . other contributions of this paper include : ( 1 ) . extending swap test to a more general form that is suitable to deal with quantum data in parallel , which will have further applications in other matrix operations . ( 2 ) . generalizing sve technique such that it applies to any matrix ( not just hermitian ) directly only with quantum data . ( 3 ) . proposing two new efficient quantum algorithms to prepare quantum states of classical data , which solves the input problem efficiently than other quantum algorithms .
