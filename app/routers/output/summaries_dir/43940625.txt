we construct an optimal set of single - particle states for few - electron quantum dots ( qds ) using the method of natural orbitals ( nos ) . the nos include also the effects of the coulomb repulsion between electrons . we find that they agree well with the noniteracting orbitals for gaas qds of realistic parameters , while the coulomb interactions only rescale the radius of the nos compared to the noninteracting case . we use nos to show that four - electron qds are less susceptible to charge noise than their two - electron counterparts .
