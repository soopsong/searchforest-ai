we study the classical complexity of the exact boson sampling problem where the objective is to produce provably correct random samples from a particular quantum mechanical distribution . the computational framework was proposed by aaronson and arkhipov in 2011 as an attainable demonstration of ` quantum supremacy ' , that is a practical quantum computing experiment able to produce output at a speed beyond the reach of classical ( that is non - quantum ) computer hardware . since its introduction boson sampling has been the subject of intense international research in the world of quantum computing . on the face of it , the problem is challenging for classical computation . aaronson and arkhipov show that exact boson sampling is not efficiently solvable by a classical computer unless $ p^{\#p } = bpp^{np}$ and the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level . the fastest known exact classical algorithm for the standard boson sampling problem takes $ o({m + n -1 \choose n } n 2^n ) $ time to produce samples for a system with input size $ n$ and $ m$ output modes , making it infeasible for anything but the smallest values of $ n$ and $ m$. we give an algorithm that is much faster , running in $ o(n 2^n + \operatorname{poly}(m , n))$ time and $ o(m)$ additional space . the algorithm is simple to implement and has low constant factor overheads . as a consequence our classical algorithm is able to solve the exact boson sampling problem for system sizes far beyond current photonic quantum computing experimentation , thereby significantly reducing the likelihood of achieving near - term quantum supremacy in the context of boson sampling .
