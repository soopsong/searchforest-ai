we show that renyi entropies of subregions can be used to distinguish when the entire system is in a microcanonical ensemble from when it is in a canonical ensemble , at least in theories holographically dual to gravity . simple expressions are provided for these renyi entropies in a particular thermodynamic limit with high energy density and fixed fractional size of the subregion . holographically , the renyi entropies are determined by the areas of cosmic branes inserted into the bulk spacetime . they differ between a microcanonical and a canonical ensemble because the two ensembles provide different boundary conditions for the gravitational theory under which cosmic branes lead to different backreacted geometries . this is in contrast to the von neumann entropy which is more coarse - grained and does not differentiate microcanonical ensembles from canonical ensembles .
