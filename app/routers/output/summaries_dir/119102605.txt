in this work we focus on fluctuations of time - integrated observables for a particle diffusing in a one - dimensional periodic potential in the weak - noise asymptotics . our interest goes to rare trajectories presenting an atypical value of the observable , that we study through a biased dynamics in a large - deviation framework . we determine explicitly the effective probability - conserving dynamics which makes rare trajectories of the original dynamics become typical trajectories of the effective one . our approach makes use of a weak - noise path - integral description in which the action is minimised by the rare trajectories of interest . for ` current - type ' additive observables , we find the emergence of a propagative trajectory minimising the action for large enough deviations , revealing the existence of a dynamical phase transition at a fluctuating level . in addition , we provide a new method to determine the scaled cumulant generating function of the observable without having to optimise the action . it allows one to show that the weak - noise and the large - time limits commute in this problem . finally , we show how the biased dynamics can be mapped in practice to an effective driven dynamics , which takes the form of a driven langevin dynamics in an effective potential . the non - trivial shape of this effective potential is key to understand the link between the dynamical phase transition in the large deviations of current and the standard depinning transition of a particle in a tilted potential .
