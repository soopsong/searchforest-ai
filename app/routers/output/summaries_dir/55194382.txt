in this paper , we develop a simple model describing inherent photon - number noise in rarity - tapster type interferometers . this noise is caused by generating photon pairs in the process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion and adding a third photon by attenuating fundamental laser mode to single - photon level . we experimentally verify our model and present resulting signal to noise ratios as well as obtained three - photon generation rates as functions of various setup parameters . subsequently we evaluate impact of this particular source of noise on quantum teleportation which is a key quantum information protocol using this interferometric configuration .
