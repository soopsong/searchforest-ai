ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices self - organize into a variety of structural and quantum phases when placed into a single - mode cavity and pumped by a laser . cavity optomechanical effects induce an atom density modulation at the cavity - mode wave length that competes with the optical lattice arrangement . simultaneously short - range interactions via particle hopping promote superfluid order , such that a variety of structural and quantum coherent phases can occur . we analyze the emerging phase diagram in two dimensions by means of an extended bose - hubbard model using a local mean field approach combined with a superfluid cluster analysis . for commensurate ratios of the cavity and external lattice wave lengths the mott insulator - superfluid transition is modified by the appearance of charge density wave and supersolid phases , at which the atomic density supports the buildup of a cavity field . for incommensurate ratios , the optomechanical forces induce the formation of bose - glass and superglass phases , namely non - superfluid and superfluid phases , respectively , displaying quasi - periodic density modulations , which in addition can exhibit structural and superfluid stripe formation . the onset of such structures is constrained by the onsite interaction and is favourable at fractional densities . experimental observables are identified and discussed .
