we discuss a model of two nonlinear kerr - like oscillators , mutually coupled and excited by parametric process . we show that the system 's evolution , starting from werner - like states , remains closed within a small set of two - mode n - photon states the system , and pure two - qubit entangled state can be generated . for some initial werner - like states delayed entanglement generation can be observed . we investigate the influence of two damping mechanisms on the system 's evolution . we show that for the both cases , the entanglement can survive despite the presence of damping , and the effects of sudden entanglement death and its rebirth can appear in the system .
