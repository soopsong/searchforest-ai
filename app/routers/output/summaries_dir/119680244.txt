we introduce and investigate a family of entanglement - annihilating channels . these channels are capable of destroying any quantum entanglement within the system they act on . we show that they are not necessarily entanglement breaking . in order to achieve this result we analyze the subset of locally entanglement - annihilating channels . in this case , the same local noise applied on each subsystem individually is less entanglement annihilating ( with respect to multi - partite entanglement ) as the number of subsystems is increasing . therefore , the bipartite case provides restrictions on the set of local entanglement - annihilating channels for the multipartite case . the introduced concepts are illustrated on the family of single - qubit depolarizing channels .
