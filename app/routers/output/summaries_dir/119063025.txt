quantum teleportation of a continuous - variable state is studied for the quantum channel of a two - mode squeezed vacuum influenced by a thermal environment . each mode of the squeezed vacuum is assumed to undergo the same thermal influence . it is found that when the mixed two - mode squeezed vacuum for the quantum channel is separable , any nonclassical features , which may be imposed in an original unknown state , can not be transferred to a receiving station . a two - mode gaussian state , one of which is a mixed two - mode squeezed vacuum , is separable if and only if a positive well - defined $ p$ function can be assigned to it . the fidelity of teleportation is considered in terms of the noise factor given by the imperfect channel . it is found that quantum teleportation may give more noise than direct transmission of a field under the thermal environment , which is due to the fragile nature of quantum entanglement of the quantum channel .
