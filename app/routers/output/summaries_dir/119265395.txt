it is shown that an ideal measurement of a one - particle wave packet state of a relativistic quantum field in minkowski spacetime enables superluminal signalling . the result holds for a measurement that takes place over an intervention region in spacetime whose extent in time in some frame is longer than the light - crossing time of the packet in that frame . moreover , these results are shown to apply not only to ideal measurements but also to unitary transformations that rotate two orthogonal one - particle states into each other . in light of these observations , possible restrictions on the allowed types of intervention are considered . a more physical approach to such questions is to construct explicit models of the interventions as interactions between the field and other quantum systems such as detectors . the prototypical unruh - dewitt detector couples to the field operator itself and so most likely respects relativistic causality . on the other hand , detector models which couple to a finite set of frequencies of field modes are shown to lead to superluminal signalling . such detectors do , however , provide successful phenomenological models of atom - qubits interacting with quantum fields in a cavity but are valid only on time scales many orders of magnitude larger than the light - crossing time of the cavity .
