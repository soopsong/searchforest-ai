reliable qubits are difficult to engineer , but standard fault - tolerance schemes use seven or more physical qubits to encode each logical qubit , with still more qubits required for error correction . the large overhead makes it hard to experiment with fault - tolerance schemes with multiple encoded qubits . the 15-qubit hamming code protects seven encoded qubits to distance three . we give fault - tolerant procedures for applying arbitrary clifford operations on these encoded qubits , using only two extra qubits , 17 total . in particular , individual encoded qubits within the code block can be targeted . fault - tolerant universal computation is possible with four extra qubits , 19 total . the procedures could enable testing more sophisticated protected circuits in small - scale quantum devices . our main technique is to use gadgets to protect gates against correlated faults . we also take advantage of special code symmetries , and use pieceable fault tolerance .
