we present a communication protocol for chains of permanently coupled qubits which achieves perfect quantum state transfer and which is efficient with respect to the number chains employed in the scheme . the system consists of $ m$ uncoupled identical quantum chains . local control ( gates , measurements ) is only allowed at the sending / receiving end of the chains . under a quite general hypothesis on the interaction hamiltonian of the qubits a theorem is proved which shows that the receiver is able to asymptotically recover the messages by repetitive monitoring of his qubits .
