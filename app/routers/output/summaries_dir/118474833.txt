we introduce three tunable parameters to optimize the fidelity of quantum teleportation with continuous - variable in nonideal scheme . using the characteristic function formalism , we present the condition that the teleportation fidelity is independent of the amplitude of input coherent states for any entangled resource . then we investigate the effects of tunable parameters on the fidelity with or without the presence of environment and imperfect measurements , by analytically deriving the expression of fidelity for three different input coherent state distributions . it is shown that , for the linear distribution , the optimization with three tunable parameters is the best one with respect to single- and two - parameter optimization . our results reveal the usefulness of tunable parameters for improving the fidelity of teleportation and the ability against the decoherence .
