nmr quantum information processing studies rely on the reconstruction of the density matrix representing the so - called pseudo - pure states ( pps ) . an initially pure part of a pps state undergoes unitary and non - unitary ( relaxation ) transformations during a computation process , causing a"loss of purity"until the equilibrium is reached . besides , upon relaxation , the nuclear polarization varies in time , a fact which must be taken into account when comparing density matrices at different instants . attempting to use time - fixed normalization procedures when relaxation is present , leads to various anomalies on matrices populations . on this paper we propose a method which takes into account the time - dependence of the normalization factor . from a generic form for the deviation density matrix an expression for the relaxing initial pure state is deduced . the method is exemplified with an experiment of relaxation of the concurrence of a pseudo - entangled state , which exhibits the phenomenon of sudden death , and the relaxation of the wigner function of a pseudo - cat state .
