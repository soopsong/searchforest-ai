we study the rigidity properties of grassmannian frames : basis - like sets of unit vectors that correspond to optimal grassmannian line packings . it is known that grassmannian frames characterized by the welch bound must satisfy the restrictive geometric and spectral conditions of being both equiangular and tight ; however , less is known about the necessary properties of other types of grassmannian frames . we examine explicit low - dimensional examples of orthoplectic grassmannian frames and conclude that , in general , the necessary conditions for the existence of grassmannian frames can be much less restrictive . in particular , we exhibit a pair of $ 5$-element grassmannian frames in $ \mathbb c^2 $ manifesting with differently sized angle sets and different reconstructive properties ( ie , only one of them is a tight frame ) . this illustrates the complexity of the line packing problem , as there are cases where a solution may coexist with another solution of a different geometric and spectral character . nevertheless , we find that these"twin"instances still respect a certain rigidity , as there is a necessary trade - off between their tightness properties and the cardinalities of their angle sets . the proof of this depends on the observation that the traceless embedding of conway , hardin and sloane sends the vectors of a unit - norm , tight frame to a zero - summing set on a higher dimensional sphere . in addition , we review some of the known bounds for characterizing optimal line packings in $ \mathbb c^2 $ and discuss several examples of grassmannian frames achieving them .
