we consider an ideal experiment in which unlimited nonprojective quantum measurements are sequentially performed on a system that is initially entangled with a distant one . at each step of the sequence , the measurements are randomly chosen between two . however , regardless of which measurement is chosen or which outcome is obtained , the quantum state of the pair always remains entangled . we show that the classical simulation of the reduced state of the distant system requires not only unlimited rounds of communication , but also that the distant system has infinite memory . otherwise , a thermodynamical argument predicts heating at a distance . our proposal can be used for experimentally ruling out nonlocal finite - memory classical models of quantum theory .
