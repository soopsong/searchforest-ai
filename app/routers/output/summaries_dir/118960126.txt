we study the smoothness of the black hole horizon in the hayden - preskill thought experiment by using two particular toy models based on variants of haar random unitary . the first toy model corresponds to the case where the coarse - grained entropy of a black hole is larger than its entanglement entropy . we find that , while the outgoing mode and the remaining black hole are entangled , the hayden - preskill recovery can not be performed . the second toy model corresponds to the case where the system consists of low energy soft modes and high energy heavy modes . we find that the hayden - preskill recovery protocol can be carried out via soft modes whereas heavy modes give rise to classical correlations between the outgoing mode and the remaining black hole . we also point out that the procedure of constructing the interior partners of the outgoing soft mode operators can be interpreted as the hayden - preskill recovery , and as such , the known recovery protocol enables us to explicitly write down the interior operators . hence , while the infalling mode needs to be described jointly by the remaining black hole and the early radiation in our toy model , adding a few extra qubits from the early radiation is sufficient to reconstruct the interior operators .
