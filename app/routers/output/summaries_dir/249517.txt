we propose a general framework for solving quantum state estimation problems using the minimum relative entropy criterion . a convex optimization approach allows us to decide the feasibility of the problem given the data and , whenever necessary , to relax the constraints in order to allow for a physically admissible solution . building on these results , the variational analysis can be completed ensuring existence and uniqueness of the optimum . the latter can then be computed by standard , efficient standard algorithms for convex optimization , without resorting to approximate methods or restrictive assumptions on its rank .
