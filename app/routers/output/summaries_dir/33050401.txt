stimulated brillouin scattering has attracted renewed interest with the promise of highly tailorable integration into the silicon photonics platform . however , significant brillouin amplification in silicon waveguides has yet to be shown . in an effort to engineer a structure with large photon - phonon coupling , we analyzed both forward and backward brillouin scattering in high - index - contrast silicon slot waveguides . the calculations predict that gradient forces enhance the brillouin gain in narrow slots . we estimate a currently feasible gain of about $ 10^{5 } \ , \text{w}^{-1}\text{m}^{-1}$ , which is an order of magnitude larger than in a stand - alone silicon wire . such efficient coupling could enable a host of brillouin technologies on a mass - producible silicon chip .
