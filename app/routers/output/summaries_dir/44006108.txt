superconducting metamaterials combine the advantages of low - loss , large inductance ( with the addition of kinetic inductance ) , and extreme tunability compared to their normal metal counterparts . therefore , they allow realization of compact designs operating at low frequencies . we have recently developed radio frequency ( rf ) metamaterials with a high loaded quality factor and an electrical size as small as $ \sim$$\lambda$658 , ( $ \lambda$ is the free space wavelength ) by using nb thin films . the rf metamaterial is composed of truly planar spirals patterned with lithographic techniques . linear transmission characteristics of these metamaterials show robust lorentzian resonant peaks in the sub- 100 mhz frequency range below the $ t_c$ of nb . though nb is a non - magnetic material , the circulating currents in the spirals generated by rf signals produce a strong magnetic response , which can be tuned sensitively either by temperature or magnetic field thanks to the superconducting nature of the design . we have also observed strong nonlinearity and meta - stable jumps in the transmission data with increasing rf input power until the nb is driven into the normal state . we discuss the factors modifying the induced magnetic response from single and 1-d arrays of spirals in the light of numerical simulations .
