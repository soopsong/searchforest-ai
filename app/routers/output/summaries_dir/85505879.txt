we suggest a simple approach to populate photonic quantum materials at non - zero chemical potential and near - zero temperature . taking inspiration from forced evaporation in cold - atom experiments , the essential ingredients for our low - entropy thermal reservoir are ( a ) inter - particle interactions , and ( b ) energy - dependent loss . the resulting thermal reservoir may then be coupled to a broad class of hamiltonian systems to produce low - entropy quantum phases . we present an idealized picture of such a reservoir , deriving the scaling of reservoir entropy with system parameters , and then propose several practical implementations using only standard circuit quantum electrodynamics tools , and extract the fundamental performance limits . finally , we explore , both analytically and numerically , the coupling of such a thermalizer to the paradigmatic bose - hubbard chain , where we employ it to stabilize an $ n=1 $ mott phase . in this case , the performance is limited by the interplay of dynamically arrested thermalization of the mott insulator and finite heat capacity of the thermalizer , characterized by its repumping rate . this work explores a new approach to preparation of quantum phases of strongly interacting photons , and provides a potential route to topologically protected phases that are difficult to reach through adiabatic evolution .
