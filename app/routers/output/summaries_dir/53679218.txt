quantum walks are powerful tools for building quantum algorithms , modelling transport phenomena , and designing topological systems . here we present a photonic implementation of a quantum walk in two spatial dimensions , where the lattice of walker positions is encoded in the transverse - wavevector components of a paraxial light beam . the desired quantum dynamics is obtained by means of a sequence of liquid - crystal devices ( " g - plates " ) , which apply polarization - dependent transverse kicks to the photons in the beam . we first characterize our setup , and then benchmark it by implementing a periodically - driven chern insulator and probing its topological features . our platform is compact , versatile and cost - effective : most evolution parameters are controlled dynamically , the walker distribution is detected in a single shot , and the input state can be tailored at will . these features offer exciting prospects for the photonic simulation of two - dimensional quantum systems .
