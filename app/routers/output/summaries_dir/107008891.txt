clock synchronization between the ground and satellites is a fundamental issue in future quantum telecommunication , navigation , and global positioning systems . here , we propose a scheme of near - earth orbit satellite - based quantum clock synchronization with atmospheric dispersion cancellation by taking into account the spacetime background of the earth . two frequency entangled pulses are employed to synchronize two clocks , one at a ground station and the other at a satellite . the time discrepancy of the two clocks is introduced into the pulses by moving mirrors and is extracted by measuring the coincidence rate of the pulses in the interferometer . we find that the pulses are distorted due to effects of gravity when they propagate between the earth and the satellite , resulting in remarkably affected coincidence rates . we also find that the precision of the clock synchronization is sensitive to the source parameters and the altitude of the satellite . the scheme provides a solution for satellite - based quantum clock synchronization with high precision , which can be realized , in principle , with current technology .
