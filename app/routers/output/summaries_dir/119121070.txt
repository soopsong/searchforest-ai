we present a heisenberg operator based formulation of coherent quantum feedback and pyragas control . this model is easy to implement and allows for an efficient and fast calculation of the dynamics of feedback - driven observables as the number of contributing correlations grows in systems with a fixed number of excitations only linearly in time . furthermore , our model unravels the quantum kinetics of entanglement growth in the system by explicitly calculating non - markovian multi - time correlations , e.g. , how the emission of a photon is correlated with an absorption process in the past . therefore , the time - delayed differential equations are expressed in terms of insightful physical quantities . another considerate advantage of this method is its compatibility to typical approximation schemes , such as factorization techniques and the semi - classical treatment of coherent fields . this allows the application on a variety of setups , ranging from closed quantum systems in the few excitation regimes to open systems and pyragas control in general .
