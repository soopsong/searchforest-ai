the instantaneous quantum polynomial time model ( or the iqp model ) is one of promising models to demonstrate a quantum computational advantage over classical computers . if the iqp model can be efficiently simulated by a classical computer , an unlikely consequence in computer science can be obtained ( under some unproven conjectures ) . in order to experimentally demonstrate the advantage using medium or large - scale iqp circuits , it is inevitable to efficiently verify whether the constructed iqp circuits faithfully work . there exists two types of iqp models , each of which is the sampling on hypergraph states or weighted graph states . for the first - type iqp model , polynomial - time verification protocols have already been proposed . in this paper , we propose verification protocols for the second - type iqp model . to this end , we propose polynomial - time fidelity estimation protocols of weighted graph states for each of the following four situations where a verifier can ( i ) choose any measurement basis and perform adaptive measurements , ( ii ) only choose restricted measurement bases and perform adaptive measurements , ( iii ) choose any measurement basis and only perform non - adaptive measurements , and ( iv ) only choose restricted measurement bases and only perform non - adaptive measurements . in all of our verification protocols , the verifier 's quantum operations are only single - qubit measurements . since we assume no i.i.d . property on quantum states , our protocols work in any situation .
