recent proposals and advances in quantum simulations , quantum cryptography and quantum communications substantially rely on quantum entanglement formation . contrary to the conventional wisdom that dissipation destroys quantum coherence , coupling with a dissipative environment can also generate entanglement . we consider a system composed of two quantum dot qubits coupled with a common , damped surface plasmon mode ; each quantum dot is also coupled to a separate photonic cavity mode . cavity quantum electrodynamics calculations show that upon optical excitation by a femtosecond laser pulse , entanglement of the quantum dot excitons occurs , and the time evolution of the $ g^{(2)}$ pair correlation function of the cavity photons is an indicator of the entanglement . we also show that the degree of entanglement is conserved during the time evolution of the system . furthermore , if coupling of the photonic cavity and quantum dot modes is large enough , the quantum dot entanglement can be transferred to the cavity modes to increase the overall entanglement lifetime . this latter phenomenon can be viewed as a signature of entangled , long - lived quantum dot exciton - polariton formation . the preservation of total entanglement in the strong coupling limit of the cavity / quantum dot interactions suggests a novel means of entanglement storage and manipulation in high - quality optical cavities .
