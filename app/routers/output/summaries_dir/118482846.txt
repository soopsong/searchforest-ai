we study parametric interactions in a new type of nonlinear photonic structures , which is realized in the vicinity of a pair of nonlinear crystals . in this kind of structure , which we call binary , multiple nonlinear optical processes can be implemented simultaneously , owing to multiple phase - matching conditions , fulfilled separately in the constituent crystals . the coupling between the nonlinear processes by means of modes sharing similar frequency is attained by the spatially - broadband nature of the parametric fields . we investigate the spatial properties of the fields generated in the binary structure constructed from periodically poled crystals for the two examples : 1 ) single parametric down - conversion , and 2 ) coupled parametric down - conversion and up - conversion processes . the efficacy of the fields ' generation in these examples is analyzed through comparison with the cases of traditional single periodically poled crystal and aperiodic photonic structure , respectively . it has been shown that the relative shift between the periodic crystal lattices has a crucial effect on the generated spatial field spectrum and the overall efficiency . in addition , the influence of the inter - crystal distance on these characteristics has been studied . therefore , our study suggests that one can construct optical elements with sophisticated nonlinear properties from simpler elements without significant sacrifice of the efficacy .
