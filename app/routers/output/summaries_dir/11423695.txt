using cavity - enhanced non - degenerate parametric downconversion , we have built a frequency tunable source of heralded single photons with a narrow bandwidth of 8 mhz , making it compatible with atomic quantum memories . the photon state is 70 % pure single photon as characterized by a tomographic measurement and reconstruction of the quantum state , revealing a clearly negative wigner function . furthermore , it has a spectral brightness of ~1,500 photons / s per mhz bandwidth , making it one of the brightest single photon sources available . we also investigate the correlation function of the down - converted fields using a combination of two very distinct detection methods ; photon counting and homodyne measurement .
