in this work we analyze a quantum communication scheme for entanglement - based continuous variable quantum key distribution between two ground stations . communication occurs via a satellite over two independent atmospheric fading channels dominated by turbulence - induced beam wander . in this scheme the engineering complexity remains largely on the ground transceivers , with the satellite acting simply as a reflector . we show how the use of a highly selective post - selection strategy may lead to a useful quantum key generation rate for this system . this work represents the first quantitative assessment of continuous variable quantum key rates in the pragmatic scenario of reflection off low - earth - orbit satellites .
