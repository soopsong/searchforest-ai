studying mechanical resonators via radiation pressure offers a rich avenue for the exploration of quantum mechanical behavior in a macroscopic regime . however , quantum state preparation and especially quantum state reconstruction of mechanical oscillators remains a significant challenge . here we propose a scheme to realize quantum state tomography , squeezing and state purification of a mechanical resonator using short optical pulses . the scheme presented allows observation of mechanical quantum features despite preparation from a thermal state and is shown to be experimentally feasible using optical microcavities . our framework thus provides a promising means to explore the quantum nature of massive mechanical oscillators and can be applied to other systems such as trapped ions .
