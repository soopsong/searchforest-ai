the quantum computing scheme described in phys . rev . lett . 98 , 190504 ( 2007 ) , when viewed as a cluster state computation , features a 3-d cluster state , novel adjustable strength error correction capable of correcting general errors through the correction of z errors only , a threshold error rate approaching 1 % and low overhead arbitrarily long - range logical gates . in this work , we review the scheme in detail framing discussion solely in terms of the required 3-d cluster state and its stabilizers .
