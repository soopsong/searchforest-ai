quantum superdense coding protocols enhance channel capacity by using shared quantum entanglement between two users . the channel capacity can be as high as 2 when one uses entangled qubits . however , this limit can be surpassed by using high - dimensional entanglement . we report an experiment that exceeds the limit using high - quality entangled ququarts with fidelities up to 0.98 , demonstrating a channel capacity of $ 2.09\pm0.01$. the measured channel capacity is also higher than that obtained when transmitting only one ququart . we use the setup to transmit a five - color image with a fidelity of 0.952 . our experiment shows the great advantage of high - dimensional entanglement and will stimulate research on high - dimensional quantum information processes .
