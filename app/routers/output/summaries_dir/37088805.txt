we analyze the disorder - perturbed transport of quantum states in the absence of backscattering . this comprises , for instance , the propagation of edge - mode wave packets in topological insulators , or the propagation of photons in inhomogeneous media . we quantify the disorder - induced dephasing , which we show to be bound . moreover , we identify a gap condition to remain in the backscattering - free regime despite disorder - induced momentum broadening . our analysis comprises the full disorder - averaged quantum state , on the level of both populations and coherences , appreciating states as potential carriers of quantum information . the well - definedness of states is guaranteed by our treatment of the nonequilibrium dynamics with lindblad master equations .
