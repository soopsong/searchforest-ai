we give an example of a wide class of problems for which quantum information protocols based on multi - system entanglement can be mapped into much simpler ones involving one system . secret sharing is a cryptographic primitive which plays a central role in various secure multiparty computation tasks and management of keys in cryptography . in secret sharing protocols , a classical message is divided into shares given to recipient parties in such a way that some number of parties need to collaborate in order to reconstruct the message . quantum protocols for the task commonly rely on multi - partite ghz entanglement . we present a multiparty secret sharing protocol which requires only sequential communication of a single quantum d - level system ( for any prime d ) . it has huge advantages in scalabilility and can be realized with the state of the art technology . n be realized with the state of the art technology .
