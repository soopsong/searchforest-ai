i review the advancements of atomic scale nanoelectronics towards quantum neuromorphics . first , i summarize the key properties of elementary combinations of few neurons , namely long-- and short -- term plasticity , spike - timing dependent plasticity ( associative plasticity ) , quantumness and stochastic effects , and their potential computational employment . next , i review several atomic scale device technologies developed to control electron transport at the atomic level , including single atom implantation for atomic arrays and cmos quantum dots , single atom memories , ag$_2$s and cu$_2$s atomic switches , hafnium based rrams , organic material based transistors , ge$_2$sb$_2$te$_5 $ synapses . each material / method proved successful in achieving some of the properties observed in real neurons . i compare the different methods towards the creation of a new generation of naturally inspired and biophysically meaningful artificial neurons , in order to replace the rigid cmos based neuromorphic hardware . the most challenging aspect to address appears to obtain both the stochastic / quantum behavior and the associative plasticity , which are currently observed only below and above 20 nm length scale respectively , by employing the same material .
