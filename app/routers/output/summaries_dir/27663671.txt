we design and fabricate ultra - low - loss tapered optical fibers ( tofs ) with minimal lengths . we first optimize variations of the torch scan length using the flame - brush method for fabricating tofs with taper angles that satisfy the adiabaticity criteria . we accordingly fabricate tofs with optimal shapes and compare their transmission to tofs with a constant taper angle and tofs with an exponential shape . the highest transmission measured for tofs with an optimal shape is in excess of 99.7 % with a total tof length of only 23 mm , whereas tofs with a constant taper angle of 2 mrad reach 99.6 % transmission for a 63 mm tof length .
