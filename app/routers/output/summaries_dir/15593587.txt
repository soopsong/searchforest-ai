the dynamical equation of quantum mechanics are rewritten in form of dynamical equations for the measurable , positive marginal distribution of the shifted , rotated and squeezed quadrature introduced in the so called"symplectic tomography " . then the possibility of a purely classical description of a quantum system as well as a reinterpretation of the quantum measurement theory is discussed and a comparision with the well known quasi - probabilities approach is given . furthermore , an analysis of the properties of this marginal distribution , which contains all the quantum information , is performed in the framework of classical probability theory . finally examples of harmonic oscillator 's states dynamics are treated .
