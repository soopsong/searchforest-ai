we give graphical characterisation of the access structure to both classical and quantum information encoded onto a multigraph defined for prime dimension $ q$ , as well as explicit decoding operations for quantum secret sharing based on graph state protocols . we give a lower bound on $ k$ for the existence of a $ ( ( k , n))_q$ scheme and prove , using probabilistic methods , that there exists $ \alpha$ such that a random multigraph has an accessing parameter $ k\leq \alpha n$ with high probability .
