we report the possibility of completely destructive interference of three indistinguishable photons on a three port device providing a generalisation of the well known hong - ou - mandel interference of two indistinguishable photons on a two port device . our analysis is based on the underlying mathematical framework of su(3 ) transformations rather than su(2 ) transformations . we show the completely destructive three photon interference for a large range of parameters of the three port device and point out the physical origin of such interference in terms of the contributions from different quantum paths . as each output port can deliver zero to three photons the device generates higher dimensional entanglement . in particular , different forms of entangled states of qudits can be generated depending on the device parameters . our system is different from a symmetric three port beam splitter which does not exhibit a three photon hong - ou - mandel interference .
