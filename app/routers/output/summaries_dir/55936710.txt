we extend the concept of the negativity , a good measure of entanglement for bipartite pure states , to mixed states by means of the convex - roof extension . we show that the measure does not increase under local quantum operations and classical communication , and derive explicit formulae for the entanglement measure of isotropic states and werner states , applying the formalism presented by vollbrecht and werner [ phys . rev . a { \bf 64 } , 062307 ( 2001 ) ] .
