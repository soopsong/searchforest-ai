a future holographic screen is a hypersurface of indefinite signature , foliated by marginally trapped surfaces with area $ a(r)$. we prove that $ a(r)$ grows strictly monotonically . future holographic screens arise in gravitational collapse . past holographic screens exist in our own universe ; they obey an analogous area law . both exist more broadly than event horizons or dynamical horizons . working within classical general relativity , we assume the null curvature condition and certain generiticity conditions . we establish several nontrivial intermediate results . if a surface $ \sigma$ divides a cauchy surface into two disjoint regions , then a null hypersurface $ n$ that contains $ \sigma$ splits the entire spacetime into two disjoint portions : the future - and - interior , $ k^+$ ; and the past - and - exterior , $ k^-$. if a family of surfaces $ \sigma(r)$ foliate a hypersurface , while flowing everywhere to the past or exterior , then the future - and - interior $ k^+(r)$ grows monotonically under inclusion . if the surfaces $ \sigma(r)$ are marginally trapped , we prove that the evolution must be everywhere to the past or exterior , and the area theorem follows . a thermodynamic interpretation as a second law is suggested by the bousso bound , which relates $ a(r)$ to the entropy on the null slices $ n(r)$ foliating the spacetime . in a companion letter , we summarize the proof and discuss further implications .
