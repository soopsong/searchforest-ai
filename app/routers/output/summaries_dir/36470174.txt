an implementation of quantum absorption chillers with three qubits has been recently proposed , that is ideally able to reach the carnot performance regime . here we study the working efficiency of such self - contained refrigerators , adopting a consistent treatment of dissipation effects . we demonstrate that the coefficient of performance at maximum cooling power is upper bounded by 3/4 of the carnot performance . the result is independent of the details of the system and the equilibrium temperatures of the external baths . we provide design prescriptions that saturate the bound in the limit of a large difference between the operating temperatures . our study suggests that delocalized dissipation , which must be taken into account for a proper modelling of the machine - baths interaction , is a fundamental source of irreversibility which prevents the refrigerator from approaching the carnot performance arbitrarily closely in practice . the potential role of quantum correlations in the operation of these machines is also investigated .
