a field in the vacuum state , which is in principle separable , can evolve to an entangled state in a dynamical gravitational collapse . we will study , quantify , and discuss the origin of this entanglement , showing that it could even reach the maximal entanglement limit for low frequencies or very small black holes , with consequences in micro - black hole formation and the final stages of evaporating black holes . this entanglement provides quantum information resources between the modes in the asymptotic future ( thermal hawking radiation ) and those which fall to the event horizon . we will also show that fermions are more sensitive than bosons to this quantum entanglement generation . this fact could be helpful in finding experimental evidence of the genuine quantum hawking effect in analog models .
