an efficient and economical scheme is proposed for the perfect quantum teleportation of n - qubit non - maximally entangled state of generalized bell - type . a bell state is used as the quantum channel in the proposed scheme . it is also shown that the controlled teleportation of this n - qubit state can be achieved by using a ghz state or a ghz - like state as quantum channel . the proposed schemes are economical because for the perfect and controlled teleportation of n - qubit non - maximally entangled state of generalized bell - type we only need a bell state and a tripartite entangled state respectively . it is also established that there exists a family of 12 orthogonal tripartite ghz - like states which can be used as quantum channel for controlled teleportation . the proposed protocols are critically compared with the existing protocols .
