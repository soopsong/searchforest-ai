the conjunction of atom - cavity physics and photonic structures ( ` ` solid light ' ' systems ) offers new opportunities in terms of more device functionality and the probing of designed emulators of condensed matter systems . by analogy to the canonical one - electron approximation of solid state physics , we propose a one - polariton approximation to study these systems . using this approximation we apply bloch states to the uniformly tuned jaynes - cummings - hubbard model to analytically determine the energy band structure . by analyzing the response of the band structure to local atom - cavity control we explore its application as a quantum simulator and show phase transition features absent in mean field theory . using this novel approach for solid light systems we extend the analysis to include detuning impurities to show the solid light analogy of the semiconductor . this investigation also shows new features with no semiconductor analog .
