quantum phases of naturally - occurring systems exhibit distinctive collective phenomena as manifestation of their many - body correlations , in contrast to our persistent technological challenge to engineer at will such strong correlations artificially . here we show theoretically that quantum correlations exhibited in the two - dimensional valence bond solid phase of a quantum antiferromagnet , modeled by affleck , kennedy , lieb , and tasaki as a precursor of spin liquids and topological orders , are sufficiently complex yet structured enough to simulate universal quantum computation when every single spin can be measured individually . this unveils that an intrinsic complexity of naturally - occurring 2d quantum systems -- which has been a long - standing challenge for traditional computers -- could be tamed as a computationally valuable resource , even if we are limited not to create newly entanglement during computation . our constructive protocol leverages a novel way to herald the correlations suitable for deterministic quantum computation through a random sampling , and may be extensible to other ground states of various 2d valence bond phases beyond the aklt state .
