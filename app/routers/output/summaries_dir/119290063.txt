conditional preparation is a well - established technique for quantum state engineering of light . a general trend is to increase the number of heralding detection events in such realization to reach larger photon - number states or their arbitrary superpositions . in contrast to pulsed implementations , where detections only occur within the pulse window , for continuous - wave light the temporal separation of the conditioning detections is an additional degree of freedom and a critical parameter . based on the theoretical study by a.e.b . nielsen and k. molmer and on a continuous - wave two - mode squeezed vacuum from a nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator , we experimentally investigate the generation of two - photon state with tunable delay between the heralding events . the present work illustrates the temporal multimode features in play for conditional state generation based on continuous - wave light sources .
