we formulate an inseparability criterion based on the recently derived generalized schr\"odinger - robertson uncertainty relation ( srur ) [ ivan { \it et al . } j. phys . a : math . theor . { \bf 45 } , 195305 ( 2012 ) ] together with the negativity of partial transpose ( pt ) . this generalized srur systematically deals with two orthogonal quadrature amplitudes to higher - orders , so is relevant to characterize non - gaussian quantum statistics . we first present a method that relies on the single - mode marginal distribution of two - mode fields under pt followed by beam - splitting operation . we then extend the srur to two - mode cases and develop a full two - mode version of inseparability criterion . we find that our formulation can be useful to detect entanglement of non - gaussian states even when , e.g. , the entropic criterion that also involves higher - order moments fails .
