a critical step in quantum compilation is the transformation of a technology - independent quantum circuit into a technology - dependent form for a targeted device . in addition to mapping quantum gates into the supported gate set , it is necessary to map pseudo qubits in the technology - independent circuit into physical qubits of the technology - dependent circuit such that coupling constraints among qubits acting in multiple - qubit gates are satisfied . it is usually not possible to find such a mapping without adding swap gates into the circuit . to cope with the technical limitations of nisq - era quantum devices , it is advantageous to find a mapping that requires as few additional gates as possible . the large search space of possible mappings makes this task a difficult combinatorial optimization problem . in this work , we demonstrate how zero - suppressed decision diagrams ( zdds ) can be used for typical implementation tasks in quantum mapping algorithms . we show how to maximally partition a quantum circuit into blocks of adjacent gates , and if adjacent gates within a circuit do not share common mapping permutations , we attempt to combine them using parallelized swap operations represented in a zdd . boundaries for the partitions are formed where adjacent gates are unable to be combined . within each partition block , zdds represent all possible mappings of pseudo qubits to physical qubits .
