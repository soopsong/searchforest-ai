we present measurements of the cross - correlation function of photon pairs at 780 nm and 1367 nm , generated in a hot rubidium vapor cell . the temporal character of the biphoton is determined by the dispersive properties of the medium where the pair generation takes place . we show that short correlation times occur for optically thick samples , which can be understood in terms of off - resonant pair generation . by modifying the linear response of the sample , we produce near - resonant photon pairs , which could in principle be used for entanglement distribution .
