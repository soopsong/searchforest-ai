non - commutativity is one of the most elementary non - classical features of quantum observables . here we propose a method to detect non - commutativity of interaction hamiltonians of two probe objects coupled via a mediator . if these objects are open to their local environments , our method reveals non - decomposability of temporal evolution into a sequence of interactions between each probe and the mediator . the hamiltonians or lindblad operators can remain unknown throughout the assessment , we only require knowledge of the dimension of the mediator . furthermore , no operations on the mediator are necessary . technically , under the assumption of decomposable evolution , we derive upper bounds on correlations between the probes and then demonstrate that these bounds can be violated with correlation dynamics generated by non - commuting hamiltonians , e.g. , jaynes - cummings coupling . an intuitive explanation is provided in terms of multiple exchanges of a virtual particle which lead to the excessive accumulation of correlations . a plethora of correlation quantifiers are helpful in our method , e.g. , quantum entanglement , discord , mutual information , and even classical correlation . finally , we discuss exemplary applications of the method in quantum information : the distribution of correlations and witnessing dimension of an object .
