we put forward an effective amplification protocol for protecting the single - photon multi - mode w state of the time - bin qubit . the protocol only relies on linear optical elements , such as the $ 50:50 $ beam splitters , variable beam splitters with the transmission of $ t$ and the polarizing beam splitters . only one pair of the single - photon multi - mode w state and some auxiliary single photons are required , and the fidelity of the single - photon multi - mode w state can be increased under $ t<\frac{1}{2}$. the encoded time - bin information can be perfectly contained . our protocol is quite simple and economical , and it can be realized under current experimental condition . based on above features , it may be useful in current and future quantum information processing .
