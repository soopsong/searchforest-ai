we carry out a quantum - mechanical analysis of a small josephson junction coupled to a single - mode resonant cavity . we find that the eigenstates of the combined junction - cavity system are strongly entangled only when the gate voltage applied at one of the superconducting islands is tuned to certain special values . one such value corresponds to the resonant absorption of a single photon by cooper pairs in the junction . another special value corresponds to a { \em two - photon } absorption process . near the single - photon resonant absorption , the system is accurately described by a simplified model in which only the lowest two levels of the josephson junction are retained in the hamiltonian matrix . we noticed that this approximation does not work very well as the number of photons in the resonator increases . our system shows also the phenomenon of ` ` collapse and revival ' ' under suitable initial conditions , and our full numerical solution agrees with the two level approximation result .
