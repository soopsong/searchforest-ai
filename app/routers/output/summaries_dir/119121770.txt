since the discovery of hawking radiation , its consistency with quantum theory has been widely questioned . in the widely described picture , irrespective of what initial state a black hole starts with before collapsing , it eventually evolves into a thermal state of hawking radiations after the black hole is exhausted . this scenario violates the principle of unitarity as required for quantum mechanics and leads to the acclaimed"information loss paradox " . this paradox has become an obstacle or a reversed touchstone for any possible theory to unify the gravity and quantum mechanics . based on the results from hawking radiation as tunneling , we recently show that hawking radiations can carry off all information about the collapsed matter in a black hole . after discovering the existence of information - carrying correlation , we show in great detail that entropy is conserved for hawking radiation based on standard probability theory and statistics . we claim that information previously considered lost remains hidden inside hawking radiation . more specifically , it is encoded into correlations between hawking radiations . our study thus establishes harmony between harking radiation and the unitarity of quantum mechanics , which establishes the basis for a significant milestone towards resolving the long - standing information loss paradox . the paper provides a brief review of the exciting development on hawking raidation . in addition to summarize our own work on this subject , we compare and address other related studies .
