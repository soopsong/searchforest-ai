here we propose a solid - state quantum memory that does not require spectral holeburning , instead using strong rephasing pulses like traditional photon echo techniques . the memory uses external broadening fields to reduce the optical depth and so switch off the collective atom - light interaction when desired . the proposed memory should allow operation with reasonable efficiency in a much broader range of material systems , for instance er3 + doped crystals which have a transition at 1.5 um . we present analytic theory supported by numerical calculations and initial experiments .
