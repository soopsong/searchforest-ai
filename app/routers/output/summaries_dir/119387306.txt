motivated by the immense success of random walk and markov chain methods in the design of classical algorithms , we consider_quantum _ walks on graphs . we analyse in detail the behaviour of unbiased quantum walk on the line , with the example of a typical walk , the ` ` hadamard walk ' ' . we show that after t time steps , the probability distribution on the line induced by the hadamard walk is almost uniformly distributed over the interval [ -t / sqrt(2),t / sqrt(2 ) ] . this implies that the same walk defined on the circle mixes in_linear _ time . this is in direct contrast with the quadratic mixing time for the corresponding classical walk . we conclude by indicating how our techniques may be applied to more general graphs .
