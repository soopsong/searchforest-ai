we present and analyze a protocol in which polaritons in a noncoplanar optical cavity form fractional quantum hall states . we model the formation of these states and present techniques for subsequently creating anyons and measuring their fractional exchange statistics . in this protocol , we use a rapid adiabatic passage scheme to sequentially add polaritons to the system , such that the system is coherently driven from $ n$- to $ ( n+1)$-particle laughlin states . quasiholes are created by slowly moving local pinning potentials in from outside the cloud . they are braided by dragging the pinning centers around one another , and the resulting phases are measured interferometrically . the most technically challenging issue with implementing our procedure is that maintaining adiabaticity and coherence requires that the two - particle interaction energy $ v_0 $ be sufficiently large compared to the single - polariton decay rate $ \gamma$ , $ v_0 /\gamma \gg 10 n^2 \ln n$ , where $ n$ is the number of particles in the target state . while this condition is very demanding for present - day experiments where $ v_0 /\gamma\sim 50 $ , our protocol presents a significant advance over the existing protocols in the literature .
