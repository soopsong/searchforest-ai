we propose a robust scheme to prepare three - dimensional entanglement states between a single atom and a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) via stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) techniques . the atomic spontaneous radiation , the cavity decay , and the fiber loss are efficiently suppressed by the engineering adiabatic passage . our scheme is also robust to the variation of atom number in the bec .
