in this paper we will present a quantum algorithm which works very efficiently in case of multiple matches within the search space and in the case of few matches , the algorithm performs classically . this allows us to propose a hybrid quantum search engine that integrates grover 's algorithm and the proposed algorithm here to have general performance better that any pure classical or quantum search algorithm .
