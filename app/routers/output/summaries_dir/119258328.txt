we investigate the response of a harmonically confined mirror to an optical pulse in cavity optomechanics . we show that when the pulsed coupling strength takes the form of a chirped pulse , thermal fluctuations of the mirror can be significantly transferred to the cavity field . in addition , the frequency modulation of the pulse could enable a better cooling performance by suppressing the sensitivity of the dependence of detuning and pulse areas . using numerical investigations , we find that the pulsed - cooling is mainly limited by the cavity - field decay rate .
