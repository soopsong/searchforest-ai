resolving quantum many - body problems represents one of the greatest challenges in physics and physical chemistry , due to the prohibitively large computational resources that would be required by using classical computers . a solution has been foreseen by directly simulating the time evolution through sequences of quantum gates applied to arrays of qubits , i.e. by implementing a digital quantum simulator . superconducting circuits and resonators are emerging as an extremely - promising platform for quantum computation architectures , but a digital quantum simulator proposal that is straightforwardly scalable , universal , and realizable with state - of - the - art technology is presently lacking . here we propose a viable scheme to implement a universal quantum simulator with hybrid spin - photon qubits in an array of superconducting resonators , which is intrinsically scalable and allows for local control . as representative examples we consider the transverse - field ising model , a spin-1 hamiltonian , and the two - dimensional hubbard model ; for these , we numerically simulate the scheme by including the main sources of decoherence . in addition , we show how to circumvent the potentially harmful effects of inhomogeneous broadening of the spin systems .
