we apply our recent quantum approximate optimization algorithm to the combinatorial problem of bounded occurrence max e3lin2 . the input is a set of linear equations each of which contains exactly three boolean variables and each equation says that the sum of the variables mod 2 is 0 or is 1 . every variable is in no more than d equations . a random string will satisfy 1/2 of the equations . we show that the level one qaoa will efficiently produce a string that satisfies $ \left(\frac{1}{2 } + \frac{1}{101 d^{1/2}\ , l n\ , d}\right)$ times the number of equations . a recent classical algorithm achieved $ \left(\frac{1}{2 } + \frac{constant}{d^{1/2}}\right)$. we also show that in the typical case the quantum computer will output a string that satisfies $ \left(\frac{1}{2}+ \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3e}\ , d^{1/2}}\right)$ times the number of equations .
