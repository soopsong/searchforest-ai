we show that not all 4-party pure states are ghz reducible ( i.e. , can be generated reversibly from a combination of 2- , 3- and 4-party maximally entangled states by local quantum operations and classical communication asymptotically ) through an example , we also present some properties of the relative entropy of entanglement for those 3-party pure states that are ghz reducible , and then we relate these properties to the additivity of the relative entropy of entanglement .
