quantum dots embedded in photonic nanostructures have in recent years proven to be a very powerful solid - state platform for quantum optics experiments . the combination of near - unity radiative coupling of a single quantum dot to a photonic mode and the ability to eliminate decoherence processes imply that an unprecedented light - matter interface can be obtained . as a result , high - cooperativity photon - emitter quantum interfaces can be constructed opening a path - way to deterministic photonic quantum gates for quantum - information processing applications . in the present manuscript , i review current state - of - the - art on quantum dot devices and their applications for quantum technology . the overarching long - term goal of the research field is to construct photonic quantum networks where remote entanglement can be distributed over long distances by photons .
