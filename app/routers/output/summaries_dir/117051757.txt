two - photon processes have so far been considered only as resulting from frequency - matched second - order expansions of light - matter interaction , with consequently small coupling strengths . however , a variety of novel physical phenomena arises when such coupling values become comparable with the system characteristic frequencies . here , we propose a realistic implementation of two - photon quantum rabi and dicke models in trapped - ion technologies . in this case , effective two - phonon processes can be explored in all relevant parameter regimes . in particular , we show that an ion chain under bichromatic laser drivings exhibits a rich dynamics and highly counterintuitive spectral features , such as interaction - induced spectral collapse .
