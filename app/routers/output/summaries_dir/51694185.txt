we study the dynamics of a quantum system whose interaction with an environment is described by a collision model , i.e. the open dynamics is modelled through sequences of unitary interactions between the system and the individual constituents of the environment , termed"ancillas " , which are subsequently traced out . in this setting non - markovianity is introduced by allowing for additional unitary interactions between the ancillas . for this model , we identify the relevant system - environment correlations that lead to a non - markovian evolution . through an equivalent picture of the open dynamics , we introduce the notion of"memory depth"where these correlations are established between the system and a suitably sized memory rendering the overall system+memory evolution markovian . we extend our analysis to show that while most system - environment correlations are irrelevant for the dynamical characterization of the process , they generally play an important role in the thermodynamic description . finally , we show that under an energy - preserving system - environment interaction , a non - monotonic time behaviour of the heat flux serves as an indicator of non - markovian behaviour .
