the l\"uders rule provides a way to define a quantum channel given a quantum measurement . using this construction , we establish an if - and - only - if condition for the existence of a $ d$-dimensional symmetric informationally complete quantum measurement ( a sic ) in terms of a particular depolarizing channel . moreover , the channel in question satisfies two entropic optimality criteria .
