we present a practical classification scheme for the four - partite entangled states under stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) . by transforming a four - partite state into a triple - state set composed of two tripartite and one bipartite states , the entanglement classification is reduced to the classification of tripartite and bipartite entanglements . this reduction method has the merit of involving only the linear constrains , and meanwhile providing an insight into the entanglement character of the subsystems .
