quantum thermodynamics addresses the emergence of thermodynamical laws from quantum mechanics . the link is based on the intimate connection of quantum thermodynamics with the theory of open quantum systems . quantum mechanics inserts dynamics into thermodynamics giving a sound foundation to finite - time - thermodynamics . the emergence of the 0-law i - law ii - law and iii - law of thermodynamics from quantum considerations is presented . the emphasis is on consistence between the two theories which address the same subject from different foundations . we claim that inconsistency is the result of faulty analysis pointing to flaws in approximations .
