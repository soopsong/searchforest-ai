we consider two types of strongly disordered one - dimensional hamiltonian systems coupled to baths ( energy or particle reservoirs ) at the boundaries : strongly disordered quantum spin chains and disordered classical harmonic oscillators . these systems are believed to exhibit localization , implying in particular that the conductivity decays exponentially in the chain length $ l$. we ask however for the profile of the ( very slowly ) transported quantity in the steady state . we find that this profile is a step - function , jumping in the middle of the chain from the value set by the left bath to the value set by the right bath . the width of the step grows not faster than $ \sqrt{l}$. this is confirmed by numerics on a disordered quantum spin chain of 9 spins and on much longer chains of harmonic oscillators . in the case of harmonic oscillators , we also observe a drastic breakdown of local equilibrium at the step , resulting in a chaotic temperature profile .
