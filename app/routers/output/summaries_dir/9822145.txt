we study the problem of optimal leader selection in consensus networks with noisy relative information . the objective is to identify the set of $ k$ leaders that minimizes the formation 's deviation from the desired trajectory established by the leaders . an optimal leader set can be found by an exhaustive search over all possible leader sets ; however , this approach is not scalable to large networks . in recent years , several works have proposed approximation algorithms to the $ k$-leader selection problem , yet the question of whether there exists an efficient , non - combinatorial method to identify the optimal leader set remains open . this work takes a first step towards answering this question . we show that , in one - dimensional weighted graphs , namely path graphs and ring graphs , the $ k$-leader selection problem can be solved in polynomial time ( in both $ k$ and the network size $ n$ ) . we give an $ o(n^3)$ solution for optimal $ k$-leader selection in path graphs and an $ o(kn^3)$ solution for optimal $ k$-leader selection in ring graphs .
