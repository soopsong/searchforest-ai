small quantum systems can now be continuously monitored experimentally which allows for the reconstruction of quantum trajectories . a peculiar feature of these trajectories is the emergence of jumps between the eigenstates of the observable which is measured . using the stochastic master equation ( sme ) formalism for continuous quantum measurements , we show that the density matrix of a system indeed shows a jumpy behavior when it is subjected to a tight measurement ( even if the noise in the sme is gaussian ) . we are able to compute the jump rates analytically for any system evolution , i.e. any lindbladian , and we illustrate how our general recipe can be applied to two simple examples . we then discuss the mathematical , foundational and practical applications of our results . the analysis we present is based on a study of the strong noise limit of a class of stochastic differential equations ( the sme ) and as such the method may be applicable to other physical situations in which a strong noise limit plays a role .
