coupled quantum harmonic oscillators , studied by many authors using many different techniques over the decades , are frequently used toy - models to study open quantum systems . in this manuscript , we explicitly study the simplest oscillator model -- a pair of initially decoupled quantum harmonic oscillators interacting with a spring - like coupling , where the bath oscillator is initially in a thermal - like state . in particular , we treat the completely positive and trace preserving map on the system as a quantum channel , and study the truncation of the channel by truncating its kraus set and its output dimension . we thereby derive the truncated transition amplitudes of the corresponding truncated channel . finally , we give a computable approximation for these truncated transition amplitudes with explicit error bounds , and perform a case study of the oscillators in the off - resonant and weakly - coupled regime numerically . we demonstrate explicitly that the substantial leakage error can be mitigated via quantum error correction .
