we derive optimal periodic controls for entrainment of a self - driven oscillator to a desired frequency . the alternative objectives of minimizing power and maximizing frequency range of entrainment are considered . a state space representation of the oscillator is reduced to a linearized phase model , and the optimal periodic control is computed from the phase response curve using formal averaging and the calculus of variations . computational methods are used to calculate the periodic orbit and the phase response curve , and a numerical method for approximating the optimal controls is introduced . our method is applied to asymptotically control the period of spiking neural oscillators modeled using the hodgkin - huxley equations . this example illustrates the optimality of entrainment controls derived using phase models when applied to the original state space system .
