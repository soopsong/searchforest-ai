we use the dynamical invariants associated with the hamiltonian of an atom in a one dimensional moving trap to inverse engineer the trap motion and perform fast atomic transport without final vibrational heating . the atom is driven non - adiabatically through a shortcut to the result of adiabatic , slow trap motion . for harmonic potentials this only requires designing appropriate trap trajectories , whereas perfect transport in anharmonic traps may be achieved by applying an extra field to compensate the forces in the rest frame of the trap . the results can be extended to atom stopping or launching . the limitations due to geometrical constraints , energies and accelerations involved are analyzed , as well as the relation to previous approaches ( based on classical trajectories or"fast - forward"and"bang - bang"methods ) which can be integrated in the invariant - based framework .
