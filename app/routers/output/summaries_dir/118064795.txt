correlations in photodetection signals from quantum light sources are conventionally calculated by application of the source master equation and the quantum regression theorem . in this article we show how the conditioned dynamics , associated with the quantum theory of measurements , allows calculations and offers interpretations of the behaviour of the same quantities . our theory is illustrated for photon counting and field - amplitude measurements , and we show , in particular , how transient correlations between field - amplitude measurements and later photon counting events can be accounted for by a recently developed theory of past quantum states of a monitored quantum system .
