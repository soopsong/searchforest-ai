matrix product states can be defined as the family of quantum states that can be sequentially generated in a one - dimensional system . we introduce a new family of states which extends this definition to two dimensions . like in matrix product states , expectation values of few body observables can be efficiently evaluated and , for the case of translationally invariant systems , the correlation functions decay exponentially with the distance . we show that such states are a subclass of projected entangled pair states and investigate their suitability for approximating the ground states of local hamiltonians .
