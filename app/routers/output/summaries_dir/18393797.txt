we present equivalent circuits that model the interaction of microwave resonators and quantum systems . the circuit models are derived from a general interaction hamiltonian . quantitative agreement between the simulated resonator transmission frequency , qubit lamb shift and experimental data will be shown . we demonstrate that simple circuit models , using only linear passive elements , can be very useful in understanding systems where a small quantum system is coupled to a classical microwave apparatus .
