we present a dynamic learning paradigm for"programming"a general quantum computer . a learning algorithm is used to find the control parameters for a coupled qubit system , such that the system at an initial time evolves to a state in which a given measurement corresponds to the desired operation . this can be thought of as a quantum neural network . we first apply the method to a system of two coupled superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) , and demonstrate learning of both the classical gates xor and xnor . training of the phase produces a gate congruent to the cnot modulo a phase shift . striking out for somewhat more interesting territory , we attempt learning of an entanglement witness for a two qubit system . simulation shows a reasonably successful mapping of the entanglement at the initial time onto the correlation function at the final time for both pure and mixed states . for pure states this mapping requires knowledge of the phase relation between the two parts ; however , given that knowledge , this method can be used to measure the entanglement of an otherwise unknown state . the method is easily extended to multiple qubits or to qunits .
