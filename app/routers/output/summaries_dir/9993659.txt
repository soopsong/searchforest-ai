we investigate the mean - field dynamics of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) described by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) in a double - well potential with particle gain and loss , rendering the system pt - symmetric . the stationary solutions of the system show a change from elliptically stable behavior to hyperbolically unstable behavior caused by the appearance of pt - broken solutions of the gpe and influenced by the nonlinear interaction . the dynamical behavior is visualized using the bloch sphere formalism . however , the dynamics is not restricted to the surface of the sphere due to the nonlinear and non - hermitian nature of the system .
