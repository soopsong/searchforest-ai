quantum mechanics and general relativity have been each successfully tested in numerous experiments . however , the regime where both theories are jointly required to explain physical phenomena remains untested by laboratory experiments , and is also not fully understood by theory . this contribution reviews recent ideas for a new type of experiments : quantum interference of"clocks " , which aim to test novel quantum effects that arise from time dilation . "clock"interference experiments could be realised with atoms or photons in near future laboratory experiments .
