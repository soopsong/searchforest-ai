we propose a scheme to deterministically generate greenberger - horne - zeilinger states of $ n\geq 3 $ atoms trapped in spatially separated cavities connected by optical fibers . the scheme is based on the technique of fractional stimulated raman adiabatic passage which is one - step in the sense that one needs just wait for the desired entangled state to be generated in the stationary regime . the parametrized shapes of the rabi frequencies of the classical fields that drive the two end atoms are chosen appropriately to realize the scheme . we also show numerically that the proposed scheme is insensitive to the fluctuations of the pulses ' parameters and , at the same time , robust against decoherence caused by the dissipation due to fiber decay . moreover , a relatively high fidelity can be obtained even in the presence of cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission .
