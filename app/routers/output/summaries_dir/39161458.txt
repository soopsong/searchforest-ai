silicon - based quantum - computer architectures have attracted attention because of their promise for scalability and their potential for synergetically utilizing the available resources associated with the existing si technology infrastructure . electronic and nuclear spins of shallow donors ( e.g. phosphorus ) in si are ideal candidates for qubits in such proposals due to the relatively long spin coherence times . for these spin qubits , donor electron charge manipulation by external gates is a key ingredient for control and read - out of single - qubit operations , while shallow donor exchange gates are frequently invoked to perform two - qubit operations . more recently , charge qubits based on tunnel coupling in p$_2^+$ substitutional molecular ions in si have also been proposed . we discuss the feasibility of the building blocks involved in shallow donor quantum computation in silicon , taking into account the peculiarities of silicon electronic structure , in particular the six degenerate states at the conduction band edge . we show that quantum interference among these states does not significantly affect operations involving a single donor , but leads to fast oscillations in electron exchange coupling and on tunnel - coupling strength when the donor pair relative position is changed on a lattice - parameter scale . these studies illustrate the considerable potential as well as the tremendous challenges posed by donor spin and charge as candidates for qubits in silicon .
