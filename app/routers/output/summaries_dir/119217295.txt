there has been much interest in developing methods for transferring quantum information . we discuss a way to transfer quantum information between two trapped ions through a wire . the motion of a trapped ion induces oscillating charges in the trap electrodes . by sending this current to the electrodes of a nearby second trap , the motions of ions in the two traps are coupled . we investigate the electrostatics of a set - up where two separately trapped ions are coupled through an electrically floating wire . we also discuss experimental issues , including possible sources of decoherence .
