a solar cell is a heat engine , but textbook treatments are not wholly satisfactory from a thermodynamic standpoint , since they present solar cells as directly converting the energy of light into electricity , and the current in the circuit as maintained by an electrostatic potential . we propose a thermodynamic cycle in which the gas of electrons in the p phase serves as the working substance . the interface between the p and n phases acts as a self - oscillating piston that modulates the absorption of heat from the photons so that it may perform a net positive work during a complete cycle of its motion , in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics . we draw a simple hydrodynamical analogy between this model and the"putt - putt " ' engine of toy boats , in which the interface between the water 's liquid and gas phases serves as the piston . we point out some testable consequences of this model .
