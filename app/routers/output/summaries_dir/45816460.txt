quantum communication is a prime space technology application and offers near - term possibilities for long - distance quantum key distribution ( qkd ) and experimental tests of quantum entanglement . however , there exists considerable developmental risks and subsequent costs and time required to raise the technological readiness level of terrestrial quantum technologies and to adapt them for space operations . the small - space revolution is a promising route by which synergistic advances in miniaturization of both satellite systems and quantum technologies can be combined to leap - frog conventional space systems development . here , we outline a recent proposal to perform orbit - to - ground transmission of entanglement and qkd using a cubesat platform deployed from the international space station ( iss ) . this ambitious mission exploits advances in nanosatellite attitude determination and control systems ( adcs ) , miniaturised target acquisition and tracking sensors , compact and robust sources of single and entangled photons , and high - speed classical communications systems , all to be incorporated within a 10 kg 6 litre mass - volume envelope . the cubesat quantum communications mission ( cqucom ) would be a pathfinder for advanced nanosatellite payloads and operations , and would establish the basis for a constellation of low - earth orbit trusted - nodes for qkd service provision .
