a novel two - stage helium buffer gas cooled beam source is introduced . the properties of the molecular beams produced from this source are investigated theoretically using the caf as a test molecule . the gas phase molecules are first produced inside a 3~k helium buffer gas cell by laser ablation and subsequently cooled down to 3~k by collisions with buffer gas atoms . the precooled molecules are then extracted into the 0.5~k helium buffer gas cell where they are cooled further down to 0.5~k by collisions with cold helium atoms . finally , the cold molecules are extracted out into the high vacuum through the 0.5~k cell exit aperture and form a molecular beam . the mean forward velocity and the flux of the molecular beams are calculated to be 45~m / s and 8$\times$10$^{12}$ molecules per pulse respectively , when both cells are operated in the so - called hydrodynamic entrainment regime . the calculations further indicate that the mean forward velocity of the beam can be reduced below 25~m / s whilst maintaining the beam flux over 10$^{10}$ molecules per pulse by operating the helium buffer gas cell in the so - called diffusive regime . these calculations are well supported by helium flow - field simulations . combining this source with moving trap decelerators paves the way for an efficient magneto - optical trapping of the molecules and performing ultrahigh precision measurements .
