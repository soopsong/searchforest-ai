we argue that the entanglement of purification for two dimensional holographic cft can be obtained from conformal blocks with internal twist operators . first , we explain our formula from the view point of tensor network model of holography . then , we apply it to bipartite mixed states dual to subregion of ads${}_3 $ and the static btz blackhole geometries . the formula in cft agrees with the entanglement wedge cross section in the bulk , which has been recently conjectured to be equivalent to the entanglement of purification .
