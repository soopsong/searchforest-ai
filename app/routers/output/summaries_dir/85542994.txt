towards realising larger scale quantum algorithms , the ability to prepare sizeable multi - qubit entangled states with full qubit control is used as a benchmark for quantum technologies . we investigate the extent to which entanglement is found within a prepared graph state on the 20-qubit superconducting quantum computer , ibm q poughkeepsie . we prepared a graph state along a path consisting of all twenty qubits within poughkeepsie and performed full quantum state tomography on all groups of four connected qubits along this path . we determined that each pair of connected qubits was inseparable and hence the prepared state was entangled . additionally , a genuine multipartite entanglement witness was measured on all qubit subpaths of the graph state and we found genuine multipartite entanglement on chains of up to three qubits .
