this paper deals with quon algebras or deformed oscillator algebras , for which the deformation parameter is a root of unity . we show the interest of such algebras for fractional supersymmetric quantum mechanics , angular momentum theory and quantum information . more precisely , quon algebras are used for ( i ) a realization of a generalized weyl - heisenberg algebra from which it is possible to associate a fractional supersymmetric dynamical system , ( ii ) a polar decomposition of su_2 and ( iii ) a construction of mutually unbiased bases in hilbert spaces of prime dimension . we also briefly discuss ( symmetric informationally complete ) positive operator valued measures in the spirit of ( iii ) .
