in nature , instances of synchronisation abound across a diverse range of environments . in the quantum regime , however , synchronisation is typically observed by identifying an appropriate parameter regime in a specific system . in this work we show that this need not be the case , identifying symmetry - based conditions which , when satisfied , guarantee completely synchronous , entangled limit cycles between the individual constituents of a generic open quantum system - no restrictions are placed on its microscopic details . we describe these systems as posssessing a strong dynamical symmetry and we prove that , to first order , they are completely robust to symmetry - breaking perturbations . using these ideas we identify two central examples where synchronisation arises via this qualitatively new mechanism : a chain of quadratically dephased spin-1s and the many - body charge - dephased hubbard model . in both cases , due to their dynamical symmetries , perfect phase - locking occurs throughout the system , regardless of the specific microscopic parameters or initial states . furthermore , when these systems are perturbed , their non - linear responses elicit long - lived signatures of both phase and frequency - locking .
