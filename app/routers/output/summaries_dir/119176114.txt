three - level atomic gradient echo memory ( lambda - gem ) is a proposed candidate for efficient quantum storage and for linear optical quantum computation with time - bin multiplexing . in this paper we investigate the spatial multimode properties of a lambda - gem system . using a high - speed triggered ccd , we demonstrate the storage of complex spatial modes and images . we also present an in - principle demonstration of spatial multiplexing by showing selective recall of spatial elements of a stored spin wave . using our measurements , we consider the effect of diffusion within the atomic vapour and investigate its role in spatial decoherence . our measurements allow us to quantify the spatial distortion due to both diffusion and inhomogeneous control field scattering and compare these to theoretical models .
