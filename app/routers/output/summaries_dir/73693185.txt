all the $ n(2n+3)$ mean and covariance parameters of an $ n$-mode gaussian states are expressed in terms of the expectation values of the same number of conjugates of the total number observable . this permits a complete tomography of the state . the same is applied to outputs of a gaussian channel corresponding to selected coherent states to perform the complete tomography of the channel . this leads to some interesting problems concerning the distribution of the number operator and also tomographic complexity .
