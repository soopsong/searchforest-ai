we simulate the process of continuous homodyne detection of the radiative emission from a quantum system , and we investigate how a bayesian analysis can be employed to determine unknown parameters that govern the system evolution . measurement back - action quenches the system dynamics at all times and we show that the ensuing transient evolution is more sensitive to system parameters than the steady state of the system . the parameter sensitivity can be quantified by the fisher information , and we investigate numerically and analytically how the temporal noise correlations in the measurement signal contribute to the ultimate sensitivity limit of homodyne detection .
