we propose an experimental realization of a time crystal using an atomic bose - einstein condensate in a high finesse optical cavity pumped with laser light detuned to the blue side of the relevant atomic resonance . by mapping out the dynamical phase diagram , we identify regions in parameter space showing stable limit cycle dynamics . since the model describing the system is time - independent , the emergence of a limit cycle phase indicates the breaking of continuous time translation symmetry . employing a semiclassical analysis to demonstrate the robustness of the limit cycles against perturbations and quantum fluctuations , we establish the emergence of a time crystal .
