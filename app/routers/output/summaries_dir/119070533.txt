in magnetically ordered systems the breaking of su(2 ) symmetry in the thermodynamic limit is associated with the appearance of a special type of low - lying excitations in finite size energy spectra , the so called tower of states ( tos ) . in the present work we numerically demonstrate that there is a correspondence between the su(2 ) tower of states and the lower part of the ground state entanglement spectrum ( es ) . using state - of - the - art dmrg calculations , we examine the es of the 2d antiferromagnetic j1-j2 heisenberg model on both the triangular and kagom\'e lattice . at large ferromagnetic j2 the model exhibits a magnetically ordered ground state . correspondingly , its es contains a family of low - lying levels that are reminiscent of the energy tower of states . their behavior ( level counting , finite size scaling in the thermodynamic limit ) sharply reflects tower of states features , and is characterized in terms of an effective entanglement hamiltonian that we provide . at large system sizes tos levels are divided from the rest by an entanglement gap . our analysis suggests that ( tos ) entanglement spectroscopy provides an alternative tool for detecting and characterizing su(2)-broken phases using dmrg .
