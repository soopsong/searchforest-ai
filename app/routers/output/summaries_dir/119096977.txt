the hypothesis testing problem of two quantum states is treated . we show a new inequality between the error of the first kind and the second kind , which complements the result of hiai and petz to establish the quantum version of stein 's lemma . the inequality is also used to show a bound on the first kind error when the power exponent for the second kind error exceeds the quantum relative entropy , and the bound yields the strong converse in the quantum hypothesis testing . finally , we discuss the relation between the bound and the power exponent derived by han and kobayashi in the classical hypothesis testing .
