this chapter describes the application of lasers , specifically diode lasers , in the area of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) . first , we motivate the distribution of cryptographic keys based on quantum physical properties of light , give a brief introduction to qkd assuming the reader has no or very little knowledge about cryptography , and briefly present the state - of - the - art of qkd . in the second half of the chapter we describe , as an example of a real - world qkd system , the system deployed between the university of calgary and sait polytechnic . we conclude the chapter with a brief discussion of quantum networks and future steps .
