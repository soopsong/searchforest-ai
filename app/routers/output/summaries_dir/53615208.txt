for multiqubit densities , the tensor of coherences ( or stokes tensor ) is a real parameterization obtained by the juxtaposition of the affine bloch vectors of each qubit . while it maintains the tensorial structure of the underlying space , it highlights the pattern of correlations , both classical and quantum , between the subsystems and , due to the affine parameterization , it contains in its components all reduced densities of all orders . the main purpose of our use of this formalism is to deal with entanglement . for example , the detection of bipartite entanglement is straightforward , as it is the synthesis of densities having positive partial transposes between desired qubits . in addition , finding explicit mixtures for families of separable states becomes a feasible issue for few qubit symmetric densities ( we compute it for werner states ) and , more important , it provides some insight on the possible origin of entanglement for such densities .
