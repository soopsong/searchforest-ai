this work focuses on modeling of time - varying covariance matrices using the state covariance of linear stochastic systems . following concepts from optimal mass transport and the schr\"odinger bridge problem ( sbp ) , we investigate several covariance paths induced by different regularizations on the system matrices . specifically , one of the proposed covariance path generalizes the geodesics based on the fisher - rao metric to the situation with stochastic input . another type of covariance path is generated by linear system matrices with rotating eigenspace in the noiseless situation . the main contributions of this paper include the differential equations for these covariance paths and the closed - form expressions for scalar - valued covariance . we also compare these covariance paths using several examples .
