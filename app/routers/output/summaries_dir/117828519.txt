we develop an abstract look at linear optical networks from the viewpoint of combinatorics and permanents . in particular we show that calculation of matrix elements of unitarily transformed photonic multi - mode states is intimately linked to the computation of permanents . an implication of this remarkable fact is that all calculations that are based on evaluating matrix elements are generically computationally hard . moreover , quantum mechanics provides simpler derivations of certain matrix analysis results which we exemplify by showing that the permanent of any unitary matrix takes its values across the unit disk in the complex plane .
