in this paper we consider the dvali and g\'omez assumption that the end state of a gravitational collapse is a bose - einstein condensate of gravitons . we then construct the two gross - pitaevskii equations for a static and spherically symmetric configuration of the condensate . these two equations correspond to the constrained minimisation of the gravitational hamiltonian with respect to the redshift and the newtonian potential , per given number of gravitons . we find that the effective geometry of the condensate is the one of a gravastar ( a desitter star ) with a sub - planckian cosmological constant , for masses larger than the planck scale . thus , a condensate corresponding to a semiclassical black hole , is always quantum and weakly coupled . finally , we obtain that the boundary of our gravastar , although it is not the location of a horizon , corresponds to the schwarzschild radius .
