we study different architectures for a photonic crystal in the microwave regime based on superconducting transmission lines interrupted by josephson junctions , both in one and two dimensions . a study of the scattering properties of a single junction in the line shows that the junction behaves as a perfect mirror when the photon frequency matches the josephson plasma frequency . we generalize our calculations to periodic arrangements of junctions , demonstrating that they can be used for tunable band engineering , forming what we call a quantum circuit crystal . two applications are discussed in detail . in a two - dimensional structure we demonstrate the phenomenon of negative refraction . we finish by studying the creation of stationary entanglement between two superconducting qubits interacting through a disordered media .
