using a bang - bang optimal control ( bb ) technique , we transfer polarization from abundant high-$\gamma$ nuclei directly to singlet order . this approach is analogous to algorithmic cooling ( ac ) procedure used in quantum state purification . specifically , we apply this method for enhancing the singlet order in a natural abundant $ ^{13}$c-$^{13}$c spin pair using a set of nine equivalent protons of an 11-spin system . compared to the standard method not involving polarization transfer , we find an enhancement of singlet order by about three times . in addition , since the singlet magnetization is contributed by the faster relaxing protons , the recycle delay is halved . thus effectively we observe a sensitivity enhancement by 4.2 times or a reduction in the overall experimental time by a factor of 18 . we also discuss a possible extension of ac , known as heat - bath algorithmic cooling ( hbac ) .
