taking recent experiments as examples , we discuss the conditions for sub - wavelength probing of optical field structures by single trapped atoms . we calculate the achievable resolution , highlighting its connection to the fringe visibility in an interference experiment . we show that seemingly different physical pictures , such as spatial averaging , phase modulation , and which - way information , describe the situation equally and lead to identical results . the connection to bohr 's moving slit experiment is pointed out .
