the collective interference of partially distinguishable bosons in multi - mode networks is studied via double - sided feynman diagrams . the probability for many - body scattering events becomes a multi - dimensional tensor - permanent , which interpolates between distinguishable particles and identical bosons , and easily extends to mixed initial states . the permanent of the distinguishability matrix , composed of all mutual scalar products of the single - particle mode - functions , emerges as a natural measure for the degree of interference : it yields a bound on the difference between event probabilities for partially distinguishable bosons and the idealized species , and exactly quantifies the degree of bosonic bunching .
