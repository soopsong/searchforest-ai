we demonstrate electromagnetic quantum states of single photons and of correlated photon pairs exhibiting"hybrid"entanglement between spin and orbital angular momentum . these states are obtained from entangled photon pairs emitted by spontaneous parametric down conversion , by employing a $ q$-plate for coupling the spin and orbital degrees of freedom of a photon . entanglement and contextual quantum behavior ( that is also non - local , in the case of photon pairs ) is demonstrated by the reported violation of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt inequality . in addition a classical analog of the hybrid spin - orbit photonic entanglement is reported and discussed .
