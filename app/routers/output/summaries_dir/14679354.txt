the observation of quantized nanomechanical oscillations by detecting femtometer - scale displacements is a significant challenge for experimentalists . we propose that phonon blockade can serve as a signature of quantum behavior in nanomechanical resonators . in analogy to photon blockade and coulomb blockade for electrons , the main idea for phonon blockade is that the second phonon can not be excited when there is one phonon in the nonlinear oscillator . to realize phonon blockade , a superconducting quantum two - level system is coupled to the nanomechanical resonator and is used to induce the phonon self - interaction . using monte carlo simulations , the dynamics of the induced nonlinear oscillator is studied via the cahill - glauber $ s$-parametrized quasiprobability distributions . we show how the oscillation of the resonator can occur in the quantum regime and demonstrate how the phonon blockade can be observed with currently accessible experimental parameters .
