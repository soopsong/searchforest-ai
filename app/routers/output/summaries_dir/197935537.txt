we demonstrate conversion of up to 4.5 ghz - frequency microwaves to 1500 nm - wavelength light using optomechanical interactions on suspended thin - film lithium niobate . our method utilizes an interdigital transducer that drives a free - standing 100 $ \mu$m - long thin - film acoustic resonator to modulate light travelling in a mach - zehnder interferometer or racetrack cavity . owing to the strong microwave - to - acoustic coupling offered by the transducer in conjunction with the strong photoelastic , piezoelectric , and electro - optic effects of lithium niobate , we achieve a half - wave voltage of $ v_\pi$ = 4.6 v and $ v_\pi$ = 0.77 v for the mach - zehnder interferometer and racetrack resonator , respectively . the acousto - optic racetrack cavity exhibits an optomechancial single - photon coupling strength of 1.1 khz . our integrated nanophotonic platform coherently leverages the compelling properties of lithium niobate to achieve microwave - to - optical transduction . to highlight the versatility of our system , we also demonstrate a lossless microwave photonic link , which refers to a 0 db microwave power transmission over an optical channel .
