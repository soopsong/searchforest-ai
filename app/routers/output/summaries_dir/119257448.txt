quantum simulation of many - body systems are one of the most interesting tasks of quantum technology . among them is the preparation of a many - body system in its ground state when the vanishing energy gap makes the cooling mechanisms ineffective . adiabatic theorem , as an alternative to cooling , can be exploited for driving the many - body system to its ground state . in this paper , we study two most common disorders in quantum dot arrays , namely exchange coupling fluctuations and hyperfine interaction , in adiabatically preparation of ground state in such systems . we show that the adiabatic ground state preparation is highly robust against those disorder effects making it good analog simulator . moreover , we also study the adiabatic classical information transfer , using singlet - triplet states , across a spin chain . in contrast to ground state preparation the transfer mechanism is highly affected by disorder and in particular , the hyperfine interaction is very destructive for the performance . this suggests that for communication tasks across such arrays adiabatic evolution is not as effective and quantum quenches could be preferable .
