we study a model of a two - level system ( i.e. a qubit ) in interaction with the electromagnetic field . by means of homodyne detection , one field - quadrature is observed continuously in time . due to the interaction , information about the initial state of the qubit is transferred into the field , thus influencing the homodyne measurement results . we construct random variables ( pointers ) on the probability space of homodyne measurement outcomes having distributions close to the initial distributions of sigma - x and sigma - z . using variational calculus , we find the pointers that are optimal . these optimal pointers are very close to hitting the bound imposed by heisenberg 's uncertainty relation on joint measurement of two non - commuting observables . we close the paper by giving the probability densities of the pointers .
