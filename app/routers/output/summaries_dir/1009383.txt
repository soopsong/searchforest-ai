boson sampling is a computational task strongly believed to be hard for classical computers , but efficiently solvable by orchestrated bosonic interference in a specialised quantum computer . current experimental schemes , however , are still insufficient for a convincing demonstration of the advantage of quantum over classical computation . a new variation of this task , scattershot boson sampling , leads to an exponential increase in speed of the quantum device , using a larger number of photon sources based on parametric downconversion . this is achieved by having multiple heralded single photons being sent , shot by shot , into different random input ports of the interferometer . here we report the first scattershot boson sampling experiments , where six different photon - pair sources are coupled to integrated photonic circuits . we employ recently proposed statistical tools to analyse our experimental data , providing strong evidence that our photonic quantum simulator works as expected . this approach represents an important leap toward a convincing experimental demonstration of the quantum computational supremacy .
