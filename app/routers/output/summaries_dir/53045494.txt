a ( $ t$ , $ n$ ) threshold quantum secret sharing ( qss ) is proposed based on a single $ d$-level quantum system . it enables the ( $ t$ , $ n$ ) threshold structure based on shamir 's secret sharing and simply requires sequential communication in $ d$-level quantum system to recover secret . besides , the scheme provides a verification mechanism which employs an additional qudit to detect cheats and eavesdropping during secret reconstruction , and allows a participant to use the share repeatedly . analyses show that the proposed scheme is resistant to typical attacks . moreover , the scheme is salable in participant number and easier to realize compared to related schemes . more generally , our scheme also presents a generic method to construct new ( $ t$ , $ n$ ) threshold qss schemes based on $ d$-level quantum system from other classical threshold secret sharing .
