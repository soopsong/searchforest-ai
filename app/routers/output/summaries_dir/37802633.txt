entangled coherent states can be prepared remotely by subtracting non - locally a single photon from two quantum superpositions of coherent states , the so - called"schroedinger 's cat"state . such entanglement can further be distributed over longer distances by successive entanglement swapping operations using linear optics and photon - number resolving detectors . the aim of this paper is to evaluate the performance of this approach to quantum repeaters for long distance quantum communications . despite many attractive features at first sight , we show that , when using state - of - the - art photon counters and quantum memories , they do not achieve higher entanglement generation rates than repeaters based on single - photon entanglement . we discuss potential developments which may take better advantage of the richness of entanglement based on continuous variables , including in particular efficient parity measurements .
