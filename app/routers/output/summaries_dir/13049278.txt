there appears a universal logarithmic term of entanglement entropy , i.e. , $ -a(\omega ) \log(h/\delta)$ , for 3d cfts when the entangling surface has a sharp corner . $ a(\omega)$ is a function of the corner opening angle and behaves as $ a(\omega\to \pi)\simeq \sigma ( \pi-\omega)^2 $ and $ a(\omega\to 0)\simeq \kappa/\omega$ , respectively . recently , it is conjectured that $ \sigma / c_t=\pi^2/24 $ , where $ c_t$ is central charge in the stress tensor correlator , is universal for general cfts in three dimensions . in this paper , by applying the general higher curvature gravity , we give a holographic proof of this conjecture . we also clarify some interesting problems . firstly , we find that , in contrast to $ \sigma / c_t$ , $ \kappa / c_t$ is not universal . secondly , the lower bound $ a_e(\omega)/c_t$ associated to einstein gravity can be violated by higher curvature gravity . last but not least , we find that there are similar universal laws for cfts in higher dimensions . we give some holographic tests of these new conjectures .
