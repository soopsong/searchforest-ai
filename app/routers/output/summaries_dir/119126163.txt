the evolution of the centre - of - mass wave - function for a mesoscopic particle according to the schr\"odinger - newton equation can be approximated by a harmonic potential , if the wave - function is narrow compared to the size of the particle . it was noticed by colin et al . [ phys . rev . a , 93 , 062102 ( 2016 ) ] that , in the regime where self - gravitational effects are weak , intermediate and wider wave - functions may be approximated by a harmonic potential as well , but with a width dependent coupling , leading to a time evolution that is determined only by a differential equation for the width of a gaussian wave - function as a single parameter . such an approximation results in considerably less computational effort in order to predict the self - gravitational effects on the wave - function dynamics . here , we provide an alternative approach to this kind of approximation , including a rigorous derivation of the equations of motion for an initially gaussian wave packet , under the assumption that its shape is conserved . our result deviates to some degree from the result by colin et al . , specifically in the limit of wide wave - functions .
