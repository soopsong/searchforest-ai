in this paper , we investigate decoherence of knill , laflamme , and milburn 's nonlinear sign - shift gate that is implemented with the jaynes - cummings model . introducing a stochastic variable as an external electric field , we let it couple with a dipole moment of a two - level atom . we examine this model using a semiclassical theory . results of the monte carlo simulations under the semiclassical approximation correspond well with those obtained with the quantum mechanical perturbation theory for the stochastic process . in the results of the simulations , we observe both the $ \mbox{t}_{1}$ and $ \mbox{t}_{2}$ decays . this paper is a sequel to the reference [ h.~azuma , prog . theor . phys . { \bf 126 } , 369 ( 2011 ) ] .
