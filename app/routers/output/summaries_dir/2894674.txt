a fully - connected qubit network is considered , where every qubit interacts with every other one . when the interactions between the qubits are homogeneous , the system is a special case of the finite lipkin - meshkov - glick model . we propose a natural implementation of this model using superconducting qubits in state - of - the - art circuit qed . the ground state , the low - lying energy spectrum and the dynamical evolution are investigated . we find that , under realistic conditions , highly entangled states of greenberger - horne - zeilinger and w types can be generated . we also comment on the influence of disorder on the system and discuss the possibility of simulating complex quantum systems , such as sherrington - kirkpatrick spin glasses , with superconducting qubit networks .
