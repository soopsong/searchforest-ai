we study the validity of landauer principle in the non - markovian regime by means of collision models where the intracollisions inside the reservoir cause memory effects generating system - environment correlations . we adopt the system - environment correlations created during the dynamical process to assess the effect of non - markovianity on the landauer principle . exploiting an exact equality for the entropy change of the system , we find the condition for the violation of the landauer principle , which occurs when the established system - environment correlations become larger than the entropy production of the system . we then generalize the study to the non - equilibrium situation where the system is surrounded by many reservoirs at different temperatures.our results , verified through collision models with heisenberg - type interactions , suggest that the complexity of the environment does not play a significant role in the qualitative mechanisms underlying the violation of the landauer principle under non - markovian processes .
