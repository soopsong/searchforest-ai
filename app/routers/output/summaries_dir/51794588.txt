we discuss a simple yet surprisingly effective mechanism which allows the generation of squeezed output light from an optomechanical cavity . in contrast to the well known mechanism of"ponderomotive squeezing " , our scheme generates squeezed output light by explicitly using the dissipative nature of the mechanical resonator . we show that our scheme has many advantages over ponderomotive squeezing ; in particular , it is far more effective in the good cavity limit commonly used in experiments . furthermore , the squeezing generated in our approach can be directly used to enhance the intrinsic measurement sensitivity of the optomechanical cavity ; one does not have to feed the squeezed light into a separate measurement device . as our scheme is very general , it could also e.g. be implemented using superconducting circuits .
