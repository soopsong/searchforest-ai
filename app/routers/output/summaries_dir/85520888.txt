motivated by the observation of multiphoton electric dipole spin resonance processes in inas nanowires , we theoretically study the transport dynamics of a periodically driven five - level system , modeling the level structure of a two - electron double quantum dot . we show that the observed multiphoton resonances , which are dominant near interdot charge transitions , are due to multilevel landau - zener - stuckelberg - majorana interference . here a third energy level serves as a shuttle that transfers population between the two resonant spin states . by numerically integrating the master equation we replicate the main features observed in the experiments : multiphoton resonances ( as large as 8 photons ) , a robust odd - even dependence , and oscillations in the electric dipole spin resonance signal as a function of energy level detuning .
