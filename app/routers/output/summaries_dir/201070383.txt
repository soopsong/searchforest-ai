we show that a configuration of four birefringent crystals and wave - plates can emulate almost any arbitrary unital channel for polarization qubits encoded in single photons , where the channel settings are controlled by the wave - plate angles . the scheme is applied to a single spatial mode and its operation is independent of the wavelength and the fine temporal properties of the input light . we implemented the scheme and demonstrated its operation by applying a dephasing environment to classical and quantum single - photon states with different temporal properties . the applied process was characterized by a quantum process tomography procedure , and a high fidelity to the theory was observed .
