this paper proposes a resolution of the delayed - choice paradox of the conventional theory of quantum mechanics , where a particle seems to know what will happen in the future , and changes its present behavior accordingly . a comparison of the conventional theory with an advanced theory and a symmetrical theory of the same delayed - choice experiment suggests that the apparent paradox is caused by an incorrect assumption about the interaction of a wavefunction with a beam - splitter . once this assumption is corrected , there is no delayed - choice paradox in any of the three theories .
