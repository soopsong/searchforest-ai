we investigate the evolution of a target qubit caused by its multiple random collisions with $ n$-qubit clusters . depending on the cluster state , the evolution of the target qubit may correspond to its effective interaction with a thermal bath , a coherent ( laser ) drive , or a squeezed bath . in cases where the target qubit relaxes to a thermal state its dynamics can exhibit a quantum advantage , whereby the target - qubit temperature can be scaled up proportionally to $ n^2 $ and the thermalization time can be shortened by a similar factor , provided the appropriate coherence in the cluster is prepared by non - thermal means . we dub these effects quantum super - thermalization due to its analogies to super - radiance . experimental realizations of these effects are suggested .
