integrated quantum photonic waveguide circuits are a promising approach to realizing future photonic quantum technologies . here , we present an integrated photonic quantum technology platform utilising the silicon - on - insulator material system , where quantum interference and the manipulation of quantum states of light are demonstrated in components orders of magnitude smaller than in previous implementations . two - photon quantum interference is presented in a multi - mode interference coupler , and manipulation of entanglement is demonstrated in a mach - zehnder interferometer , opening the way to an all - silicon photonic quantum technology platform .
