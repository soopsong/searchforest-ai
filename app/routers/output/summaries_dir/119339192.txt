we propose a general framework to study transformations that drive an underdamped brownian particle in contact with a thermal bath from an equilibrium state to a new one in an arbitrarily short time . to this end , we make use of a time and space - dependent potential , that plays a dual role : confine the particle , and manipulate the system . in the special case of an isothermal compression or decompression of a harmonically trapped particle , we derive explicit protocols that perform this quick transformation , following an inverse engineering method . we focus on the properties of these protocols , which crucially depend on two key dimensionless numbers that characterize the relative values of the three timescales of the problem , associated with friction , oscillations in the confinement and duration of the protocol . in particular , we show that our protocols encompass the known overdamped version of this problem and extend it to any friction for decompression and to a large range of frictions for compression .
