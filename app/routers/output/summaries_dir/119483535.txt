we generalize the operational quasiprobability involving sequential measurements proposed by ryu { \em et al . } [ phys . rev . a { \bf 88 } , 052123 ] to a continuous - variable system . the quasiprobabilities in quantum optics are incommensurate , i.e. , they represent a given physical observation in different mathematical forms from their classical counterparts , making it difficult to operationally interpret their negative values . our operational quasiprobability is { \em commensurate } , enabling one to compare quantum and classical statistics on the same footing . we show that the operational quasiprobability can be negative against the hypothesis of macrorealism for various states of light . quadrature variables of light are our examples of continuous variables . we also compare our approach to the glauber - sudarshan $ \mathcal{p}$ function . in addition , we suggest an experimental scheme to sequentially measure the quadrature variables of light .
