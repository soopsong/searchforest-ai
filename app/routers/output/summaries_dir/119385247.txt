preparation of entangled steady states via dissipation and pumping in rydberg atoms has been recently found to be useful for quantum information processing . the driven - dissipative dynamics is closely related to the natural linewidth of the rydberg states and can be usually modulated by engineering the thermal reservior . instead of modifying the effectively radiative decay , we propose an alternatively optimized scheme , which combines the resonant rydberg antiblockade excitation and the lyapunov control of the ground states to speed up the prepration of the singlet state for two interacting rydberg atoms . the acceleration process strongly depends on the initial state of the system with respect to the initial coherence between the singlet state and decoherence - sensitive bright state . we study the optimal parameter regime for fast entanglement preparation and the robustness of the fidelity against random noises . the numerical results show that a fidelity above 0.99 can be achieved around 0.4 ms with the current experimental parameters . the scheme may be generalized for preparation of more complicate multi - atom entangled states .
