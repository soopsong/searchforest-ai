fiber fabry - perot cavities , formed by micro - machined mirrors on the end - facets of optical fibers , are used in an increasing number of technical and scientific applications , where they typically require precise stabilization of their optical resonances . here , we study two different approaches to construct fiber fabry - perot resonators and stabilize their length for experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics with neutral atoms . a piezo - mechanically actuated cavity with feedback based on the pound - drever - hall locking technique is compared to a novel rigid cavity design that makes use of the high passive stability of a monolithic cavity spacer and employs thermal self - locking and external temperature tuning . furthermore , we present a general analysis of the mode matching problem in fiber fabry - perot cavities , which explains the asymmetry in their reflective line shapes and has important implications for the optimal alignment of the fiber resonators . finally , we discuss the issue of fiber - generated background photons . we expect that our results contribute towards the integration of high - finesse fiber fabry - perot cavities into compact and robust quantum - enabled devices in the future .
