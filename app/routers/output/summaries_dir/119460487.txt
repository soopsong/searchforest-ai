it is shown that the time - averaged dynamics of memristors and their networks periodically driven by alternating - polarity pulses may converge to fixed - point attractors . starting with a general memristive system model , we derive basic equations describing the fixed - point attractors and investigate attractors in the dynamics of ideal , threshold - type and second - order memristors , and memristive networks . a memristor potential function is introduced , and it is shown that in some cases the attractor identification problem can be mapped to the problem of potential function minimization . importantly , the fixed - point attractors may only exist if the function describing the internal state dynamics depends on an internal state variable . our findings may be used to tune the states of analog memristors , and also be relevant to memristive synapses subjected to forward- and back - propagating spikes .
