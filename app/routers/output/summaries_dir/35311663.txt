we study the entanglement between the internal ( spin ) and external ( position ) degrees of freedom of the one - dimensional discrete time quantum walk starting from local and delocalized initial states whose time evolution is driven by hadamard and fourier coins . we obtain the dependence of the asymptotic entanglement with the initial dispersion of the state and establish a way to connect the asymptotic entanglement between local and delocalized states . we find out that the delocalization of the state increases the number of initial spin states which achieves maximal entanglement from two states ( local ) to a continuous set of spin states ( delocalized ) given by a simple relation between the angles of the initial spin state . we also carry out numerical simulations of the average entanglement along the time to confront with our analytical results .
