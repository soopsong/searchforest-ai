a new geometric representation of qubit and qutrit states based on probability simplexes is used to describe the separability and entanglement properties of density matrices of two qubits . the peres -- horodecki positive partial transpose ( ppt)-criterion and the concurrence inequalities are formulated as the conditions that the introduced probability distributions must satisfy to present entanglement . a four - level system , where one or two states are inaccessible , is considered as an example of applying the elaborated probability approach in an explicit form . the areas of three triadas of malevich 's squares for entangled states of two qubits are defined through the qutrit state , and the critical values of the sum of their areas are calculated . we always find an interval for the sum of the square areas , which provides the possibility for an experimental checkup of the entanglement of the system in terms of the probabilities .
