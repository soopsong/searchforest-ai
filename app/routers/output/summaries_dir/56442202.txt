we explore protocols for three - state adiabatic passage where the tunnel matrix elements are varied digitally , rather than smoothly as is the case with conventional adiabatic passage . in particular , we focus on the stirap and related three - state schemes where the control is applied stepwise , with either equal spaced levels for the tunnel matrix elements or uniform pulse lengths . our results show that the evolution typically shows the hallmarks of conventional adiabatic passage , although with additional resonances exhibiting no state transfer .
