we study a circuit qed setup where multiple superconducting qubits are ultrastrongly coupled to a single radio - frequency resonator . in this extreme parameter regime of cavity qed the dynamics of the electromagnetic mode is very slow compared to all other relevant timescales and can be described as an effective particle moving in an adiabatic energy landscape defined by the qubits . the focus of this work is placed on settings with two or multiple qubits , where different types of symmetry - breaking transitions in the ground- and excited - state potentials can occur . specifically , we show how the change in the level structure and the wave packet dynamics associated with these transition points can be probed via conventional excitation spectra and ramsey measurements performed at ghz frequencies . more generally , this analysis demonstrates that state - of - the - art circuit qed systems can be used to access a whole range of particle - like quantum mechanical phenomena beyond the usual paradigm of coupled qubits and oscillators .
