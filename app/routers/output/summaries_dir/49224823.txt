surface codes reach high error thresholds when decoded with known algorithms , but the decoding time will likely exceed the available time budget , especially for near - term implementations . to decrease the decoding time , we reduce the decoding problem to a classification problem that a feedforward neural network can solve . we investigate quantum error correction and fault tolerance at small code distances using neural network - based decoders , demonstrating that the neural network can generalize to inputs that were not provided during training and that they can reach similar or better decoding performance compared to previous algorithms . we conclude by discussing the time required by a feedforward neural network decoder in hardware .
