we study the creation of photons in a one dimensional oscillating cavity with two perfectly conducting moving walls . by means of a conformal transformation we derive a set of generalized moore 's equations whose solution contains the whole information of the radiation field within the cavity . for the case of resonant oscillations we solve these equations using a renormalization group procedure that appropriately deals with the secular behaviour present in a naive perturbative approach . we study the time evolution of the energy density profile and of the number of created photons inside the cavity .
