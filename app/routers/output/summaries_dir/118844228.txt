we consider a quantum emitter ( " atom " ) radiating in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) photonic waveguide in the presence of a single mirror , resulting in a delay differential equation for the atomic amplitude . we carry out a systematic analysis of the non - markovian ( nm ) character of the atomic dynamics in terms of refined , recently developed notions of quantum non - markovianity such as indivisibility and information back - flow . nm effects are quantified as a function of the round - trip time and phase shift associated with the atom - mirror optical path . we find , in particular , that unless an atom - photon bound state is formed a finite time delay is always required in order for nm effects to be exhibited . this identifies a finite threshold in the parameter space , which separates the markovian and non - markovian regimes .
