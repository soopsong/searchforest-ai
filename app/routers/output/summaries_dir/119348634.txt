we present a theory of quantum optical control of an electron spin in a single semiconductor quantum dot via spin - flip raman transitions . we show how an arbitrary spin rotation may be achieved by virtual excitation of discrete or continuum trion states . the basic physics issues of the appropriate adiabatic optical pulses in a static magnetic field to perform the single qubit operation are addressed .
