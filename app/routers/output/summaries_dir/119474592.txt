the superposition of quantum states lies at the heart of physics and has been recently found to serve as a versatile resource for quantum information protocols , defining the notion of quantum coherence . in this contribution , we report on the implementation of its complementary concept , coherence from quantum measurements . by devising an accessible criterion which holds true in any classical statistical theory , we demonstrate that noncommutative quantum measurements violate this constraint , rendering it possible to perform an operational assessment of the measurement - induced quantum coherence . in particular , we verify that polarization measurements of a single photonic qubit , an essential carrier of one unit of quantum information , are already incompatible with classical , i.e. , incoherent , models of a measurement apparatus . thus , we realize a method which enables us to quantitatively certify that quantum measurements follow fundamentally different statistical laws than expected from classical theories and , at the same time , quantify the usefulness within the modern framework of resources for quantum information technology .
