we demonstrate that dynamical noncommutative space - time will give rise to deformed oscillator algebras . in turn , starting from some q - deformations of these algebras in a two dimensional space for which the entire deformed fock space can be constructed explicitly , we derive the commutation relations for the dynamical variables in noncommutative space - time . we compute minimal areas resulting from these relations , i.e. finitely extended regions for which it is impossible to resolve any substructure in form of measurable knowledge . the size of the regions we find is determined by the noncommutative constant and the deformation parameter q. any object in this type of space - time structure has to be of membrane type or in certain limits of string type .
