optimal synthesis of reversible functions is a non - trivial problem . one of the major limiting factors in computing such circuits is the sheer number of reversible functions . even restricting synthesis to 4-bit reversible functions results in a huge search space ( 16!~2 ^ 44 functions ) . the output of such a search alone , counting only the space required to list toffoli gates for every function , would require over 100 terabytes of storage . in this paper , we present an algorithm that synthesizes an optimal circuit for any 4-bit reversible specification . we employ several techniques to make the problem tractable . we report results from several experiments , including synthesis of random 4-bit permutations , optimal synthesis of all 4-bit linear reversible circuits , synthesis of existing benchmark functions , and distribution of optimal circuits . our results have important implications for the design and optimization of quantum circuits , testing circuit synthesis heuristics , and performing experiments in the area of quantum information processing .
