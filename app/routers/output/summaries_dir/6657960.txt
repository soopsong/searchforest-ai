we propose a high - dimensional quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocol that employs temporal correlations of entangled photons . the security of the protocol relies on measurements by alice and bob in one of two conjugate bases , implemented using dispersive optics . we show that this dispersion - based approach is secure against general coherent attacks . the protocol is additionally compatible with standard fiber telecommunications channels and wavelength division multiplexers . we offer multiple implementations to enhance the transmission rate and describe a heralded qudit source that is easy to implement and enables secret - key generation at up to 100 mbps at over 2 bits per photon .
