quantum game theory is a multidisciplinary field which combines quantum mechanics with game theory by introducing non - classical resources such as entanglement , quantum operations and quantum measurement . by transferring two - player - two strategy ( 2x2 ) dilemma containing classical games into quantum realm , dilemmas can be resolved in quantum pure strategies if entanglement is distributed between the players who use quantum operations . moreover , players receive the highest sum of payoffs available in the game , which are otherwise impossible in classical pure strategies . encouraged by the observation of rich dynamics of physical systems with many interacting parties and the power of entanglement in quantum versions of 2x2 games , it became generally accepted that quantum versions can be easily extended to n - player situations by simply allowing n - partite entangled states . in this article , however , we show that this is not generally true because the reproducibility of classical tasks in quantum domain imposes limitations on the type of entanglement and quantum operators . we propose a benchmark for the evaluation of quantum and classical versions of games , and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a physical realization . we give examples of entangled states that can and can not be used , and the characteristics of quantum operators used as strategies .
