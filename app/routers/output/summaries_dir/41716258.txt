silicon avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) are sensitive to operating temperature fluctuations and are also susceptible to radiation flux expected in satellite - based quantum experiments . we introduce a low power voltage adjusting mechanism to overcome the effects of in - orbit temperature fluctuations . we also present data on the performance of si apds after irradiation ( gamma - ray and proton beam ) . combined with an analysis of expected orbital irradiation , we propose that a si apd in a 400 km equatorial orbit may operate beyond the lifetime of the satellite .
