when studying entropy functions of multivariate probability distributions , polymatroids and matroids emerge . entropy functions of pure multiparty quantum states give rise to analogous notions , called here polyquantoids and quantoids . polymatroids and polyquantoids are related via linear mappings and duality . quantum secret sharing schemes that are ideal are described by selfdual matroids . expansions of integer polyquantoids to quantoids are studied and linked to that of polymatroids .
