quantum measurement is universal for quantum computation . two models for performing measurement - based quantum computation exist : the one - way quantum computer was introduced by briegel and raussendorf , and quantum computation via projective measurements only by nielsen . the more recent development of this second model is based on state transfers instead of teleportation . from this development , a finite but approximate quantum universal family of observables is exhibited , which includes only one two - qubit observable , while others are one - qubit observables . in this article , an infinite but exact quantum universal family of observables is proposed , including also only one two - qubit observable . the rest of the paper is dedicated to compare these two models of measurement - based quantum computation , i.e. one - way quantum computation and quantum computation via projective measurements only . from this comparison , which was initiated by cirac and verstraete , closer and more natural connections appear between these two models . these close connections lead to a unified view of measurement - based quantum computation .
