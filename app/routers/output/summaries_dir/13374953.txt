we consider the problem of minimizing resources required for universal quantum computation using only projective measurements . the resources we focus on are observables , which describe projective measurements , and ancillary qubits . we show that the set of observables { z \otimes x , ( cos\theta)x + ( sin\theta)y all \theta \in [ 0 , 2\pi ) } with one ancillary qubit is universal for quantum computation . the set is simpler than a previous one in the sense that one - qubit projective measurements described by the observables in the set are ones only in the ( x , y ) plane of the bloch sphere . the proof of the universality immediately implies a simple set of observables that is approximately universal for quantum computation . moreover , the proof implies a simple set of observables for preparing graph states efficiently .
