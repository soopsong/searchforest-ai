this paper studies a scheme of two spatially distant oscillator systems that are connected by gaussian fields and examines distributed entanglement generation between two continuous - mode output gaussian fields that are radiated by the oscillators . it is demonstrated that using measurement - feedback control while a non - local effective entangling operation is on can help to enhance the einstein - podolski - rosen ( epr)-like entanglement between the output fields . the effect of propagation delays and losses in the fields interconnecting the two oscillators , and the effect of other losses in the system , are also considered . in particular , for a range of time delays the measurement feedback controller is able to maintain stability of the closed - loop system and the entanglement enhancement , but the achievable enhancement is only over a smaller bandwidth that is commensurate with the length of the time delays .
