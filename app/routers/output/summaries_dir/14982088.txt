a strong photon - photon nonlinear interaction is a necessary condition for photon blockade . moreover , this nonlinearity can also result a bistable behavior in the cavity field . we analyze the relation between detecting field and photon blockade in a superconducting circuit qed system , and show that photon blockade can not occur when the detecting field is in the bistable regime . this photon blockade is the microwave - photonics analog of the coulomb blockade . we further demonstrate that the photon transmission through such system can be controlled ( from photon blockade to transparency ) by the detecting field . numerical calculations show that our proposal is experimentally realizable with current technology .
