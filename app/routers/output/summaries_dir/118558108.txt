we present a calculation of the rate of information release from a schwarzschild bh . we have recently extended hawking 's theory of black hole ( bh ) evaporation to account for quantum fluctuations of the background geometry , as well as for back - reaction and time - dependence effects . our main result has been a two - point function matrix for the radiation that consists of hawking 's thermal matrix plus off - diagonal corrections that are initially small and become more important as the evaporation proceeds . here , we show that , if the phases and amplitudes of the radiation matrix are recorded over the lifetime of the bh , then the radiation purifies in a continuous way . we conjecture that our results establish the maximal rate at which information can be released from a semiclassical bh , to be contrasted with the minimal rate that was predicted by page on the basis of generic unitarity arguments . when the phases of the radiation matrix are not tracked , we show that it purifies only parametrically close to the end of the bh evaporation and does so extremely fast . our main technical tool in the quantitative treatment of this purification is the purity of the radiation matrix and , its inverse , the participation ratio . these can be related to the renyi entropy of the density matrix of the emitted radiation .
