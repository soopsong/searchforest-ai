we investigate the performance of linear consensus algorithms subject to a scaling of the underlying network size . specifically , we model networked systems with $ n^{\text{th}}$ order integrator dynamics over families of undirected , weighted graphs with bounded nodal degrees . in such networks , the algebraic connectivity affects convergence rates , sensitivity , and , for high - order consensus ( $ n \ge 3 $ ) , stability properties . this connectivity scales unfavorably in network size , except in expander families , where consensus performs well regardless of network size . we show , however , that consensus over expander families is fragile to a grounding of the network ( resulting in leader - follower consensus ) . we show that grounding may deteriorate system performance by orders of magnitude in large networks , or cause instability in high - order consensus . our results , which we illustrate through simulations , also point to a fundamental limitation to the scalability of consensus networks with leaders , which does not apply to leaderless networks .
