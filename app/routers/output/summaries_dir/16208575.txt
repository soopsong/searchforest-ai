suppose that we are given a quantum computer programmed ready to perform a computation if it is switched on . counterfactual computation is a process by which the result of the computation may be learnt without actually running the computer . such processes are possible within quantum physics and to achieve this effect , a computer embodying the possibility of running the computation must be available , even though the computation is , in fact , not run . we study the possibilities and limitations of general protocols for the counterfactual computation of decision problems ( where the result r is either 0 or 1 ) . if p(r ) denotes the probability of learning the result r ` ` for free ' ' in a protocol then one might hope to design a protocol which simultaneously has large p(0 ) and p(1 ) . however we prove that p(0)+p(1 ) never exceeds 1 in any protocol and we derive further constraints on p(0 ) and p(1 ) in terms of n , the number of times that the computer is not run . in particular we show that any protocol with p(0)+p(1)=1-epsilon must have n tending to infinity as epsilon tends to 0 . these general results are illustrated with some explicit protocols for counterfactual computation . we show that"interaction - free"measurements can be regarded as counterfactual computations , and our results then imply that n must be large if the probability of interaction is to be close to zero . finally , we consider some ways in which our formulation of counterfactual computation can be generalised .
