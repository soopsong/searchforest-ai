any method for estimating the ensemble average of arbitrary operator ( observables or not , including the density matrix ) relates the quantity of interest to a complete set of observables , i.e. a quorum } . this corresponds to an expansion on an irreducible set of operators in the liouville space . we give two general characterizations of these sets . all the known unbiased reconstruction techniques , i.e. ` ` quantum tomographies ' ' , can be described in this framework . new operatorial resolutions are given that can be used to implement novel reconstruction schemes .
