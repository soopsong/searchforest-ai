given an entanglement measure $ e$ , the entanglement of a quantum channel is defined as the largest amount of entanglement $ e$ that can be generated from the channel , if the sender and receiver are not allowed to share a quantum state before using the channel . the amortized entanglement of a quantum channel is defined as the largest net amount of entanglement $ e$ that can be generated from the channel , if the sender and receiver are allowed to share an arbitrary state before using the channel . our main technical result is that amortization does not enhance the entanglement of an arbitrary quantum channel , when entanglement is quantified by the max - rains relative entropy . we prove this statement by employing semi - definite programming ( sdp ) duality and sdp formulations for the max - rains relative entropy and a channel 's max - rains information , found recently in [ wang et al . , arxiv:1709.00200 ] . the main application of our result is a single - letter , strong - converse , and efficiently computable upper bound on the capacity of a quantum channel for transmitting qubits when assisted by positive - partial - transpose preserving ( ppt - p ) channels between every use of the channel . as the class of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) is contained in ppt - p , our result establishes a benchmark for the locc - assisted quantum capacity of an arbitrary quantum channel , which is relevant in the context of distributed quantum computation and quantum key distribution .
