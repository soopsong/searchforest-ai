the limited connectivity of current and next - generation quantum annealers motivates the need for efficient graph - minor embedding methods . these methods allow non - native problems to be adapted to the target annealer 's architecture . the overhead of the widely used heuristic techniques is quickly proving to be a significant bottleneck for solving real - world applications . to alleviate this difficulty , we propose a systematic and deterministic embedding method , exploiting the structures of both the input graph of the specific problem and the quantum annealer . we focus on the specific case of the cartesian product of two complete graphs , a regular structure that occurs in many problems . we divide the embedding problem by first embedding one of the factors of the cartesian product in a repeatable pattern . the resulting simplified problem consists of the placement and connecting together of these copies to reach a valid solution . aside from the obvious advantage of a systematic and deterministic approach with respect to speed and efficiency , the embeddings produced are easily scaled for larger processors and show desirable properties for the number of qubits used and the chain length distribution . to conclude , we briefly address the problem of circumventing inoperable qubits by presenting possible extensions of the method .
