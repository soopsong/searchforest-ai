the robust generation of quantum states in the presence of decoherence is a primary challenge for explorations of quantum mechanics at larger scales . using the mechanical motion of a single trapped ion , we utilize reservoir engineering to generate squeezed , coherent and displaced - squeezed states as steady states in the presence of noise . we verify the created state by generating two - state correlated spin - motion rabi oscillations resulting in high contrast measurements . for both cooling and measurement , we use spin - oscillator couplings that provide transitions between oscillator states in an engineered fock state basis . our approach should facilitate studies of entanglement , quantum computation , and open - system quantum simulations in a wide range of physical systems .
