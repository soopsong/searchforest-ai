we introduce a new model of interacting spin 1/2 . it describes interaction of three nearest neighbors . the hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of fredkin gates . the fredkin gate ( also known as the cswap gate ) is a computational circuit suitable for reversible computing . our construction generalizes the work of ramis movassagh and peter shor . our model can be solved by means of catalan combinatorics in the form of random walks on the upper half of a square lattice [ dyck walks ] . each dyck path can be mapped to a wave function of the spins . the ground state is an equally weighted superposition of dyck walks [ instead of motzkin walks ] . we can also express it as a matrix product state . we further construct the model of interacting spins 3/2 and greater half - integer spins . the models with higher spins require coloring of dyck walks . we construct su(k ) symmetric model [ here k is the number of colors ] . the leading term of the entanglement entropy is then proportional to the square root of the length of the lattice [ like in shor - movassagh model ] . the gap closes as a high power of the length of the lattice .
