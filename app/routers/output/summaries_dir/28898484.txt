recently , a non - gaussian field , which may be a useful basis for entanglement distillation and efficient quantum teleportation , has been experimentally produced by subtracting a photon from a squeezed gaussian field . we investigate the nonclassicality of such the field using negativity in the wigner function and the existence of positive well - defined $ p$ function . we obtain the condition to see negativity in the wigner function for the case including the mixed gaussian incoming field , the threshold photodetection and the inefficient homodyne measurement . we show how similar the photon - subtracted state is to a superposition of coherent states .
