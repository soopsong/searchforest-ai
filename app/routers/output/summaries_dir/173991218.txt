the enhancement of quantum heat engines ( qhes ) efficiency is of great interest for fundamental studies and quantum technology developments , where collective many - body effects play an important role . in this work we analyze the efficiency of two qhes where the working substance exhibits second order quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) . one of these engines is defined by the working substance corresponding to the anisotropic lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model and the other to the full dicke model . we consider that , working at thermal equilibrium , the heat engines realize a thermodynamic stirling cycle type . for both qhes , a remarkable enhancement of efficiency is obtained when during the cycle the working substances undergo a qpt , where eventually the efficiency reaches the carnot bound . we also analyze the effect of the degree of anisotropy in the interaction term of the lmg model and the unbalance between rotating and counter - rotating terms in the full dicke model . it is observed a better efficiency increase when the interaction term in the lmg model is more anisotropic , and in the full dicke model , when the rotating and counter - rotating interaction terms are equally balanced . these behaviors are related to the symmetries of the models . finally , we discuss an equivalence between our stirling cycle and the carnot cycle at some particular values of the model parameters , where the maximum efficiency is attained .
