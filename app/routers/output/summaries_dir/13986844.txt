this paper uses a system theoretic approach to show that classical linear time invariant controllers can not generate steady state entanglement in a bipartite gaussian quantum system which is initialized in a gaussian state . the paper also shows that the use of classical linear controllers can not generate entanglement in a finite time from a bipartite system initialized in a separable gaussian state . the approach reveals connections between system theoretic concepts and the well known physical principle that local operations and classical communications can not generate entangled states starting from separable states .
