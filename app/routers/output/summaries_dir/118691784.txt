entanglement negativity is a measure of mixed - state entanglement increasingly used to investigate and characterize emerging quantum many - body phenomena , including quantum criticality and topological order . we present two results for the entanglement negativity : a disentangling theorem , which allows the use of this entanglement measure as a means to detect whether a wave - function of three subsystems $ a$ , $ b$ , and $ c$ factorizes into a product state for parts $ ab_1 $ and $ b_2c$ ; and a monogamy relation , which states that if $ a$ is very entangled with $ b$ , then $ a$ can not be simultaneaously very entangled also with $ c$.
