inducing nonreciprocal wave propagation is a fundamental challenge across a wide range of physical systems in electromagnetics , optics , and acoustics . recent efforts to create nonreciprocal devices have departed from established magneto - optic methods and instead exploited momentum based techniques such as coherent spatiotemporal modulation of resonators and waveguides . however , to date the nonreciprocal frequency responses that such devices can achieve have been limited , mainly to either broadband or lorentzian - shaped transfer functions . here we show that nonreciprocal coupling between waveguides and resonator networks enables the creation of devices with customizable nonreciprocal frequency responses . we create nonreciprocal coupling through the action of synthetic phonons , which emulate propagating phonons and can scatter light between guided and resonant modes that differ in both frequency and momentum . we implement nonreciprocal coupling in microstrip circuits and experimentally demonstrate both elementary nonreciprocal functions such as isolation and gyration as well as reconfigurable , higher - order nonreciprocal filters . our results suggest nonreciprocal coupling as platform for a broad class of customizable nonreciprocal systems , adaptable to all wave phenomena .
