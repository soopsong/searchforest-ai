we show that single - mode nonclassicality of the output of an optomechanical cavity and the noncausal linear optical response of this cavity emerge at the same critical cavity - mechanical coupling . in other words , single - mode nonclassicality emerges when the barrier ( in electromagnetism ) avoiding faster - than - light communication is lifted off . the nature of the emergence of noncausal behavior does not depend on the length ( boundary conditions ) and the type of the cavity . origin of the noncausal behavior is the temporal / frequency relations between the incident and reflected waves at the outer surface of the cavity . we further discuss the relations with the recent studies ; ( i ) equivalence of the entanglement among identical particles to the nonclassicality of their quasiparticle excitations , ( ii ) necessity of superfluid behavior of vacuum , and ( iii ) entanglement - wormhole equivalence .
