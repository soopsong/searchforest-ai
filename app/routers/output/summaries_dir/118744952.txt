we study the security of two - way quantum cryptography at different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum , from the optical range down to the microwave range . in particular , we consider a two - way quantum communication protocol where gaussian - modulated thermal states are subject to random gaussian displacements and finally homodyned . we show how its security threshold ( in reverse reconciliation ) is extremely robust with respect to the preparation noise and able to outperform the security thresholds of one - way protocols at any wavelength . as a result , improved security distances are now accessible for implementing quantum key distribution at the very challenging regime of infrared frequencies .
