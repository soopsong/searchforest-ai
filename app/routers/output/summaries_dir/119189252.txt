hybrid interfaces between distinct quantum systems play a major role in the implementation of quantum networks . quantum states have to be stored in memories to synchronize the photon arrival times for entanglement swapping by projective measurements in quantum repeaters or for entanglement purification . here , we analyze the distortion of a single photon wave packet propagating through a dispersive and absorptive medium with high spectral resolution . single photons are generated from a single in(ga)as quantum dot with its excitonic transition precisely set relative to the cesium d1 transition . the delay of spectral components of the single photon wave packet with almost fourier - limited width is investigated in detail with a 200 mhz narrow - band monolithic fabry - p\'erot resonator . reflecting the excited state hyperfine structure of cesium,"slow light"and"fast light"behavior is observed . as a step towards room - temperature alkali vapor memories , quantum dot photons are delayed for 5 ns by strong dispersion between the two 1.17 ghz hyperfine - split excited state transitions . based on optical pumping on the hyperfine - split ground states , we propose a simple , all - optically controllable delay for synchronization of heralded narrow - band photons in a quantum network .
