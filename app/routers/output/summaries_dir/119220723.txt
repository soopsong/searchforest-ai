we study quantum walks of many non - interacting particles on a beam splitter array , as a paradigmatic testing ground for the competition of single- and many - particle interference in a multi - mode system . we derive a general expression for multi - mode particle - number correlation functions , valid for bosons and fermions , and infer pronounced signatures of many - particle interferences in the counting statistics .
