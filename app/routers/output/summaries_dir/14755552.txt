we demonstrate a method for efficient coupling of guided light from a single mode optical fiber to nanophotonic devices . our approach makes use of single - sided conical tapered optical fibers that are evanescently coupled over the last ~10 um to a nanophotonic waveguide . by means of adiabatic mode transfer using a properly chosen taper , single - mode fiber - waveguide coupling efficiencies as high as 97(1)% are achieved . efficient coupling is obtained for a wide range of device geometries which are either singly - clamped on a chip or attached to the fiber , demonstrating a promising approach for integrated nanophotonic circuits , quantum optical and nanoscale sensing applications .
