recently , quantum error - correcting codes were proposed that capitalize on the fact that many physical error models lead to a significant asymmetry between the probabilities for bit flip and phase flip errors . an example for a channel which exhibits such asymmetry is the combined amplitude damping and dephasing channel , where the probabilities of bit flips and phase flips can be related to relaxation and dephasing time , respectively . we give systematic constructions of asymmetric quantum stabilizer codes that exploit this asymmetry . our approach is based on a css construction that combines bch and finite geometry ldpc codes .
