understanding the non - markovian mechanisms underlying the revivals of quantum entanglement in the presence of classical environments is central in the theory of quantum information . tentative interpretations have been given by either the role of the environment as a control device or the concept of hidden entanglement . we address this issue from an information - theoretic point of view . to this aim , we consider a paradigmatic tripartite system , already realized in the laboratory , made of two independent qubits and a random classical field locally interacting with one qubit alone . we study the dynamical relationship between the two - qubit entanglement and the genuine tripartite correlations of the overall system , finding that collapse and revivals of entanglement correspond , respectively , to raise and fall of the overall tripartite correlations . interestingly , entanglement dark periods can enable plateaux of nonzero tripartite correlations . we then explain this behavior in terms of information flows among the different parties of the system . besides showcasing the phenomenon of the freezing of overall correlations , our results provide new insights on the origin of retrieval of entanglement within a hybrid quantum - classical system .
