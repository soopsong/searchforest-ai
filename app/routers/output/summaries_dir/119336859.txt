in a recent paper [ i.i . arkhipov , phys . rev . a 98 , 021803 ( 2018 ) ] , it was shown that one can completely identify the nonclassicality of single- and two - mode gaussian states by means of certain nonclassicality witnesses which are based on intensity moments up to the third order of optical fields , provided that an appropriate coherent displacement is applied to a given gaussian state . here , we utilize a mathematical equivalence between the description of the coherent displaced gaussian states generated in the spontaneous parametric processes and the gaussian states generated in the corresponding stimulated parametric processes . resorting to that equivalence , we study and compare the power of those nonclassicality witnesses in the detection of the nonclassicality of the two - mode gaussian states generated in both the spontaneous and stimulated second subharmonic and down - conversion processes and which are subsequently subject to a beam splitter . we demonstrate that by means of an appropriate induced stimulated emission one can completely identify the nonclassicality of the considered gaussian states in comparison to the case of the spontaneous emission . this is important from the experimental point of view , as the stimulated emission can be easily implemented in running optical experiments , and such method can exploit just simple linear detectors .
