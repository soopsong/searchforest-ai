we study the quantum measurement of a cantilever using a parametrically - coupled electromagnetic cavity which is driven at the two sidebands corresponding to the mechanical motion . this scheme , originally due to braginsky et al . [ v. braginsky , y. i. vorontsov , and k. p. thorne , science 209 , 547 ( 1980 ) ] , allows a back - action free measurement of one quadrature of the cantilever 's motion , and hence the possibility of generating a squeezed state . we present a complete quantum theory of this system , and derive simple conditions on when the quantum limit on the added noise can be surpassed . we also study the conditional dynamics of the measurement , and discuss how such a scheme ( when coupled with feedback ) can be used to generate and detect squeezed states of the oscillator . our results are relevant to experiments in optomechanics , and to experiments in quantum electromechanics employing stripline resonators coupled to mechanical resonators .
