we address the microscopic derivation of a quantum master equation in lindblad form for the dynamics of a massive test particle with internal degrees of freedom interacting through collisions with a background ideal gas . when either internal or centre of mass degrees of freedom can be treated classically , previously established equations are obtained as special cases . if in an interferometric setup the internal degrees of freedom are not detected at the output , the equation can be recast in the form of a generalized lindblad structure , which describes non - markovian effects . the effect of internal degrees of freedom on centre of mass decoherence is considered in this framework .
