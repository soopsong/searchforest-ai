repulsive and attractive interactions usually lead to very different physics . striking exceptions exist in the dynamics of driven - dissipative quantum systems . for the example of a photonic bose - hubbard dimer , we establish a one - to - one mapping relating the cases of onsite repulsion and attraction . we prove that the mapping is valid for an entire class of markovian open quantum systems with time - reversal invariant hamiltonian and physically meaningful inverse - sign hamiltonian . to underline the broad applicability of the mapping , we illustrate the one - to - one correspondence between the nonequilibrium dynamics in a geometrically frustrated spin lattice and that in a non - frustrated partner lattice .
