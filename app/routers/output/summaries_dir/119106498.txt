we demonstrate a doppler cooling and detection scheme for ions with low - lying d levels which almost entirely suppresses scattered laser light background , while retaining a high fluorescence signal and efficient cooling . we cool a single ion with a laser on the 2s1/2 to 2p1/2 transition as usual , but repump via the 2p3/2 level . by filtering out light on the cooling transition and detecting only the fluorescence from the 2p_3/2 to 2s1/2 decays , we suppress the scattered laser light background count rate to 1 per second while maintaining a signal of 29000 per second with moderate saturation of the cooling transition . this scheme will be particularly useful for experiments where ions are trapped in close proximity to surfaces , such as the trap electrodes in microfabricated ion traps , which leads to high background scatter from the cooling beam .
