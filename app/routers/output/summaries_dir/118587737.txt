we analyze the entanglement distribution and the two - qubit residual entanglement in multipartite systems . for a composite system consisting of two cavities interacting with independent reservoirs , it is revealed that the entanglement evolution is restricted by an entanglement monogamy relation derived here . moreover , it is found that the initial cavity - cavity entanglement evolves completely to the genuine four - partite cavities - reservoirs entanglement in the time interval between the sudden death of cavity - cavity entanglement and the birth of reservoir - reservoir entanglement . in addition , we also address the relationship between the genuine block - block entanglement form and qubit - block form in the interval .
