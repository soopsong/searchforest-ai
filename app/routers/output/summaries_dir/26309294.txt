as they can travel long distances , free space optical quantum states are good candidates for carrying information in quantum information technology protocols . these states , however , are often complex to produce and require protocols whose success probability drops quickly with an increase of the mean photon number . here we propose a new protocol for the generation and growth of arbitrary states , based on one by one coherent adjunctions of the simple state superposition $ \alpha | 0>+\beta | 1>$. due to the nature of the protocol , that allows for the use of quantum memories , it can outperform existing protocols .
