we consider dynamically generated spin squeezing in interacting bimodal condensates . we show that particle losses and non - zero temperature effects in a multimode theory completely change the scaling of the best squeezing for large atom numbers . we present the new scalings and we give approximate analytical expressions for the squeezing in the thermodynamic limit . besides reviewing our recent theoretical results , we give here a simple physical picture of how decoherence acts to limit the squeezing . we show in particular that under certain conditions the decoherence due to losses and non - zero temperatureacts as a simple dephasing .
