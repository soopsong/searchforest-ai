in recent years , superconducting qubits show great potential in quantum computation . hence , microwave photons become very interesting qubits for quantum information processing assisted by superconducting quantum computation . here , we present the first protocol for the entanglement concentration on microwave photons , resorting to the cross - kerr effect in circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . two superconducting transmission line resonators ( tlrs ) coupled to superconducting molecule with the n - type level structure induce the effective cross - kerr effect for realizing the quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement on microwave photons . with this device , we present a two - qubit polarization parity qnd detector on the photon states of the superconducting tlrs , which can be used to concentrate efficiently the nonlocal non - maximally entangled states of microwave photons assisted by several linear microwave elements . this protocol has a high efficiency and it may be useful for solid - state quantum information processing assisted by microwave photons .
