a quantum algorithm to solve the parity problem is better than its most efficient classical counter- part with a separation that is polynomial in the number of queries . this was shown by e. bernstein and u. vazirani and was one of the earliest indications that the quantum information processing can outperform the classical one by a significant margin . the problem and its solution both is usually stated for a 2-level system since we generally work with bits / qubits . however , many works have been done generalizing known quantum computing techniques to higher level systems . following this , we look at a generalization of the bernstein - vazirani algorithm implemented on a general qudit system .
