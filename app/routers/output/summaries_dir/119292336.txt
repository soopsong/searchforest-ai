we investigate an integrated optical circuit on lithium niobate designed to implement the teleportation - based quantum relay scheme for one - way quantum communication at a telecom wavelength . such an advanced quantum circuit merges for the first time , both optical - optical and electro - optical non - linear functions necessary to implement the desired on - chip single qubit teleportation . on one hand , spontaneous parametric down - conversion is used to produce entangled photon - pairs . on the other hand , we take advantage of two photon routers , consisting of electro - optically controllable couplers , to separate the paired photons and to perform a bell state measurement , respectively . after having validated all the individual functions in the classical regime , we have performed a hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) experiment to mimic a one - way quantum communication link . such a quantum effect , seen as a prerequisite towards achieving teleportation , has been obtained , at one of the routers , when the chip was coupled to an external single photon source . the two - photon interference pattern shows a net visibility of 80 % , which validates the proof of principle of a"quantum relay circuit"for qubits carried by telecom photons . in case of optimized losses , such a chip could increase the maximal achievable distance of one - way quantum key distribution links by a factor 1.8 . our approach and results emphasize the high potential of integrated optics on lithium niobate as a key technology for future reconfigurable quantum information manipulation .
