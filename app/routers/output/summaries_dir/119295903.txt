we propose a realization of a quantum heat engine in a hybrid microwave - optomechanical system that is the analog of a classical straight - twin engine . it exploits a pair of polariton modes that operate as out - of - phase quantum otto cycles . a third polariton mode that is essential in the coupling of the optical and microwave fields is maintained in a quasi - dark mode to suppress disturbances from the mechanical noise . we also find that the fluctuations in the contributions to the total work from the two polariton modes are characterized by quantum correlations that generally lead to a reduction in the extractable work compared to its classical version .
