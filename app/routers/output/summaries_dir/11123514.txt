quantum coherence is the most fundamental feature of quantum mechanics . the usual understanding of it depends on the choice of the basis , that is , the coherence of the same quantum state is different within different reference framework . to reveal all the potential coherence , we present the total quantum coherence measures in terms of two different methods . one is optimizing maximal basis - dependent coherence with all potential bases considered and the other is quantifying the distance between the state and the incoherent state set . interestingly , the coherence measures based on relative entropy and $ l_2 $ norm have the same form in the two different methods . in particular , we show that the measures based on the non - contractive $ l_2 $ norm is also a good measure different from the basis - dependent coherence . in addition , we show that all the measures are analytically calculable and have all the good properties . the experimental schemes for the detection of these coherence measures are also proposed by multiple copies of quantum states instead of reconstructing the full density matrix . by studying one type of quantum probing schemes , we find that both the normalized trace in the scheme of deterministic quantum computation with one qubit ( dqc1 ) and the overlap of two states in quantum overlap measurement schemes ( qom ) can be well described by the change of total coherence of the probing qubit . hence the nontrivial probing always leads to the change of the total coherence .
