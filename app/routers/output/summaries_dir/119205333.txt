many protocols and experiments in quantum information science are described in terms of simple measurements on qubits . however , in a real implementation , the exact description is more difficult , and more complicated observables are used . the question arises whether a claim of entanglement in the simplified description still holds , if the difference between the realistic and simplified models is taken into account . we show that a positive entanglement statement remains valid if a certain positive linear map connecting the two descriptions -- a so - called squashing operation -- exists ; then lower bounds on the amount of entanglement are also possible . we apply our results to polarization measurements of photons using only threshold detectors , and derive procedures under which multi - photon events can be neglected .
