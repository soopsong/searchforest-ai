we report a detailed study of the noise properties of a visible - to - telecom photon frequency converter based on difference frequency generation ( dfg ) . the device converts 580 nm photons to 1541 nm using a strong pump laser at 930 nm , in a periodically poled lithium niobate ridge waveguide . the converter reaches a maximum device efficiency of 46 % ( internal efficiency of 67 % ) at a pump power of 250 mw . the noise produced by the pump laser is investigated in detail by recording the noise spectra both in the telecom and visible regimes , and measuring the power dependence of the noise rates . the noise spectrum in the telecom is very broadband , as expected from previous work on similar dfg converters . however , we also observe several narrow dips in the telecom spectrum , with corresponding peaks appearing in the 580 nm noise spectrum . these features are explained by sum frequency generation of the telecom noise at wavelengths given by the phase matching condition of different spatial modes in the waveguide . the proposed noise model is in good agreement with all the measured data , including the power - dependence of the noise rates , both in the visible and telecom regime . these results are applicable to the class of dfg converters where the pump laser wavelength is in between the input and target wavelength .
