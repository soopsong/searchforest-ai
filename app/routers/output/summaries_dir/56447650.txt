while solid - state devices offer naturally reliable hardware for modern classical computers , thus far quantum information processors resemble vacuum tube computers in being neither reliable nor scalable . strongly correlated many body states stabilized in topologically ordered matter offer the possibility of naturally fault tolerant computing , but are both challenging to engineer and coherently control and can not be easily adapted to different physical platforms . we propose an architecture which achieves some of the robustness properties of topological models but with a drastically simpler construction . quantum information is stored in the symmetry - protected degenerate ground states of spin-1 chains , while quantum gates are performed by adiabatic non - abelian holonomies using only single - site fields and nearest - neighbor couplings . gate operations respect the symmetry , and so inherit some protection from noise and disorder from the symmetry - protected ground states .
