discrete - time quantum walks have been shown to simulate all known topological phases in one and two dimensions . being periodically driven quantum systems , their topological description , however , is more complex than that of closed hamiltonian systems . we map out the topological phases of the particle - hole symmetric one - dimensional discrete - time quantum walk . we find that there is no chiral symmetry in this system : its topology arises from the particle - hole symmetry alone . we calculate the z2 \times z2 topological invariant in a simple way that is consistent with a general definition for 1-dimensional periodically driven quantum systems . these results allow for a transparent interpretation of the edge states on a finite lattice via the the bulk - boundary correspondance . we find that the bulk floquet operator does not contain all the information needed for the topological invariant . as an illustration to this statement , we show that in the split - step quantum walk , the edges between two bulks with the same floquet operator can host topologically protected edge states .
