the global coupling of few - level quantum systems ( " spins " ) to a discrete set of bosonic modes is a key ingredient for many applications in quantum science , including large - scale entanglement generation , quantum simulation of the dynamics of long - range interacting spin models , and hybrid platforms for force and spin sensing . we present a general numerical framework for treating the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of such models based on matrix product states . our approach applies for generic spin - boson systems : it treats any spatial and operator dependence of the two - body spin - boson coupling and places no restrictions on relative energy scales . we show that the full counting statistics of collective spin measurements and infidelity of quantum simulation due to spin - boson entanglement , both of which are difficult to obtain by other techniques , are readily calculable in our approach . we benchmark our method using a recently developed exact solution for a particular spin - boson coupling relevant to trapped ion quantum simulators . finally , we show how decoherence can be incorporated within our framework using the method of quantum trajectories , and study the dynamics of an open - system spin - boson model with spatially non - uniform spin - boson coupling relevant for trapped atomic ion crystals in the presence of molecular ion impurities .
