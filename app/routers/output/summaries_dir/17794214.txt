optimization methods aimed at estimating the capacities of a general gaussian channel are developed . specifically evaluation of classical capacity as maximum of the holevo information is pursued over all possible gaussian encodings for the lossy bosonic channel , but extension to other capacities and other gaussian channels seems feasible . solutions for both memoryless and memory channels are presented . it is first dealt with single use ( single - mode ) channel where the capacity dependence from channel 's parameters is analyzed providing a full classification of the possible cases . then it is dealt with multiple uses ( multi - mode ) channel where the capacity dependence from the ( multi - mode ) environment state is analyzed when both total environment energy and environment purity are fixed . this allows a fair comparison among different environments , thus understanding the role of memory ( inter - mode correlations ) and phenomenon like superadditivity of the capacity . the developed methods are also used for deriving transmission rates with heterodyne and homodyne measurements at the channel output . classical capacity and transmission rates are presented within a unique framework where the rates can be treated as logarithmic approximations of the capacity .
