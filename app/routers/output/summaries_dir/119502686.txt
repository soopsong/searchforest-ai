this article is a short introduction to and review of the cluster - state model of quantum computation , in which coherent quantum information processing is accomplished via a sequence of single - qubit measurements applied to a fixed quantum state known as a cluster state . we also discuss a few novel properties of the model , including a proof that the cluster state can not occur as the exact ground state of any naturally occurring physical system , and a proof that measurements on any quantum state which is linearly prepared in one dimension can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer , and thus are not candidates for use as a substrate for quantum computation .
