we study the noncommutative corrections on the time - dependent aharonov - bohm effect when both the coordinate - coordinate and momentum - momentum noncommutativities are considered . this study is motivated by the recent observation that there is no net phase shift in the time - dependent ab effect on the ordinary space , and therefore tiny derivation from zero can indicate new physics . the vanishing of the time - dependent ab phase shift on the ordinary space is preserved by the gauge and lorentz symmetries . however , on the noncomutative phase space , while the ordinary gauge symmetry can be kept by the seiberg - witten map , but the lorentz symmetry is broken . therefore nontrivial noncommutative corrections are expected . we find there are three kinds of noncommutative corrections in general : 1 ) $ \xi$-dependent correction which comes from the noncommutativity among momentum operators ; 2 ) momentum - dependent correction which is rooted in the nonlocal interactions in the noncommutative extended model ; 3 ) momentum - independent correction which emerges become of the gauge invariant condition on the nonlocal interactions in the noncommutative model . we proposed two dimensionless quantities , which are based on the distributions of the measured phase shift with respect to the external magnetic field and to the cross section enclosed by the particle trajectory , to extract the noncommutative parameters . we find that stronger ( weaker ) magnetic field strength can give better bounds on the coordinate - coordinate ( momentum - momentum ) noncommutative parameter , and large parameter space region can be explored by the time - dependent ab effect .
