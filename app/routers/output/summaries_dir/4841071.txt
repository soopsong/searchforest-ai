we address the question as to whether an entangled state that satisfies local realism will give a violation of the same , after entanglement swapping in a suitable scenario . we consider such possibility as a kind of superadditivity in nonclassicality . importantly , it will indicate that checking for violation of local realism , in the state obtained after entanglement swapping , can be a method for detecting entanglement in the input state of the swapping procedure . we investigate various entanglement swapping schemes , which involve mixed initial states . the strength of violation of local realism by the state obtained after entanglement swapping , is compared with the one for the input states . we obtain a kind of superadditivity of violation of local realism for werner states , consequent upon entanglement swapping involving greenberger - horne - zeilinger state measurements . we also discuss whether entanglement swapping of specific states may be used in quantum repeaters with a substantially reduced need to perform the entanglement distillation step .
