we theoretically investigate a driven - dissipative model of strongly interacting photons in a nonlinear optical cavity in the presence of a synthetic magnetic field . we show the possibility of using a frequency - dependent incoherent pump to create a strongly - correlated $ \nu = 1/2 $ bosonic laughlin state of light : thanks to the incompressibility of the laughlin state , fluctuations in the total particle number and excitation of edge modes can be tamed by imposing a suitable external potential profile for photons . we further propose angular momentum - selective spectroscopy of the emitted light as a tool to obtain unambiguous signatures of the microscopic physics of the quantum hall liquid of light .
