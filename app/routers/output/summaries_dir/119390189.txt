quantum frequency combs from chip - scale integrated sources are promising candidates for scalable and robust quantum information processing ( qip ) . however , to use these quantum combs for frequency domain qip , demonstration of entanglement in the frequency basis , showing that the entangled photons are in a coherent superposition of multiple frequency bins , is required . we present a verification of qubit and qutrit frequency - bin entanglement using an on - chip quantum frequency comb with 40 mode pairs , through a two - photon interference measurement that is based on electro - optic phase modulation . our demonstrations provide an important contribution in establishing integrated optical microresonators as a source for high - dimensional frequency - bin encoded quantum computing , as well as dense quantum key distribution .
