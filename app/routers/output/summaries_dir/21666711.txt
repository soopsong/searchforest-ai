measuring the power spectral density of a stochastic process , such as a stochastic force or magnetic field , is a fundamental task in many sensing applications . quantum noise is becoming a major limiting factor to such a task in future technology , especially in optomechanics for temperature , stochastic gravitational wave , and decoherence measurements . motivated by this concern , here we prove a measurement - independent quantum limit to the accuracy of estimating the spectrum parameters of a classical stochastic process coupled to a quantum dynamical system . we demonstrate our results by analyzing the data from a continuous optical phase estimation experiment and showing that the experimental performance with homodyne detection is close to the quantum limit . we further propose a spectral photon counting method that can attain quantum - optimal performance for weak modulation and a coherent - state input , with an error scaling superior to that of homodyne detection at low signal - to - noise ratios .
