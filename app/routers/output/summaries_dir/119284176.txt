weak cross - kerr nonlinearities between single photons and coherent states are the basis for many applications in quantum information processing . these nonlinearities have so far mainly been discussed in terms of highly idealized single - mode models . we develop a general theory of the interaction between continuous - mode photonic pulses and apply it to the case of a single photon interacting with a coherent state . we quantitatively study the validity of the usual single - mode approximation using the concepts of fidelity and conditional phase . we show that high fidelities , non - zero conditional phases and high photon numbers are compatible , under conditions where the pulses fully pass through each other and where unwanted transverse - mode effects are suppressed .
