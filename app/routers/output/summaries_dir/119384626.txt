we present a simple protocol for certifying graph states in quantum networks using stabiliser measurements . the certification statements can easily be applied to different protocols using graph states . we see for example how it can be used to for measurement based verified quantum compu- tation , certified sampling of random unitaries and quantum metrology and sharing quantum secrets over untrusted channels .
