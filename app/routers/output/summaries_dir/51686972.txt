we propose a scheme to enhance the fidelity of symmetric quantum cloning machine using a weak measurement . by adjusting the intensity of weak measurement parameter $ p$ , we obtain the copies with different optimal fidelity . choosing proper value of $ p$ , we can obtain the perfect copies for initial qubits . in this paper , we focus on $ 1 - 2 $ quantum cloning for two nonorthogonal states . sets containing more than two linear independent states are also discussed briefly . due to weak measurements being probabilistic , we obtain high fidelity at risk of probability . if the weak measurement successes , we do the following operations to obtain copies with high fidelity , otherwise , the cloning process fails and we need do nothing . from this perspective , the scheme we propose is economical for saving quantum resource and time , which may be very useful in quantum information processing .
