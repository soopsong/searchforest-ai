since the early nineties , it has been observed that the schroedinger bridge problem can be formulated as a stochastic control problem with atypical boundary constraints . this in turn has a fluid dynamic counterpart where the flow of probability densities represents an entropic interpolation between the given initial and final marginals . in the zero noise limit , such entropic interpolation converges in a suitable sense to the displacement interpolation of optimal mass transport ( omt ) . we consider two absolutely continuous curves in wasserstein space $ { \cal w}_2 $ and study the evolution of the relative entropy on $ { \cal w}_2\times { \cal w}_2 $ on a finite time interval . thus , this study differs from previous work in omt theory concerning relative entropy from a fixed ( often equilibrium ) distribution ( density ) . we derive a gradient flow on wasserstein product space . we find the remarkable property that fluxes in the two components are opposite . plugging in the"steepest descent"into the evolution of the relative entropy we get what appears to be a new formula : the two flows approach each other at a faster rate than that of two solutions of the same fokker - planck . we then study the evolution of relative entropy in the case of uncontrolled - controlled diffusions . in two special cases of the schroedinger bridge problem , we show that such relative entropy may be monotonically decreasing or monotonically increasing .
