a discrete - time method for solving problems in optimal quantum control is presented . controlling the time discretized markovian dynamics of a quantum system can be reduced to a markov - decision process . we demonstrate this method in this with a class of simple one qubit systems , which are also discretized in space . for the task of state preparation we solve the examples both numerically and analytically with dynamic programming techniques .
