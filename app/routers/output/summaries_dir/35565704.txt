in d - dimensional lattices of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators , we analyze the heat current caused by two thermal baths of different temperature , which are coupled to opposite ends of the lattice , with focus on the validity of fourier 's law of heat conduction . we provide analytical solutions of the heat current through the quantum system in the non - equilibrium steady state using the rotating - wave approximation and bath interactions described by a master equation of lindblad form . the influence of local dephasing in the transition of ballistic to diffusive transport is investigated .
