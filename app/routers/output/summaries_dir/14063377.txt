the non - gaussian operations effected by adding or subtracting a photon on the entangled optical beams emerging from a parametric down - conversion process have been suggested to enhance entanglement . heralded photon addition or subtraction is , as a matter of fact , at the heart of continuous - variable entanglement distillation . the use of such processes has recently been experimentally demonstrated in the context of the generation of optical coherent - state superpositions or the verification of the canonical commutation relations . here , we carry out a systematic study of the effect of local photon additions or subtractions on a two - mode squeezed vacuum state , showing that the entanglement generally increases with the number of such operations . this is analytically proven when additions or subtractions are restricted to one mode only , while we observe that the highest entanglement is achieved when these operations are equally shared between the two modes . we also note that adding photons typically provides a stronger entanglement enhancement than subtracting photons , while photon subtraction performs better in terms of energy efficiency . furthermore , we analyze the interplay between entanglement and non - gaussianity , showing that it is more subtle than previously expected .
