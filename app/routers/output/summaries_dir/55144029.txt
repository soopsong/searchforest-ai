the application of postselection to a weak quantum measurement leads to the phenomenon of weak values . expressed in units of the measurement strength , the displacement of a quantum coherent measuring device is ordinarily bounded by the eigenspectrum of the measured observable . postselection can enable an interference effect that moves the average displacement far outside this range , bringing practical benefits in certain situations . employing the fisher information metric , we argue that the amplified displacement offers no fundamental metrological advantage , due to the necessarily reduced probability of success . our understanding of metrological advantage is the possibility of a lower uncertainty in the estimate of an unknown parameter with a large number of trials . we analyze a situation in which the detector is pixelated with a finite resolution , and in which the detector is afflicted by random displacements : imperfections which degrade the fundamental limits of parameter estimation . surprisingly , weak - value amplification is no more robust to them than a technique making no use of the amplification effect brought about by a final , postselected measurement .
