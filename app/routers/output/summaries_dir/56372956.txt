we demonstrate the tunable enhancement of the zero phonon line of a single nitrogen - vacancy color center in diamond at cryogenic temperature . an open cavity fabricated using focused ion beam milling provides mode volumes as small as 1.24 $ \mu$m$^3$. in - situ tuning of the cavity resonance is achieved with piezoelectric actuators . at optimal coupling of the full open cavity the signal from individual zero phonon line transitions is enhanced by about a factor of 10 and the overall emission rate of the nv$^-$ center is increased by 40 % compared with that measured from the same center in the absence of cavity field confinement . this result is important for the realization of efficient spin - photon interfaces and scalable quantum computing using optically addressable solid state spin qubits .
