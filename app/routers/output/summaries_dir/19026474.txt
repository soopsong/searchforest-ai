the problem of optimally estimating an unknown unitary quantum operation with the aid of entanglement is addressed . the idea is to prepare an entangled pair , apply the unknown unitary to one of the two parts and then measure the joint output state . this measurement could be an entangled one or it could be separable ( e.g. , locc ) . a comparison is made between these possibilities and it is shown that by using non - separable measurements one can improve the accuracy of the estimation by a factor of $ 2(d+1)/d$ where $ d$ is the dimension of the hilbert space on which $ u$ acts .
