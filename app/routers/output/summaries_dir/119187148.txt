in this paper , results of quantum calculations are presented for feedback cooling of an optically trapped nanoparticle in the laser - shot - noise - dominant regime . we numerically investigate the system using both parametric and force feedback cooling schemes . for the same measurement efficiency , the cooling limit from the force feedback is lower than that from the parametric feedback . we also develop a set of semi - classical equations for feedback cooling that accurately match the quantum results . it is demonstrated , by rescaling the semi - classical equations , that the cooling dynamics is uniquely determined by the parameter set : the feedback strength , the measurement efficiency and the change of occupation number over one oscillation period due to the shot noise . the minimum occupation number is determined by the measurement efficiency and the change of occupation number over one period .
