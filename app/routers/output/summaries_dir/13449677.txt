in this paper , an efficient arbitrated quantum signature scheme is proposed by combining quantum cryptographic techniques and some ideas in classical cryptography . in the presented scheme , the signatory and the receiver can share a long - term secret key with the arbitrator by utilizing the key together with a random number . while in previous quantum signature schemes , the key shared between the signatory and the arbitrator or between the receiver and the arbitrator could be used only once , and thus each time when a signatory needs to sign , the signatory and the receiver have to obtain a new key shared with the arbitrator through a quantum key distribution protocol . detailed theoretical analysis shows that the proposed scheme is efficient and provably secure .
