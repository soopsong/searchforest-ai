we study the entanglement properties of a closed chain of harmonic oscillators that are coupled via a translationally invariant hamiltonian , where the coupling acts only on the position operators . we consider the ground state and thermal states of this system , which are gaussian states . the entanglement properties of these states can be completely characterized analytically when one uses the logarithmic negativity as a measure of entanglement .
