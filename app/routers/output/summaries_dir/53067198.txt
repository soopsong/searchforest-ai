we propose a time - delayed feedback control scheme for open quantum systems that can dramatically reduce the time to reach steady state . no measurement is performed in the feedback loop , and we suggest a simple all - optical implementation for a cavity qed system . we demonstrate the potential of the scheme by applying it to a driven and dissipative dicke model , as recently realized in a quantum gas experiment . the time to reach steady state can then reduced by two orders of magnitude for parameters taken from experiment , making previously inaccessible long time attractors reachable within typical experimental run times . the scheme also offers the possibility of slowing down the dynamics , as well as qualitatively changing the phase diagram of the corresponding physical system .
