we present a systematic method to introduce free parameters in sets of mutually unbiased bases . in particular , we demonstrate that any set of m real mutually unbiased bases in dimension n>2 admits the introduction of ( m-1)n/2 free parameters which can not be absorbed by a global unitary operation . as consequence , there are m = k+1 mutually unbiased bases in every dimension n = k^2 with k^3/2 free parameters , where k is even . we construct the maximal set of triplets of mutually unbiased bases for two - qubits systems and triplets , quadruplets and quintuplets of mutually unbiased bases with free parameters for three - qubits systems . furthermore , we study the richness of the entanglement structure of such bases and we provide the quantum circuits required to implement all these bases with free parameters in the laboratory . finally , we find the upper bound for the maximal number of real and complex mutually unbiased bases existing in every dimension . this proof is simple , short and it considers basic matrix algebra .
