quantum computing allows for the potential of significant advancements in both the speed and the capacity of widely used machine learning techniques . here we employ quantum algorithms for the hopfield network , which can be used for pattern recognition , reconstruction , and optimization as a realization of a content - addressable memory system . we show that an exponentially large network can be stored in a polynomial number of quantum bits by encoding the network into the amplitudes of quantum states . by introducing a classical technique for operating the hopfield network , we can leverage quantum algorithms to obtain a quantum computational complexity that is logarithmic in the dimension of the data . we also present an application of our method as a genetic sequence recognizer .
