the basic operating element of standard quantum computation is the qubit , an isolated two - level system that can be accurately controlled , initialized and measured . however , the majority of proposed physical architectures for quantum computation are built from systems that contain much more complicated hilbert space structures . hence , defining a qubit requires the identification of an appropriate controllable two - dimensional sub - system . this prompts the obvious question of how well a qubit , thus defined , is confined to this subspace , and whether we can experimentally quantify the potential leakage into to states outside the qubit subspace . in this paper we demonstrate that subspace leakage can be quantitatively characterized using minimal theoretical assumptions by examining the fourier spectrum of the rabi oscillation experiment .
