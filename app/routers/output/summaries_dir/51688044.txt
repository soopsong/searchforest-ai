the elastic scattering peak of a resonantly driven two - level system has been argued to provide narrow - linewidth antibunched photons . although independent measurements of spectral width on the one hand and antibunching on the other hand do seem to show that this is the case , a joint measurement reveals that only one or the other of these attributes can be realised in the direct emission . we discuss a scheme which interferes the emission with a laser to produce simultaneously single photons of subnatural linewidth . in particular , we consider the effect of dephasing and of the detuning between the driving laser and/or the detector with the emitter . we find that also in presence of dephasing , our scheme brings considerable improvement as compared to the standard scheme .
