we report on the state of the art of quantum walk experiments with neutral atoms in state - dependent optical lattices . we demonstrate a novel state - dependent transport technique enabling the control of two spin - selective sublattices in a fully independent fashion . this transport technique allowed us to carry out a test of single - particle quantum interference based on the violation of the leggett - garg inequality and , more recently , to probe two - particle quantum interference effects with neutral atoms cooled into the motional ground state . these experiments lay the groundwork for the study of discrete - time quantum walks of strongly interacting , indistinguishable particles to demonstrate quantum cellular automata of neutral atoms .
