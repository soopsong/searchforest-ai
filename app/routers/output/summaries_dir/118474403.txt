in spite of all of its successes , quantum mechanics leaves us with a central problem : how does nature create a"foot - bridge"from fragile quanta to the objective world of everyday experience ? here we identify within quantum mechanics a fundamental process leading to the perceived objectivity and called state information broadcasting . this is the trick that nature uses instead of a simple cloning . we uncover it basing on minimal assumptions , without referring to any dynamical details or a concrete model . more specifically , we show how a crucial for quantum mechanics notion of non - disturbance due to bohr and a natural definition of objectivity lead to a canonical structure of a quantum system - environment state , reflecting objective information records about the system stored in the environment .
