performance of cryptanalytic quantum search algorithms is mainly inferred from query complexity which hides overhead induced by an implementation . to shed light on quantitative complexity analysis removing hidden factors , we provide a framework for estimating time - space complexity , with carefully accounting for characteristics of target cryptographic functions . processor and circuit parallelization methods are taken into account , resulting in the time - space trade - offs curves in terms of depth and qubit . the method guides how to rank different circuit designs in order of their efficiency . the framework is applied to representative cryptosystems nist referred to as a guideline for security parameters , reassessing the security strengths of aes and sha-2 .
