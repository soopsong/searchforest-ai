we theoretically analyze the quantum noise of signal - recycled laser interferometric gravitational - wave detectors with additional input and output optics , namely frequency - dependent squeezing of the vacuum entering the dark port and frequency - dependent homodyne detection . we combine the work of buonanno and chen on the quantum noise of signal - recycled interferometers with ordinary input - output optics , and the work of kimble el al . on frequency - dependent input - output optics with conventional interferometers . analytical formulas for the optimal input and output frequency dependencies are obtained . it is shown that injecting squeezed light with the optimal frequency - dependent squeezing angle into the dark port yields an improvement on the noise spectral density by a factor of exp(-2r ) ( in power ) over the entire squeezing bandwidth , where r is the squeezing parameter . it is further shown that frequency - dependent ( variational ) homodyne read - out leads to an additional increase in sensitivity which is significant in the wings of the doubly resonant structure . the optimal variational input squeezing in case of an ordinary output homodyne detection is shown to be realizable by applying two optical filters on a frequency - independent squeezed vacuum . throughout this paper , we take as example the signal - recycled topology currently being completed at the geo600 site . however , theoretical results obtained here are also applicable to the proposed topology of advanced ligo .
