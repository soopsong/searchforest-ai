one of the essential features of quantum mechanics is that most pairs of observables can not be measured simultaneously . this phenomenon is most strongly manifested when observables are related to mutually unbiased bases . in this paper , we shed some light on the connection between mutually unbiased bases and another essential feature of quantum mechanics , quantum entanglement . it is shown that a complete set of mutually unbiased bases of a bipartite system contains a fixed amount of entanglement , independently of the choice of the set . this has implications for entanglement distribution among the states of a complete set . in prime - squared dimensions we present an explicit experiment - friendly construction of a complete set with a particularly simple entanglement distribution . finally , we describe basic properties of mutually unbiased bases composed only of product states . the constructions are illustrated with explicit examples in low dimensions . we believe that properties of entanglement in mutually unbiased bases might be one of the ingredients to be taken into account to settle the question of the existence of complete sets . we also expect that they will be relevant to applications of bases in the experimental realization of quantum protocols in higher - dimensional hilbert spaces .
