nonclassicality filters provide a universal method to visualize the nonclassicality of arbitrary quantum states of light through negativities of a regularized glauber - sudarshan $ p$ function , also denoted as nonclassicality quasiprobability . such filters are introduced and analyzed for optimizing the experimental certification of nonclassical effects . an analytic filter is constructed which preserves the full information on the quantum state . for balanced homodyne detection , the number of data points is analyzed to get the negativities of the nonclassicality quasiprobability with high statistical significance . the method is applied to different scenarios , such as phase randomized squeezed vacuum states , single - photon - added thermal states , and heralded state engineering with array detectors . the generalization to visualize quantum correlations of multimode radiation fields is also considered .
