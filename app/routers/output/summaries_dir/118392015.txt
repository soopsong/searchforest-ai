high - dimensional quantum entanglement is drawing attention because it enables us to perform quantum information tasks that are robust against noises . to test the nonlocality of entangled qudits , the collins - gisin - linden - massar - popescu ( cglmp ) inequality has been proposed and demonstrated using qudits based on orbital angular momentum , time - energy uncertainty , and frequency bins . here , we report the generation and observation of time - bin entangled ququarts . we implemented a measurement for the cglmp inequality test using cascaded delay mach - zehnder interferometers fabricated by using planar lightwave circuit technology , with which we achieved a precise and stable measurement for time - bin - entangled ququarts . in addition , we generated an optimized entangled state by modulating the pump pulse intensities , with which we can observe the theoretical maximum violation for the cglmp inequality test . as a result , we successfully observed a bell - type parameter $ s_4 = 2.774 \pm 0.025 $ violating the cglmp inequality for the maximally entangled state and an enhanced bell - type parameter $ s_4 = 2.913 \pm 0.023 $ for the optimized entangled state .
