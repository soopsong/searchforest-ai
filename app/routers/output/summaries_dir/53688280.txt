helium atoms in rydberg states have been manipulated coherently with microwave radiation pulses near a gold surface and near a superconducting nbtin surface at a temperature of $ 3 \text{k}$. the experiments were carried out with a skimmed supersonic beam of metastable $ ( 1\text{s})^1(2\text{s})^1\ , { } ^1\text{s}_0 $ helium atoms excited with laser radiation to $ n\text{p}$ rydberg levels with principal quantum number $ n$ between $ 30 $ and $ 40$. the separation between the cold surface and the center of the collimated beam is adjustable down to $ 250 \mu\text{m}$. short - lived $ n\text{p}$ rydberg levels were coherently transferred to the long - lived $ n\text{s}$ state to avoid radiative decay of the rydberg atoms between the photoexcitation region and the region above the cold surfaces . further coherent manipulation of the $ n\text{s}$ rydberg levels with pulsed microwave radiation above the surfaces enabled measurements of stray electric fields and allowed us to study the decoherence of the atomic ensemble . adsorption of residual gas onto the surfaces and the resulting slow build - up of stray fields was minimized by controlling the temperature of the surface and monitoring the partial pressures of h$_2$o , n$_2 $ , o$_2 $ and co$_2 $ in the experimental chamber during the cool - down . compensation of the stray electric fields to levels below $ 100 \text{mv}/\text{cm}$ was achieved over a region of $ 6 \text{mm}$ along the beam - propagation direction which , for the $ 1770 \text{m}/\text{s}$ beam velocity , implies the possibility to preserve the coherence of the atomic sample for several microseconds above the cold surfaces .
