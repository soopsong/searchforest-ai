optimizing a connection through a quantum repeater network requires careful attention to the photon propagation direction of the individual links , the arrangement of those links into a path , the error management mechanism chosen , and the application 's pattern of consuming the bell pairs generated . we analyze combinations of these parameters , concentrating on one - way error correction schemes ( 1-epp ) and high success probability links ( those averaging enough entanglement successes per round trip time interval to satisfy the error correction system ) . we divide the buffering time ( defined as minimizing the time during which qubits are stored without being usable ) into the link - level and path - level waits . with three basic link timing patterns , a path timing pattern with zero unnecessary path buffering exists for all $ 3^h$ combinations of $ h$ hops , for bell inequality violation experiments ( b class ) and clifford group ( c class ) computations , but not for full teleportation ( t class ) computations . on most paths , t class computations have a range of pareto optimal timing patterns with a non - zero amount of path buffering . they can have optimal zero path buffering only on a chain of links where the photonic quantum states propagate counter to the direction of teleportation . such a path reduces the time that a quantum state must be stored by a factor of two compared to pareto optimal timing on some other possible paths .
