we present a detailed numerical investigation of five nonlinear materials and their properties regarding photon - pair creation using parametric downconversion . periodic poling of ferroelectric nonlinear materials is a convenient way to generate collinearly propagating photon pairs . most applications and experiments use the well - known potassium titanyl phosphate ( ktiopo4 , ppktp ) and lithium niobate ( linbo3 , ppln ) crystals for this purpose . in this article we provide a profound discussion on the family of ktp - isomorphic nonlinear materials , including ktp itself but also the much less common cta ( cstioaso4 ) , kta ( ktioaso4 ) , rta ( rbtioaso4 ) and rtp ( rbtiopo4 ) . we discuss in which way these crystals can be used for creation of spectrally pure downconversion states and generation of crystal - intrinsic polarisation- and frequency entanglement . the investigation of the new materials disclosed a whole new range of promising experimental setups , in some cases even outperforming the established materials ppln and ppktp .
