with the overwhelming success in the field of quantum information in the last decades , the"quest"for a quantum neural network ( qnn ) model began in order to combine quantum computing with the striking properties of neural computing . this article presents a systematic approach to qnn research , which so far consists of a conglomeration of ideas and proposals . it outlines the challenge of combining the nonlinear , dissipative dynamics of neural computing and the linear , unitary dynamics of quantum computing . it establishes requirements for a meaningful qnn and reviews existing literature against these requirements . it is found that none of the proposals for a potential qnn model fully exploits both the advantages of quantum physics and computing in neural networks . an outlook on possible ways forward is given , emphasizing the idea of open quantum neural networks based on dissipative quantum computing .
