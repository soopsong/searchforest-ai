we present our experiments on refractometric sensing with ultrahigh - q , crystalline , birefringent magnesium fluoride ( mgf$_2 $ ) whispering gallery mode resonators . the difference to fused silica which is most commonly used for sensing experiments is the small refractive index of mgf$_2 $ which is very close to that of water . compared to fused silica this leads to more than 50 % longer evanescent fields and a 4.25 times larger sensitivity . moreover the birefringence amplifies the sensitivity difference between tm and te type modes which will enhance sensing experiments based on difference frequency measurements . we estimate the performance of our resonators and compare them with fused silica theoretically and present experimental data showing the interferometrically measured evanescent decay and the sensitivity of mm - sized mgf$_2 $ whispering gallery mode resonators immersed in water . they show reasonable agreement with the developed theory . furthermore , we observe stable q factors in water well above $ 1 \times 10 ^ 8$.
