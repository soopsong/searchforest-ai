we study two two - level atomic quantum systems ( qubits ) placed close to a body held at a temperature different from that of the surrounding walls . while at thermal equilibrium the two - qubit dynamics is characterized by not entangled steady thermal states , we show that absence of thermal equilibrium may bring to the generation of entangled steady states . remarkably , this entanglement emerges from the two - qubit dissipative dynamic itself , without any further external action on the two qubits , suggesting a new protocol to produce and protect entanglement which is intrinsically robust to environmental effects .
