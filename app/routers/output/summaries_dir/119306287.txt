we consider feedback cooling in a cavityless levitated optomechanics setup , and we investigate the possibility to improve the feedback implementation . we apply optimal control theory to derive the optimal feedback signal both for quadratic ( parametric ) and linear ( electric ) feedback . we numerically compare optimal feedback against the typical feedback implementation used for experiments . in order to do so , we implement a tracking scheme that takes into account the modulation of the laser intensity . we show that such a tracking implementation allows us to increase the feedback strength , leading to faster cooling rates and lower center - of - mass temperatures .
