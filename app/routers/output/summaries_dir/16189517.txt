we present three contributions to the understanding of qma with multiple provers : 1 ) we give a tight soundness analysis of the protocol of [ blier and tapp , icqnm ' 09 ] , yielding a soundness gap omega(1 / n^2 ) . our improvement is achieved without the use of an instance with a constant soundness gap ( i.e. , without using a pcp ) . 2 ) we give a tight soundness analysis of the protocol of [ chen and drucker , arxiv ' 10 ] , thereby improving their result from a monolithic protocol where theta(sqrt(n ) ) provers are needed in order to have any soundness gap , to a protocol with a smooth trade - off between the number of provers k and a soundness gap omega(k^2 / n ) , as long as k>=omega(log n ) . ( and , when k = theta(sqrt(n ) ) , we recover the original parameters of chen and drucker . ) 3 ) we make progress towards an open question of [ aaronson et al . , toc ' 09 ] about what kinds of np - complete problems are amenable to sublinear multiple - prover qma protocols , by observing that a large class of such examples can easily be derived from results already in the pcp literature - namely , at least the languages recognized by a non - deterministic rams in quasilinear time .
