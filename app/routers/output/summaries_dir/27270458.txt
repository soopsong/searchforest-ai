we realize tunable coupling between two superconducting transmission line resonators . the coupling is mediated by a non - hysteretic rf squid acting as a flux - tunable mutual inductance between the resonators . from the mode distance observed in spectroscopy experiments , we derive a coupling strength ranging between -320mhz and 37 mhz . in the case where the coupling strength is about zero , the microwave power cross transmission between the two resonators can be reduced by almost four orders of magnitude compared to the case where the coupling is switched on . in addition , we observe parametric amplification by applying a suitable additional drive tone .
