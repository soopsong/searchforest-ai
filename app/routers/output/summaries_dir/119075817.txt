an experimentally feasible scheme is proposed for rapidly generating two - atom three - dimensional ( 3d ) entanglement with one step . as one technique of shortcuts to adiabaticity , transitionless quantum driving is applied to speed up the adiabatic generation of two - atom 3d entanglement . apart from the rapid rate , the scheme has much higher experimental feasibility than the recent research ( quant . inf . process . doi : 10.1007 / s11128 - 016 - 1453 - 2 , 2016 ) . besides , numerical simulations indicate the scheme has strong robustness against parameter deviations and decoherence .
