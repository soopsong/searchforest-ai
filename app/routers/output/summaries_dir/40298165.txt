characterizing quantum systems through experimental data is critical to applications as diverse as metrology and quantum computing . analyzing this experimental data in a robust and reproducible manner is made challenging , however , by the lack of readily - available software for performing principled statistical analysis . we improve the robustness and reproducibility of characterization by introducing an open - source library , qinfer , to address this need . our library makes it easy to analyze data from tomography , randomized benchmarking , and hamiltonian learning experiments either in post - processing , or online as data is acquired . qinfer also provides functionality for predicting the performance of proposed experimental protocols from simulated runs . by delivering easy - to - use characterization tools based on principled statistical analysis , qinfer helps address many outstanding challenges facing quantum technology .
