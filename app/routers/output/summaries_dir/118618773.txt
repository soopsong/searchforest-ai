many experiments in quantum information aim at creating multi - partite entangled states . quantifying the amount of entanglement that was actually generated can , in principle , be accomplished using full - state tomography . this method requires the determination of a parameter set that is growing exponentially with the number of qubits and becomes infeasible even for moderate numbers of particles . non - trivial bounds on experimentally prepared entanglement can however be obtained from partial information on the density matrix . the fundamental question that needs to be addressed in this context is then formulated as : what is the entanglement content of the least entangled quantum state that is compatible with the available measurement data ? we formulate the problem mathematically employing methods from the theory of semi - definite programming and then address this problem for the case , where the goal of the experiment is the creation of graph states . the observables that we consider are the generators of the stabilizer group , thus the number of measurement settings grows only linearly in the number of qubits . we provide analytical solutions as well as numerical methods that may be applied directly to experiments , and compare the obtained bounds with results from full - state tomography for simulated data .
