we analyze the role of dimensionality in the time evolution of discrete time quantum walks through the example of the three - state walk on a two - dimensional , triangular lattice . we show that the three - state grover walk does not lead to trapping ( localization ) or recurrence to the origin , in sharp contrast to the grover walk on the two dimensional square lattice . we determine the power law scaling of the probability at the origin with the method of stationary phase . we prove that only a special subclass of coin operators can lead to recurrence and there are no coins leading to localization . the propagation for the recurrent subclass of coins is quasi one - dimensional .
