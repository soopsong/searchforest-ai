binary - outcome measurements allow to determine whether a multi - level quantum system is in a certain state while preserving quantum coherence between all orthogonal states . in this paper , we explore different regimes of the dispersive readout of a three - level superconducting quantum system coupled to a microwave cavity in order to implement binary - outcome measurements . by designing identical cavity frequency shifts for the first and second excited states of the system , we realize strong projective binary - outcome measurements onto its ground state with a fidelity of $ 94.3\%$. complemented with standard microwave control and low - noise parametric amplification , this scheme enables the quantum non - demolition detection of leakage errors and can be used to create sets of compatible measurements to reveal the contextual nature of superconducting circuits .
