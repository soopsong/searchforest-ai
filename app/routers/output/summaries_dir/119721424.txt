hilbert space fusion frames are a natural extension of hilbert space frames , extending the notion from a set of vectors in a hilbert space to a set of subspaces of a hilbert space with analogous notions of overcompleteness and boundedness . as tight frames are a very important topic within standard frame theory , tight fusion frames are similarly important ; however , only trivial examples of tight fusion frames are hitherto known . in this paper , we apply ideas from gabor analysis to demonstrate a non - trivial construction of tight fusion frames . we then use this construction to further show their applicability in some cases for the retrieval of signals modulo phase .
