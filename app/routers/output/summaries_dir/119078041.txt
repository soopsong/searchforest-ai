string theory provides numerous examples of duality between gravitational theories and unitary gauge theories . to resolve the black hole information paradox in this setting , it is necessary to better understand how unitarity is implemented on the gravity side . we argue that unitarity is restored by nonlocal effects whose initial magnitude is suppressed by the exponential of the bekenstein - hawking entropy . time - slicings for which effective field theory is valid are obtained by demanding the mutual back - reaction of quanta be small . the resulting bounds imply that nonlocal effects do not lead to observable violations of causality or conflict with the equivalence principle for infalling observers , yet implement information retrieval for observers who stay outside the black hole .
