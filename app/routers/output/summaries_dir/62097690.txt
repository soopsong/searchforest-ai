we present two efficient quantum key distribution schemes over two different collective - noise channels . the accepted hypothesis of collective noise is that photons travel inside a time window small compared to the variation of noise . noiseless subspaces are made up of two bell states and the spatial degree of freedom is introduced to form two nonorthogonal bases . although these protocols resort to entangled states for encoding the key bit , the receiver is only required to perform single - particle product measurements and there is no basis mismatch . moreover , the detection is passive as the receiver does not switch his measurements between two conjugate measurement bases to get the key .
