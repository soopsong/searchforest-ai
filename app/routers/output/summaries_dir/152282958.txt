we demonstrate how to manipulate quantum chaos with a single photon in a hybrid quantum device combining cavity qed and optomechanics . specifically , we show that this system changes between integrable and chaotic relying on the photon - state of the injected field . this onset of chaos originates from the photon - dependent chaotic threshold of the qubit - field coupling induced by the optomechanical interaction . by deriving the loschmidt echo we observe clear differences in the sensitivity to perturbations in the regular versus chaotic regimes . we also present classical analog of this chaotic behavior , and find good correspondence between chaotic quantum dynamics and classical physics . our work opens up a new route to achieve quantum manipulations , which are crucial elements in engineering new types of on - chip quantum devices and quantum information science .
