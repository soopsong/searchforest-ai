twin entangled beams produced by single - pass parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) offer the opportunity to detect weak amount of absorption with an improved sensitivity with respect to standard techniques which make use of classical light sources . we propose a differential measurement scheme which exploits the spatial quantum correlation of type ii pdc to image a weak amplitude object with a sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit imposed by shot - noise .
