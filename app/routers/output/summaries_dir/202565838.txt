methods of processing quantum data become more important as quantum computing devices improve their quality towards fault tolerant universal quantum computers . these methods include discrimination and filtering of quantum states given as an input to the device that may find numerous applications in quantum information technologies . in the present paper , we address a scheme of a classification of input states , which is nondestructive and deterministic for certain inputs , while probabilistic , in general case . this can be achieved by incorporating phase estimation algorithm into the hybrid quantum - classical computation scheme , where quantum block is trained classically . we perform proof - of - principle implementation of this idea using superconducting quantum processor of ibm quantum experience . another aspect we are interested in is a mitigation of errors occurring due to the quantum device imperfections . we apply a series of heuristic tricks at the stage of classical postprocessing in order to improve raw experimental data and to recognize patterns in them . these ideas may find applications in other realization of hybrid quantum - classical computations with noisy quantum machines .
