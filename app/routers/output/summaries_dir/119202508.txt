the behavior of general nonclassical two - mode gaussian states at a beam splitter is investigated . single - mode nonclassicality as well as two - mode entanglement of both input and output states are analyzed suggesting their suitable quantifiers . these quantifiers are derived from local and global invariants of linear unitary two - mode transformations such that the sum of input ( or output ) local nonclassicality measures and entanglement measure gives a global invariant . this invariant quantifies the global nonclassicality resource . mutual transformations of local nonclassicalities and entanglement induced by the beam splitter are analyzed considering incident noisy twin beams , single - mode noisy squeezed vacuum states , and states encompassing both squeezed states and twin beams . a rich tapestry of interesting nonclassical output states is predicted .
