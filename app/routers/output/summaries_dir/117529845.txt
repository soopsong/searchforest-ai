quantum error correction ( qec ) is a crucial step towards long coherence times required for efficient quantum information processing ( qip ) . one major challenge in this direction concerns the fast real - time analysis of error syndrome measurements and the associated feedback control . recent proposals on autonomous qec ( aqec ) have opened new perspectives to overcome this difficulty . here , we design an aqec scheme based on quantum reservoir engineering adapted to superconducting qubits . we focus on a three - qubit bit - flip code , where three transmon qubits are dispersively coupled to a few low - q resonator modes . by applying only continuous - wave drives of fixed but well - chosen frequencies and amplitudes , we engineer an effective interaction hamiltonian to evacuate the entropy created by eventual bit - flip errors . we provide a full analytical and numerical study of the protocol , while introducing the main limitations on the achievable error correction rates .
