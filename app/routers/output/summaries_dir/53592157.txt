the recent discovery of fully - homomorphic classical encryption schemes has had a dramatic effect on the direction of modern cryptography . such schemes , however , implicitly rely on the assumptions that solving certain computation problems are intractable . here we present a quantum encryption scheme which is homomorphic for arbitrary classical and quantum circuits which have at most some constant number of non - clifford gates . unlike classical schemes , the security of the scheme we present is information theoretic and hence independent of the computational power of an adversary .
