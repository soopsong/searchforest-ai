we measure and analyze reflection spectra of directly coupled systems of waveguides and cavities . the observed fano lines offer insight in the reflection and coupling processes . very different from side - coupled systems , the observed fano line shape is not caused by the termini of the waveguide , but the coupling process between the measurement device fiber and the waveguide . our experimental results and analytical model show that the fano parameter that describes the fano line shape is very sensitive to the coupling condition . a movement of the fiber well below the rayleigh range can lead to a drastic change of the fano line shape .
