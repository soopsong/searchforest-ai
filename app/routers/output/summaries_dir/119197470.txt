the partial transpose ( pt ) is an important function for entanglement testing and quantification and also for the study of geometrical aspects of the quantum state space . in this article , considering general bipartite and multipartite discrete systems , explicit formulas ready for the numerical implementation of the pt and of related entanglement functions are presented and the fortran code produced for that purpose is described . what is more , we obtain an analytical expression for the hilbert - schmidt entanglement of two - qudit systems and for the associated closest separable state . in contrast to previous works on this matter , we only use the properties of the pt , not applying lagrange multipliers .
