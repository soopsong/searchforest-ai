in this paper we show that the eigenvalue map and the symplectic eigenvalue map of positive definite matrices are lipschitz for the cartan - hadamard riemannian metric , and establish log - majorizations for the ( symplectic ) eigenvalues of the cartan barycenter of integrable probability borel measures . this leads a version of jensen 's inequality for geometric integrals of matrix - valued integrable random variables .
