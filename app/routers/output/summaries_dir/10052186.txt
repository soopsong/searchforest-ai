in this paper , we demonstrate that interleaved sampling techniques can be used to characterize the hamiltonian of a qubit and its environmental decoherence rate . the technique offers a significant advantage in terms of the number of measurements that are required to characterize a qubit . when compared to the standard nyquist - shannon sampling rate , the saving in the total measurement time for the interleaved method is approximately proportional to the ratio of the sample rates .
