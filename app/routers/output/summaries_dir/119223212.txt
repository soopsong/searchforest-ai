digital quantum computing paradigm offers highly - desirable features such as universality , scalability , and quantum error correction . however , physical resource requirements to implement useful error - corrected quantum algorithms are prohibitive in the current era of nisq devices . as an alternative path to performing universal quantum computation , within the nisq era limitations , we propose to merge digital single - qubit operations with analog multi - qubit entangling blocks in an approach we call digital - analog quantum computing ( daqc ) . along these lines , although the techniques may be extended to any resource , we propose to use unitaries generated by the ubiquitous ising hamiltonian for the analog entangling block and we prove its universal character . we construct explicit daqc protocols for efficient simulations of arbitrary inhomogeneous ising , two - body , and $ m$-body spin hamiltonian dynamics by means of single - qubit gates and a fixed homogeneous ising hamiltonian . additionally , we compare a sequential approach where the interactions are switched on and off ( stepwise daqc ) with an always - on multi - qubit interaction interspersed by fast single - qubit pulses ( banged daqc ) . finally , we perform numerical tests comparing purely digital schemes with daqc protocols , showing a remarkably better performance of the latter . the proposed daqc approach combines the robustness of analog quantum computing with the flexibility of digital methods , establishing an avenue for achieving quantum advantage with near - term quantum hardware .
