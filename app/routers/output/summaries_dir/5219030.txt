a nonclassical light source is used to demonstrate experimentally the absolute efficiency calibration of a photon - number - resolving detector . the photon - pair detector calibration method developed by klyshko for single - photon detectors is generalized to take advantage of the higher dynamic range and additional information provided by photon - number - resolving detectors . this enables the use of brighter twin - beam sources including amplified pulse pumped sources , which increases the relevant signal and provides measurement redundancy , making the calibration more robust .
