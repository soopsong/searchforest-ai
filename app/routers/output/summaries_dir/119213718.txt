we study the kimble - braunstein continuous - variable quantum teleportation with the quantum channel physically realized in the turbulent atmosphere . in this context , we examine the applicability of different strategies preserving the gaussian entanglement [ bohmann et al . , phys . rev . a 94 , 010302(r ) ( 2016 ) ] for improving the fidelity of the coherent - state teleportation . first , we demonstrate that increasing the squeezing parameter characterizing the entangled state is restricted by its optimal value , which we derive for realistic experimentally - verified examples . further , we consider the technique of adaptive correlations of losses and show its performance for channels with large squeezing parameters . finally , we investigate the efficiencies of postselection strategies in dependence on the stochastic properties of the channel transmittance .
