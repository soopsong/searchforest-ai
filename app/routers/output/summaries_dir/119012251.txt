we analyze an experimental method for creating interesting nonclassical states by processing the entanglement generated when two large coherent states interact in a cross - kerr medium . we specifically investigate the effects of loss and noise in every mode of the experiment , as well as the effect of"binning"the post - selection outcomes . even with these imperfections , we find an optimal set of currently - achievable parameters which would allow a proof - of - principle demonstration of number squeezing in states with large mean photon number . we discuss other useful states which can be generated with the same experimental tools , including a class of states which contain coherent superpositions of differing photon numbers , e.g. good approximations to the state $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 } } ( |0\rangle+|20\rangle)$. finally , we suggest one possible application of this state in the field of optomechanics .
