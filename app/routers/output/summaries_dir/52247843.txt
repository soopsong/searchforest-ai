superconducting flux qubits are a promising candidate for realizing quantum information processing and quantum simulations . such devices behave like artificial atoms , with the advantage that one can easily tune the"atoms"internal properties . here , by harnessing this flexibility , we propose a technique to minimize the inhomogeneous broadening of a large ensemble of flux qubits by tuning only the external flux . in addition , as an example of many - body physics in such an ensemble , we show how to observe superradiance , and its quadratic scaling with ensemble size , using a tailored microwave control pulse that takes advantage of the inhomogeneous broadening itself to excite only a sub - ensemble of the qubits . our scheme opens up an approach to using superconducting circuits to explore the properties of quantum many - body systems .
