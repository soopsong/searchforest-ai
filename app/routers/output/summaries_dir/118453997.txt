it is known that the metric and palatini formalisms of gravity theories have their own interesting features but also suffer from some different drawbacks . recently , a novel gravity theory called hybrid metric - palatini gravity was put forward to cure or improve their individual deficiencies . the action of this gravity theory is a hybrid combination of the usual einstein - hilbert action and a $ f(\mathcal{r})$ term constructed by the palatini formalism . interestingly , it seems that the existence of a light and long - range scalar field in this gravity may modify the cosmological and galactic dynamics without conflicting with the laboratory and solar system tests . in this paper we focus on the tensor perturbation of thick branes in this novel gravity theory . we consider two models as examples , namely , the thick branes constructed by a background scalar field and by pure gravity . the thick branes in both models have no inner structure . however , the graviton zero mode in the first model has inner structure when the parameter in this model is larger than its critical value . we find that the effective four - dimensional gravity can be reproduced on the brane for both models . moreover , the stability of both brane systems against the tensor perturbation can also be ensured .
