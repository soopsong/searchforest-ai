two quantum events , represented by positive operators ( effects ) , are coexistent if they can occur as possible outcomes in a single measurement scheme . equivalently , the corresponding effects are coexistent if and only if they are contained in the ranges of a single ( joint ) observable . here we give several equivalent characterizations of coexistent pairs of qubit effects . we also establish the equivalence between our results and those obtained independently by other authors . our approach makes explicit use of the minkowski space geometry inherent in the four - dimensional real vector space of selfadjoint operators in a two - dimensional complex hilbert space .
