we demonstrate slot - mode optomechanical crystals , a class of device in which photonic and phononic crystal nanobeam resonators separated by a narrow slot are coupled through optomechanical interactions . in these geometries , nanobeam pairs are patterned so that a mechanical breathing mode is confined at the center of one beam , and a high quality factor ( qo>10 ^ 5 ) optical mode is confined in the slot between the beams . here , we produce slot - mode devices in a stoichiometric si3n4 platform , with optical modes in the 980 nm band , coupled to breathing mechanical modes at 3.4 ghz , 1.8 ghz , and 400 mhz . we exploit the high si3n4 tensile stress to achieve slot widths down to 24 nm , which leads to enhanced optomechanical coupling , sufficient for the observation of optomechanical self - oscillations at all studied frequencies . we utilize the slot mode concept to develop multimode optomechanical systems with triple - beam geometries , in which two optical modes are coupled to a single mechanical mode , and two mechanical modes are coupled to a single optical mode . this concept allows great flexibility in the design of multimode chip - scale optomechanical systems with large optomechanical coupling at a wide range of mechanical frequencies .
