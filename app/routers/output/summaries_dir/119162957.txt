we present a new application of harmonic analysis to quantum information by constructing intriguing classes of quantum channels stemming from specific representations of multiplier algebras over locally compact groups $ g$. beginning with a representation of the measure algebra $ m(g)$ , we unify and elaborate on recent counter - examples to fixed point subalgebras in infinite dimensions , as well as present an application to the noiseless subsystems method of quantum error correction . using a representation of the completely bounded fourier multiplier algebra $ mcba(g)$ , we provide a new class of counter - examples to the recently solved asymptotic quantum birkhoff conjecture , along with a systematic method of producing the examples using a geometric representation of schur maps . further properties of our channels including duality , quantum capacity , and entanglement preservation are discussed along with potential applications to additivity conjectures .
