the aims of this paper are two . the first is to give a brief review of the most relevant theoretical results concerning the uniqueness of the steady - state solution of the lindblad - gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan master equation and the criteria which guarantee relaxingness and irreducibility of dynamical semigroups . in particular , we test and discuss their physical meaning by considering their applicability to the characterisation of the simplest open quantum system \emph{i.e . } a two - level system coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators at zero temperature . the second aim is to provide a set of sufficient conditions which guarantees the uniqueness of the steady - state solution and its attractivity . starting from simple assumptions , we derive simple criteria that can be efficiently exploited to characterise the behavior of dissipative systems of spins and bosons ( with truncated fock space ) , and a wide variety of other open quantum systems recently studied .
