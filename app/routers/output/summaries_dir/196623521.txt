artificial spiking neural networks have found applications in areas where the temporal nature of activation offers an advantage , such as time series prediction and signal processing . to improve their efficiency , spiking architectures often run on custom - designed neuromorphic hardware , but , despite their attractive properties , these implementations have been limited to digital systems . we describe an artificial quantum spiking neuron that relies on the dynamical evolution of two easy to implement hamiltonians and subsequent local measurements . the architecture allows exploiting complex amplitudes and back - action from measurements to influence the input . this approach to learning protocols is advantageous in the case where the input and output of the system are both quantum states . we demonstrate this through the classification of bell pairs which can be seen as a certification protocol . stacking the introduced elementary building blocks into larger networks combines the spatiotemporal features of a spiking neural network with the non - local quantum correlations across the graph .
