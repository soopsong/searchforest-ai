we report a theoretical study of the electromagnetic waves ( ews ) propagation through an array of superconducting qubits , i.e. coherent two - level systems , embedded in a low - dissipative transmission line . we focus on the near - resonant case as the frequency of ews $ \omega \simeq \omega_q$ , where $ \omega_q$ is the qubit frequency . in this limit we derive the effective dynamic nonlinear wave equation allowing one to obtain the frequency dependent transmission coefficient of ews , $ d(\omega)$. in the linear regime and a relatively wide frequency region we obtain a strong resonant suppression of $ d(\omega)$ in both cases of a single qubit and chains composed of a large number of densely arranged qubits . however , in narrow frequency regions a chain of qubits allows the resonant transmission of ews with greatly enhanced $ d(\omega)$. in the nonlinear regime realized for a moderate power of applied microwave radiation , we predict and analyze various transitions between states characterized by high and low values of $ d(\omega)$. these transitions are manifestations of nonequilibrium steady states of an array of qubits achieved in this regime .
