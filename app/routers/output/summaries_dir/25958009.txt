we investigate several aspects of realizing quantum computation using entangled polar molecules in pendular states . quantum algorithms typically start from a product state |00 ... 0 > and we show that up to a negligible error , the ground states of polar molecule arrays can be considered as the unentangled qubit basis state |00 ... 0 > . this state can be prepared by simply allowing the system to reach thermal equilibrium at low temperature ( < 1 mk ) . we also evaluate entanglement , characterized by the concurrence of pendular state qubits in dipole arrays as governed by the external electric field , dipole - dipole coupling and number n of molecules in the array . in the parameter regime that we consider for quantum computing , we find that qubit entanglement is modest , typically no greater than 0.0001 , confirming the negligible entanglement in the ground state . we discuss methods for realizing quantum computation in the gate model , measurement based model , instantaneous quantum polynomial time circuits and the adiabatic model using polar molecules in pendular states .
