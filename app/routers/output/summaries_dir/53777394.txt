we study optomechanically induced transparency ( omit ) in a compound system consisting of coupled optical resonators and a mechanical mode , focusing on the unconventional role of loss . we find that optical transparency can emerge at the otherwise strongly absorptive regime in the omit spectrum , by using an external nanotip to enhance the optical loss . in particular , loss - induced revival of optical transparency and the associated slow - to - fast light switch can be identified in the vicinity of an exceptional point . these results open up a counterintuitive way to engineer micro - mechanical devices with tunable losses for e.g. , coherent optical switch and communications .
