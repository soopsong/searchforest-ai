terahertz ( thz ) communication is a topic of much research in the context of high - capacity next - generation wireless networks . quantum communication is also a topic of intensive research , most recently in the context of space - based deployments . in this work we explore the use of thz frequencies as a means to achieve quantum communication within a constellation of micro - satellites in low - earth - orbit ( leo ) . quantum communication between the micro - satellite constellation and high - altitude terrestrial stations is also investigated . our work demonstrates that thz quantum entanglement distribution and thz quantum key distribution are viable deployment options in the micro - satellite context . we discuss how such deployment opens up the possibility for simpler integration of global quantum and wireless networks . the possibility of using thz frequencies for quantum - radar applications in the context of leo deployments is briefly discussed .
