the use of quantum computing for applications involving optimization has been regarded as one of the areas it may prove to be advantageous ( against classical computation ) . to further improve the quality of the solutions , post - processing techniques are often used on the results of quantum optimization . one such recent approach is the multi qubit correction ( mqc ) algorithm by dorband . in this paper , we will discuss and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of this technique . then based on our discussion , we perform an experiment on how pairing heuristics on the input of mqc can affect the results of a quantum optimizer and a comparison between mqc and the built - in optimization method that d - wave systems offers . among our results , we are able to show that the built - in post - processing rarely beats mqc in our tests . we hope that by using the ideas and insights presented in this paper , researchers and developers will be able to make a more informed decision on what kind of post - processing methods to use for their quantum optimization needs .
