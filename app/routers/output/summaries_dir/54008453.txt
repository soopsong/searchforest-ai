the interaction among the components of a hybrid quantum system is often neglected when considering the coupling of these components to an environment . however , if the interaction strength is large , this approximation leads to unphysical predictions , as has been shown for cavity - qed and optomechanical systems in the ultrastrong - coupling regime . to deal with these cases , master equations with dissipators retaining the interaction between these components have been derived for the quantum rabi model and for the standard optomechanical hamiltonian . in this article , we go beyond these previous derivations and present a general master equation approach for arbitrary hybrid quantum systems interacting with thermal reservoirs . specifically , our approach can be applied to describe the dynamics of open hybrid systems with harmonic , quasi - harmonic , and anharmonic transitions . we apply our approach to study the influence of temperature on multiphoton vacuum rabi oscillations in circuit qed . we also analyze the influence of temperature on the conversion of mechanical energy into photon pairs in an optomechanical system , which has been recently described at zero temperature . we compare our results with previous approaches , finding that these sometimes overestimate decoherence rates and understimate excited - state populations .
