wave - particle duality is a typical example of bohr 's complementarity principle that plays a significant role in quantum mechanics . previous studies used the visibility of an interference pattern to quantify the wave property and used path information to quantify the particle property . however , coherence is the core and basis of the interference phenomenon . if we could use coherence to characterize the wave property , the understanding of wave - particle duality would be strengthened . a recent theoretical work [ phys . rev . lett . 116 , 160406 ( 2016 ) ] found two relations between quantum coherence and path information . here , we demonstrate the new measure of wave - particle duality based on two kinds of coherence measures quantitatively for the first time . the wave property , quantified by the coherence in the l1-norm measure and the relative entropy measure , can be obtained via tomography of the target state , which is encoded in the path degree of freedom of the photons . the particle property , quantified by the path information , can be obtained via the discrimination of detector states , which is encoded in the polarization degree of freedom of the photons . our work may deepen people 's understanding of coherence and provide a new perspective regarding wave - particle duality .
