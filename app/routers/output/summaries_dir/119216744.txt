we propose a newtonian semiclassical gravity theory based on the grw collapse theory with matter density ontology ( grwm ) , which we term grwmn . the theory is proposed because , as we show , the standard newtonian semiclassical gravity theory based on the schroedinger - newton equations does not have a consistent born rule probability interpretation for gravitationally self - interacting particles and implies gravitational cat states for macroscopic mass superpositions . by contrast , we show that grwmn has a consistent statistical description of gravitationally self - interacting particles and adequately suppresses the cat states for macroscopic superpositions . two possible routes to experimentally testing grwmn are also considered . we conclude with a discussion of possible variants of grwmn , what a general relativistic extension would involve , and various objections that might be raised against semiclassical gravity theories like grwmn .
