we study the problem of compilation of quantum algorithms into optimized physical - level circuits executable in a quantum information processing ( qip ) experiment based on trapped atomic ions . we report a complete strategy : starting with an algorithm in the form of a quantum computer program , we compile it into a high - level logical circuit that goes through multiple stages of decomposition into progressively lower - level circuits until we reach the physical execution - level specification . we skip the fault - tolerance layer , as it is not within the scope of this work . the different stages are structured so as to best assist with the overall optimization while taking into account numerous optimization criteria , including minimizing the number of expensive two - qubit gates , minimizing the number of less expensive single - qubit gates , optimizing the runtime , minimizing the overall circuit error , and optimizing classical control sequences . our approach allows a trade - off between circuit runtime and quantum error , as well as to accommodate future changes in the optimization criteria that may likely arise as a result of the anticipated improvements in the physical - level control of the experiment .
