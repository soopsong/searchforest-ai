we present a new open - source python package , krotov , implementing the quantum optimal control method of that name . it allows to determine time - dependent external fields for a wide range of quantum control problems , including state - to - state transfer , quantum gate implementation and optimization for an arbitrary perfect entangler . the user - friendly interface allows for combination with other python packages , and thus high - level customization . the package is being developed at https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov
