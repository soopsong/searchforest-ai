a comparison is made of various searching procedures , based upon different entanglement measures or entanglement indicators , for highly entangled multi - qubits states . in particular , our present results are compared with those recently reported by brown et al . [ j. phys . a : math . gen . 38 ( 2005 ) 1119 ] . the statistical distribution of entanglement values for the aforementioned multi - qubit systems is also explored .
