we study quantum systems on a discrete bounded lattice ( lattice billiards ) . the statistical properties of their spectra show universal features related to the regular or chaotic character of their classical continuum counterparts . however , the decay dynamics of the open systems appear very different from the continuum case , their properties being dominated by the states in the band center . we identify a class of states ( " lattice scars " ) that survive for infinite times in dissipative systems and that are degenerate at the center of the band . we provide analytical arguments for their existence in any bipartite lattice , and give a formula to determine their number . these states should be relevant to quantum transport in discrete systems , and we discuss how to observe them using photonic waveguides , cold atoms in optical lattices , and quantum circuits .
