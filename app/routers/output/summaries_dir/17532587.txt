the study of open quantum systems is important for fundamental issues of quantum physics as well as for technological applications such as quantum information processing . recent developments in this field have increased our basic understanding on how non - markovian effects influence the dynamics of an open quantum system , paving the way to exploit memory effects for various quantum control tasks . most often , the environment of an open system is thought to act as a sink for the system information . however , here we demonstrate experimentally that a photonic open system can exploit the information initially held by its environment . correlations in the environmental degrees of freedom induce nonlocal memory effects where the bipartite open system displays , counterintuitively , local markovian and global non - markovian character . our results also provide novel methods to protect and distribute entanglement , and to experimentally quantify correlations in photonic environments .
