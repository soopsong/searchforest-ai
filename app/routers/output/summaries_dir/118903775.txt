raman - type laser excitation of a trapped atom allows one to realize the quantum mechanical counterpart of phenomena of nonlinear optics , such as kerr - type nonlinearities , parametric amplification , and multi - mode mixing . additionally , huge nonlinearities emerge from the interference of the atomic wave function with the laser waves . they lead to a partitioning of the phase space accompanied by a significantly different action of the time evolution in neighboring phase - space zones . for example , a nonlinearly modified coherent"displacement"of the motional quantum state may induce strong amplitude squeezing and quantum interferences .
