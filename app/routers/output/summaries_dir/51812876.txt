we propose and analyze a nanomechanical architecture where light is used to perform linear quantum operations on a set of many vibrational modes . suitable amplitude modulation of a single laser beam is shown to generate squeezing , entanglement , and state - transfer between modes that are selected according to their mechanical oscillation frequency . current optomechanical devices based on photonic crystals may provide a platform for realizing this scheme .
