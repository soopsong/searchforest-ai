correlations exhibited by neutrino oscillations are studied via quantum information theoretic quantities . we show that the strongest type of entanglement , genuine multipartite entanglement , is persistent in the flavour changing states . we prove the existence of bell - type nonlocal features , in both its absolute and genuine avatars . finally , we show that a measure of nonclassicality , dissension , which is a generalization of quantum discord to the tripartite case , is nonzero for almost the entire range of time in the evolution of an initial electron - neutrino . via these quantum information theoretic quantities capturing different aspects of quantum correlations , we elucidate the differences between the flavour types , shedding light on the quantum - information theoretic aspects of the weak force .
