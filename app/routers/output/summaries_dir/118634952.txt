we study the entanglement of an impurity at one end of a spin chain with a block of spins using negativity as a true measure of entanglement to characterize the unique features of the gapless kondo regime in the spin chain kondo model . for this spin chain in the kondo regime we determine- with a true entanglement measure- the spatial extent of the kondo screening cloud , we propose an ansatz for its ground state and demonstrate that the impurity spin is indeed maximally entangled with the cloud . to better evidence the peculiarities of the kondo regime , we carry a parallel analysis of the entanglement properties of the kondo spin chain model in the gapped dimerised regime . our study shows how a genuine entanglement measure stemming from quantum information theory can fully characterize also non perturbative regimes accessible to certain condensed matter systems .
