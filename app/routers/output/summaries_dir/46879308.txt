rydberg atom - based electrometry enables traceable electric field measurements with high sensitivity over a large frequency range , from gigahertz to terahertz . such measurements are particularly useful for the calibration of radio frequency and terahertz devices , as well as other applications like near field imaging of electric fields . we utilize frequency modulated spectroscopy with active control of residual amplitude modulation to improve the signal to noise ratio of the optical readout of rydberg atom - based radio frequency electrometry . matched filtering of the signal is also implemented . although we have reached similarly , high sensitivity with other read - out methods , frequency modulated spectroscopy is advantageous because it is well - suited for building a compact , portable sensor . in the current experiment , $ \sim 3 \mu v cm^{-1}hz^{-1/2}$ sensitivity is achieved and is found to be photon shot noise limited .
