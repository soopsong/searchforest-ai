we present a deterministic entanglement purification protocol ( epp ) working for currently available experiment technique . in this protocol , we resort to the robust time - bin entanglement to purify the polarization entanglement determinately , which is quite different from the previous epps . after purification , one can obtain a completely pure maximally entangled pair with the success probability of 100 % , in principle . as the maximal polarization entanglement is of vice importance in long - distance quantum communication , this protocol may have a wide application .
