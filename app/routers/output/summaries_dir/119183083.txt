quantum information processing is expressed using quantum bits ( qubits ) and quantum gates which are arranged in the terms of quantum circuits . here , each qubit is associated to a quantum circuit wire which is used to conduct the desired operations . most of the existing quantum circuits allocate a single quantum circuit wire for each qubit and , hence , introduce a significant overhead . in fact , qubits are usually not needed during the entire computation but only between their initialization and measurement . before and after that , corresponding wires may be used by other qubits . in this work , we propose a solution which exploits this fact in order to optimize the design of quantum circuits with respect to the required wires . to this end , we introduce a representation of the lifetimes of all qubits which is used to analyze the respective need for wires . based on this analysis , a method is proposed which"recycles"the available wires and , by this , reduces the size of the resulting circuit . experimental evaluations based on established reversible and fault - tolerant quantum circuits confirm that the proposed solution reduces the amount of wires by more than 90 % compared to unoptimized quantum circuits .
