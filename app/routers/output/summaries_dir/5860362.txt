we identify the quantum channels corresponding to the interaction of a gaussian quantum state with an already formed schwarzschild black hole . using recent advances in the classification of one - mode bosonic gaussian channels we find that ( with one exception ) the black hole gaussian channels lie in the non - entanglement breaking subset of the lossy channels c(loss ) , amplifying channels c(amp ) and classical - noise channels b2 . we show that the channel parameters depend on the black hole mass and the properties of the potential barrier surrounding it . this classification enables us to calculate the classical and quantum capacity of the black hole and to estimate the quantum capacity where no tractable quantum capacity expression exists today . we discuss these findings in the light of the black hole quantum information loss problem .
