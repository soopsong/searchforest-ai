device - independent quantum key distribution ( diqkd ) is a formalism that supersedes traditional quantum key distribution , as its security does not rely on any detailed modelling of the internal working of the devices . this strong form of security is possible only using devices producing correlations that violate a bell inequality . full security proofs of diqkd have been recently reported , but they tolerate zero or small amounts of noise and are restricted to protocols based on specific bell inequalities . here , we provide a security proof of diqkd that is both more efficient and noise resistant , and also more general as it applies to protocols based on arbitrary bell inequalities and can be adapted to cover supra - quantum eavesdroppers limited by the no - signalling principle only . it requires , however , the extra assumption that the adversary does not have a long - term quantum memory , a condition that is not a limitation at present since the best existing quantum memories have very short coherence times .
