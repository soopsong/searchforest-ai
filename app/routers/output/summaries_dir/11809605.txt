the assumption of maximum parallelism support for the successful realization of scalable quantum computers has led to homogeneous , " sea - of - qubits " architectures . the resulting architectures overcome the primary challenges of reliability and scalability at the cost of physically unacceptable system area . we find that by exploiting the natural serialization at both the application and the physical microarchitecture level of a quantum computer , we can reduce the area requirement while improving performance . in particular we present a scalable quantum architecture design that employs specialization of the system into memory and computational regions , each individually optimized to match hardware support to the available parallelism . through careful application and system analysis , we find that our new architecture can yield up to a factor of thirteen savings in area due to specialization . in addition , by providing a memory hierarchy design for quantum computers , we can increase time performance by a factor of eight . this result brings us closer to the realization of a quantum processor that can solve meaningful problems .
