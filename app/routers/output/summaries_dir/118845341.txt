we study the time evolution of the entanglement negativity after a local quantum quench in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional conformal field theories ( cfts ) , which we introduce by suddenly joining two initially decoupled cfts at their endpoints . we calculate the negativity evolution for both adjacent intervals and disjoint intervals explicitly . for two adjacent intervals , the entanglement negativity grows logarithmically in time right after the quench . after developing a plateau - like feature , the entanglement negativity drops to the ground - state value . for the case of two spatially separated intervals , a light - cone behavior is observed in the negativity evolution ; in addition , a long - range entanglement , which is independent of the distance between two intervals , can be created . our results agree with the heuristic picture that quasiparticles , which carry entanglement , are emitted from the joining point and propagate freely through the system . our analytical results are confirmed by numerical calculations based on a critical harmonic chain .
