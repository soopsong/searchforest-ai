we present experimental techniques and results related to the optimization and characterization of our nanofiber - based atom trap [ vetsch et al . , phys . rev . lett . 104 , 203603 ( 2010 ) ] . the atoms are confined in an optical lattice which is created using a two - color evanescent field surrounding the optical nanofiber . for this purpose , the polarization state of the trapping light fields has to be properly adjusted . we demonstrate that this can be accomplished by analyzing the light scattered by the nanofiber . furthermore , we show that loading the nanofiber trap from a magneto - optical trap leads to sub - doppler temperatures of the trapped atomic ensemble and yields a sub - poissonian distribution of the number of trapped atoms per trapping site .
