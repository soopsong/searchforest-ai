we introduce new entanglement monotones which generalize , to the case of many parties , those which give rise to the majorization - based partial ordering of bipartite states ' entanglement . we give some examples of restrictions they impose on deterministic and probabilistic conversion between multipartite states via local actions and classical communication . these include restrictions which do not follow from any bipartite considerations . we derive supermultiplicativity relations between each state 's monotones and the monotones for collective processing when the parties share several states . we also investigate polynomial invariants under local unitary transformations , and show that a large class of these are invariant under collective unitary processing and also multiplicative , putting restrictions , for example , on the exact conversion of multiple copies of one state to multiple copies of another .
