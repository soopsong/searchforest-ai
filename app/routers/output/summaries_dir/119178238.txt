a quantum flywheel is studied with the purpose of storing useful work in quantum levels , while additional power is extracted continuously from the device . the flywheel gains its energy form a quantum heat engine . generally , when a work repository is quantized the work exchange with the engine is accompanied with heat exchange , which may degrade the charging efficiency . in the particular realization of a quantum harmonic oscillator work repository , quantum and thermal fluctuations dominates the dynamics . quantum monitoring and feedback control are applied to the flywheel , as it is shown to be an essential part of stabilizing and regulating its state of operation , and bringing the system to a steady state . a particular balance between information gained by measuring the system and the information fed back to the system is found to maximize the charging efficiency . the dynamics of the flywheel are described by a stochastic master equation that accounts for the engine , the external driving , the measurement , and the feedback operations .
