we show how bond order emerges due to light mediated synthetic interactions in ultracold atoms in optical lattices in an optical cavity . this is a consequence of the competition between both short- and long - range interactions designed by choosing the optical geometry . light induces effective many - body interactions that modify the landscape of quantum phases supported by the typical bose - hubbard model . using exact diagonalization of small system sizes in one dimension , we present the many - body quantum phases the system can support via the interplay between the density and bond ( or matter - wave coherence ) interactions . we find numerical evidence to support that dimer phases due to bond order are analogous to valence bond states . different possibilities of light - induced atomic interactions are considered that go beyond the typical atomic system with dipolar and other intrinsic interactions . this will broaden the hamiltonian toolbox available for quantum simulation of condensed matter physics via atomic systems .
