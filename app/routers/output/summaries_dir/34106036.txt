physical realizability addresses the question of whether it is possible to implement a given linear time invariant ( lti ) system as a quantum system . a given synthesized quantum controller described by a set of stochastic differential equations does not necessarily correspond to a physically meaningful quantum system . however , if additional quantum noises are permitted in the implementation , it is always possible to implement an arbitrary lti system as a quantum system . in this paper , we give an expression for the number of introduced noise channels required to implement a given lti system as a quantum system . we then consider the special case where only the transfer function to be implemented is of interest . we give results showing when it is possible to implement a transfer function as a quantum system by introducing the same number of quantum noises as there are system outputs . finally , we demonstrate the utility of these results by providing an algorithm for obtaining a suboptimal solution to a coherent quantum lqg control problem .
