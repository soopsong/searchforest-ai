quantum annealing is explored as a resource for quantum information beyond solution of classical combinatorial problems . envisaged as a generator of robust interferometric probes , we examine a hamiltonian of $ n>>1 $ uniformly - coupled spins subject to a transverse magnetic field . the discrete many - body problem is mapped onto dynamics of a single one - dimensional particle in a continuous potential . this reveals all the qualitative features of the ground state beyond typical mean - field or large classical spin models . it illustrates explicitly a graceful warping from an entangled unimodal to bi - modal ground state in the phase transition region . the transitional ` goldilocks ' probe has a component distribution of width $ n^{2/3}$ and exhibits characteristics for enhanced phase estimation in a decoherent environment . in the presence of realistic local noise and collective dephasing , we find this probe state asymptotically saturates ultimate precision bounds calculated previously . by reducing the transverse field adiabatically , the goldilocks probe is prepared in advance of the minimum gap bottleneck , allowing the annealing schedule to be terminated ` early ' . adiabatic time complexity of probe preparation is shown to be linear in $ n$
