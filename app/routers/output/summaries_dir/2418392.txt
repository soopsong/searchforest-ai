bosonic channels are important in practice as they form a simple model for free - space or fiber - optic communication . here we consider a single - sender two - receiver pure - loss bosonic broadcast channel and determine the unconstrained capacity region for the distillation of bipartite entanglement and secret key between the sender and each receiver , whenever they are allowed arbitrary public classical communication . we show how the state merging protocol leads to achievable rates in this setting , giving an inner bound on the capacity region . we also evaluate an outer bound on the region by using the relative entropy of entanglement and a ` reduction by teleportation ' technique . the outer bounds match the inner bounds in the infinite - energy limit , thereby establishing the unconstrained capacity region for such channels . our result could provide a useful benchmark for implementing a broadcasting of entanglement and secret key through such channels . an important open question relevant to practice is to determine the capacity region in both this setting and the single - sender single - receiver case when there is an energy constraint on the transmitter .
