effective gauge fields have allowed the emulation of matter under strong magnetic fields leading to the realization of harper - hofstadter , haldane models , and led to demonstrations of one - way waveguides and topologically protected edge states . central to these discoveries is the chirality induced by time - symmetry breaking . due to the discovery of quantum search algorithms based on walks on graphs , recent work has discovered new implications the effect of time - reversal symmetry breaking has on the transport of quantum states and has brought with it a host of new experimental implementations . we provide a full classification of the unitary operators defining quantum processes which break time - reversal symmetry in their induced transition properties between basis elements in a preferred site - basis . our results are furthermore proven in terms of the geometry of the corresponding hamiltonian support graph and hence provide a topological classification . a quantum process of this type is necessarily time - symmetric for any choice of time - independent hamiltonian if and only if the underlying support graph is bipartite . moreover , for non - bipartite support , there exists a time - independent hamiltonian with necessarily complex edge weights that induces time - asymmetric transition probabilities between edge(s ) . we further prove that certain bipartite graphs give rise to transition probability suppression , but not broken time - reversal symmetry . these results fill an important missing gap in understanding the role this omnipresent effect has in quantum physics . furthermore , through our development of a general framework , along the way to our results we completely characterize gauge potentials on combinatorial graphs .
