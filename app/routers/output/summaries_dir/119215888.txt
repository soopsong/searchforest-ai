we study"field space entanglement"in certain quantum field theories consisting of n number of free scalar fields interacting with each other via kinetic mixing terms . we present exact analytic expressions for entanglement end renyi entropies between arbitrary number of scalar fields by which we could explore certain entanglement inequalities . other entanglement measures such as mutual information and entanglement negativity have also been studied . we also give some comments about possible holographic realizations of such models .
