we investigate the open dynamics of a qubit due to scattering of a single photon in an infinite or semi - infinite waveguide . through an exact solution of the time - dependent multi - photon scattering problem , we find the qubit 's dynamical map . tools of open quantum systems theory allow us then to discuss the general features of this map , find the corresponding non - linbladian master equation , and assess in a rigorous way its non - markovian nature . the qubit dynamics has distinctive features that , in particular , do not occur in emission processes . two fundamental sources of non - markovianity are present : the finite width of the photon wavepacket and the time delay for propagation between the qubit and the end of the semi - infinite waveguide .
