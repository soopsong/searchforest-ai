state preparation via conditional output measurement on a beam splitter is studied , assuming the signal mode is mixed with a mode prepared in a fock state and photon numbers are measured in one of the output channels . it is shown that the mode in the other output channel is prepared in either a photon - subtracted or a photon - added jacobi polynomial state , depending upon the difference between the number of photons in the input fock state and the number of photons in the output fock state onto which it is projected . the properties of the conditional output states are studied for coherent and squeezed input states , and the probabilities of generating the states are calculated . relations to other states , such as near - photon - number states and squeezed - state - excitations , are given and proposals are made for generating them by combining the scheme with others . finally , effects of realistic photocounting and fock - state preparation are discussed .
