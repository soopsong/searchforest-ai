we study the conjectured holographic duality between entanglement of purification and the entanglement wedge cross - section . we generalize both quantities and prove several information theoretic inequalities involving them . these include upper bounds on conditional mutual information and tripartite information , as well as a lower bound for tripartite information . these inequalities are proven both holographically and for general quantum states . in addition , we use the cyclic entropy inequalities to derive a new holographic inequality for the entanglement wedge cross - section , and provide numerical evidence that the corresponding inequality for the entanglement of purification may be true in general . finally , we use intuition from bit threads to extend the conjecture to holographic duals of suboptimal purifications .
