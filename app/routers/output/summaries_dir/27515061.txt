when quantum teleportation is performed with truly identical massive particles , indistinguishability allows us to teleport addressable degrees of freedom which do not identify particles , but e.g. orthogonal modes . the key resource of the protocol is a state of entangled modes , but the conservation of the total number of particles does not allow for perfect deterministic teleportation unless the number of particles in the resource state goes to infinity . here , we study the convergence of teleportation performances in the above limit , and provide sufficient conditions for asymptotic perfect teleporation . we also apply these conditions to the case of resource states affected by noise .
