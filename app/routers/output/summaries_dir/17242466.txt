fourier states are multi - qubit registers that facilitate phase rotations in fault - tolerant quantum computing . we propose distillation protocols for constructing the fundamental , $ n$-qubit fourier state with error $ o(2^{-n})$ at a cost of $ o(n \log n)$ toffoli gates and clifford gates , or any arbitrary fourier state using $ o(n^2)$ gates . we analyze these protocols with methods from digital signal processing . these results suggest that phase kickback , which uses fourier states , could be the current lowest - overhead method for generating arbitrary phase rotations .
