we present a mathematica package , qswalk , to simulate the time evaluation of quantum stochastic walks ( qsws ) on arbitrary directed and weighted graphs . qsws are a generalization of continuous time quantum walks that incorporate both coherent and incoherent dynamics and as such , include both quantum walks and classical random walks as special cases . the incoherent component allows for quantum walks along directed graph edges . the dynamics of qsws are expressed using the lindblad formalism , originally developed for open quantum systems , which frames the problem in the language of density matrices . for a qsw on a graph of $ n$ vertices , we have a sparse superoperator in an $ n^2$-dimensional space , which can be solved efficiently using the built - in matrixexp function in mathematica . we illustrate the use of the qswalk package through several example case studies .
