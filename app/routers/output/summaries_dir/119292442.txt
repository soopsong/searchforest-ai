we derive the statistics of scattered photons from a $ \lambda$- or ladder - type three - level emitter ( 3le ) embedded in a 1d open waveguide . the weak probe photons in the waveguide are coupled to one of the two allowed transitions of the 3le , and the other transition is driven by a control beam . this system shows electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) which is accompanied with the autler - townes splitting ( ats ) at a strong driving by the control beam , and some of these effects have been observed recently . we show that the nature of second - order coherence of the transmitted probe photons near two - photon resonance changes from bunching to antibunching to constant as strength of the control beam is ramped up from zero to a higher value where the ats appears .
