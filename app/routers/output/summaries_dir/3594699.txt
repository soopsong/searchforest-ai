we study the cooperative optical coupling between regularly spaced atoms in a one - dimensional waveguide using decompositions to subradiant and superradiant collective excitation eigenmodes , direct numerical solutions , and analytical transfer - matrix methods . we illustrate how the spectrum of transmitted light through the waveguide including the emergence of narrow fano resonances can be understood by the resonance features of the eigenmodes . we describe a method based on superradiant and subradiant modes to engineer the optical response of the waveguide and to store light . the stopping of light is obtained by transferring an atomic excitation to a subradiant collective mode with the zero radiative resonance linewidth by controlling the level shift of an atom in the waveguide . moreover , we obtain an exact analytic solution for the transmitted light through the waveguide for the case of a regular lattice of atoms and provide a simple description how the light transmission may present large resonance shifts when the lattice spacing is close , but not exactly equal , to half of the wavelength of the light . experimental imperfections such as fluctuations of the positions of the atoms and loss of light from the waveguide are easily quantified in the numerical simulations , which produce the natural result that the optical response of the atomic array tends toward the response of a gas with random atomic positions .
