we introduce a family of discrete - time quantum walks , called two - partition model , based on two equivalence - class partitions of the computational basis , which establish the notion of local dynamics . this family encompasses most versions of unitary discrete - time quantum walks driven by two local operators studied in literature , such as the coined model , szegedy 's model , and the 2-tessellable staggered model . we also analyze the connection of those models with the two - step coined model , which is driven by the square of the evolution operator of the standard discrete - time coined walk . we prove formally that the two - step coined model , an extension of szegedy model for multigraphs , and the two - tessellable staggered model are unitarily equivalent . then , selecting one specific model among those families is a matter of taste not generality .
