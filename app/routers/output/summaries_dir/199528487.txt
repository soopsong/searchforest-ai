the entropy of a quantum operation , defined as the von neumann entropy of the corresponding choi - jamio{\l}kowski state , characterizes the coupling of the principal system with the environment . for any quantum channel $ \phi$ acting on a state of size $ n$ one defines the complementary channel $ \tilde \phi$ , which sends the input state into the state of the environment after the operation . making use of subadditivity of entropy we show that for any dimension $ n$ the sum of both entropies , $ s(\phi)+ s(\tilde \phi)$ , is bounded from below . this result characterizes the trade - off between the information on the initial quantum state accessible to the principal system and the information leaking to the environment . for one qubit maps , $ n=2 $ , we describe the interpolating family of depolarising maps , for which the sum of both entropies gives the lower boundary of the region allowed in the space spanned by both entropies .
