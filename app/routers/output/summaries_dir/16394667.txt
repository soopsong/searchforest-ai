there are a number of important thought experiments that involve raising and lowering boxes full of radiation in the vicinity of black hole horizons . this paper looks at the limitations placed on these thought experiments by the null energy condition , which imposes a fundamental bound on the tensile - strength - to - weight ratio of the materials involved , makes it impossible to build a box near the horizon that is wider than a single wavelength of the hawking quanta and puts a severe constraint on the operation of ' space elevators ' near black holes . in particular , it is shown that proposals for mining black holes by lowering boxes near the horizon , collecting some hawking radiation and dragging it out to infinity can not proceed nearly as rapidly as has previously been claimed and that as a consequence of this limitation the boxes and all the moving parts are superfluous and black holes can be destroyed equally rapidly by threading the horizon with strings .
