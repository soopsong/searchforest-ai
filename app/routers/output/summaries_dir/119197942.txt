we extend the recent result of bipartite bell singlet [ carr and saffman , phys . rev . lett . { \bf111 } , ( 2013 ) ] to a stationary three - dimensional entanglement between two - individual neutral rydberg atoms . this proposal makes full use of the coherent dynamics provided by rydberg mediated interaction and the dissipative factor originating from the spontaneous emission of rydberg state . the numerical simulation of the master equation reveals that both the target state negativity $ { \cal n}(\hat\rho_{\infty})$ and fidelity $ { \cal f}(\hat\rho_{\infty})$ can exceed 99.90 % . furthermore , a steady three - atom singlet state $ |s_3\rangle$ is also achievable based on the same mechanism .
