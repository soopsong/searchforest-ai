this paper reconsiders the claimed rapidity of a scheme for the purification of the quantum state of a qubit , proposed recently in jacobs 2003 phys . rev . a67 030301(r ) . the qubit starts in a completely mixed state , and information is obtained by a continuous measurement . jacobs ' rapid purification protocol uses hamiltonian feedback control to maximise the average purity of the qubit for a given time , with a factor of two increase in the purification rate over the no - feedback protocol . however , by re - examining the latter approach , we show that it mininises the average time taken for a qubit to reach a given purity . in fact , the average time taken for the no - feedback protocol beats that for jacobs ' protocol by a factor of two . we discuss how this is compatible with jacobs ' result , and the usefulness of the different approaches .
