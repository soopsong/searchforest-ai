a key issue in developing pendular fabry - perot interferometers as very accurate displacement measurement devices , is the noise level . the fabry - perot pendulums are the most promising device to detect gravitational waves , and therefore the background and the internal noise should be accurately measured and reduced . in fact terminal masses generates additional internal noise mainly due to thermal fluctuations and vibrations . we propose to exploit the reflectivity change , that occurs in some special points , to monitor the pendulums free oscillations and possibly estimate the noise level . we find that in spite of long transients , it is an effective method for noise estimate . we also prove that to only retain the sequence of escapes , rather than the whole time dependent dynamics , entails the main characteristics of the phenomenon . escape times could also be relevant for future gravitational wave detector developments .
