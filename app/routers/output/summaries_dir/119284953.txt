we study single photon optomechanics conditioned on photon counting events . by selecting only detection events that occur long after a photon pulse arrives at the cavity , the optomechanical interaction time can be increased , allowing a large momentum kick to be applied to the oscillator . we apply this to two optomechanical cavities set up within a mach - zhender interferometer driven by a single photon source . the conditional state of the mechanical modes in such a system becomes an entangled cat state for detection times resulting in maximum mechanical amplitude in phase space . further we study the dynamics induced by a second photon pulse injected into an already conditioned optomechanical cavity , a quarter of a mechanical period after the first photon has been detected . we illustrate how the optomechanical interaction resulting from the second photon can be strongly suppressed allowing conditional optomechanical routing of single photons with single photon control pulses .
