we implement superconducting ybco planar resonators with two fundamental modes for circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments . we first demonstrate good tunability in the resonant microwave frequencies and in their interplay as it emerges from the dependence of the transmission spectra on the device geometry . we then investigate the magnetic coupling of the resonant modes with bulk samples of dpph organic radical spins . the transmission spectroscopies performed at low temperature show that the coherent spin - photon coupling regime with the spin ensembles can be achieved by each of the resonator modes . the analysis of the results within the framework of the input - output formalism and by means of entropic measures demonstrates coherent mixing of the degrees of freedom corresponding to two remote spin ensembles and , with a suitable choice of the geometry , the approaching of a regime with spin - induced mixing of the two photon modes .
