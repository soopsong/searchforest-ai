we investigate the possibility to achieve scalable photonic quantum computing by the giant optical circular birefringence induced by a quantum - dot spin in a double - sided optical microcavity as a result of cavity quantum electrodynamics . we construct a deterministic controlled - not gate on two photonic qubits by two single - photon input - output processes and the readout on an electron - medium spin confined in an optical resonant microcavity . this idea could be applied to multi - qubit gates on photonic qubits and we give the quantum circuit for a three - photon toffoli gate . high fidelities and high efficiencies could be achieved when the side leakage to the cavity loss rate is low . it is worth pointing out that our devices work in both the strong and the weak coupling regimes .
