we investigate the theoretical limits of the effect of the quantum interaction distance on the speed of exact quantum addition circuits . for this study , we exploit graph embedding for quantum circuit analysis . we study a logical mapping of qubits and gates of any $ \omega(\log n)$-depth quantum adder circuit for two $ n$-qubit registers onto a practical architecture , which limits interaction distance to the nearest neighbors only and supports only one- and two - qubit logical gates . unfortunately , on the chosen $ k$-dimensional practical architecture , we prove that the depth lower bound of any exact quantum addition circuits is no longer $ \omega(\log { n})$ , but $ \omega(\sqrt[k]{n})$. this result , the first application of graph embedding to quantum circuits and devices , provides a new tool for compiler development , emphasizes the impact of quantum computer architecture on performance , and acts as a cautionary note when evaluating the time performance of quantum algorithms .
