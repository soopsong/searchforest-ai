experiments performed within the last year have demonstrated rydberg state mediated quantum gates and deterministic entanglement between pairs of trapped neutral atoms . these experiments validate ten year old proposals for rydberg mediated quantum logic , but are only the beginning of ongoing efforts to improve the fidelity of the results obtained and scale the experiments to larger numbers of qubits . we present here a summary of the results to date , along with a critical evaluation of the prospects for higher fidelity rydberg gates .
