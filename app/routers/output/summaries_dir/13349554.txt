a quantum communication channel can be put to many uses : it can transmit classical information , private classical information , or quantum information . it can be used alone , with shared entanglement , or together with other channels . for each of these settings there is a capacity that quantifies a channel 's potential for communication . in this short review , i summarize what is known about the various capacities of a quantum channel , including a discussion of the relevant additivity questions . i also give some indication of potentially interesting directions for future research .
