quantum computers are expected to be more efficient in performing certain computations than any classical machine . unfortunately , the technological challenges associated with building a full - scale quantum computer have not yet allowed the experimental verification of such an expectation . recently , boson sampling has emerged as a problem that is suspected to be intractable on any classical computer , but efficiently implementable with a linear quantum optical setup . therefore , boson sampling may offer an experimentally realizable challenge to the extended church - turing thesis and this remarkable possibility motivated much of the interest around boson sampling , at least in relation to complexity - theoretic questions . in this work , we show that the successful development of a boson sampling apparatus would not only answer such inquiries , but also yield a practical tool for difficult molecular computations . specifically , we show that a boson sampling device with a modified input state can be used to generate molecular vibronic spectra , including complicated effects such as duschinsky rotations .
