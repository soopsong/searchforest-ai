we give a generalization to an infinite tree geometry of vidal 's infinite time - evolving block decimation ( itebd ) algorithm for simulating an infinite line of quantum spins . we numerically investigate the quantum ising model in a transverse field on the bethe lattice using the matrix product state ansatz . we observe a second order phase transition , with certain key differences from the transverse field ising model on an infinite spin chain . we also investigate a transverse field ising model with a specific longitudinal field . when the transverse field is turned off , this model has a highly degenerate ground state as opposed to the pure ising model whose ground state is only doubly degenerate .
