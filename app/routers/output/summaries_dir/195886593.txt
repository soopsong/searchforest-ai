the generation and manipulation of hybrid entanglement of light involving discrete- and continuous - variable states have recently appeared as essential resources towards the realization of heterogeneous quantum networks . here we investigate a scheme for the remote generation of hybrid entanglement between particle - like and wave - like optical qubits based on a non - local heralding photon detection . we also extend this scheme with additional local or non - local detections . an additional local heralding allows the resulting state to exhibit a higher fidelity with the targeted entangled qubits while a two - photon non - local heralding detection gives access to a higher dimensionality in the discrete - variable subspace , resulting thereby in the generation of hybrid entangled qutrits . the implementation of the presented schemes , in combination with ongoing works on high - fidelity quantum state engineering , will provide novel non - classical light sources for the development of optical hybrid architectures .
