for the case of phase damping ( pure decoherence ) we investigate the extent to which environmental traits are imprinted on an open quantum system . the dynamics is described using the quantum channel approach . we study what the knowledge of the channel may reveal about the nature of its underlying dynamics and , conversely , what the dynamics tells us about how to consistently model the environment . we find that for a markov phase - damping channel , that is , a channel compatible with a time - continuous markovian evolution , the environment may adequately be represented by a mixture of only a few coherent states . for arbitrary hilbert space dimension $ n\geq 4 $ we refine the idea of { \it quantum phase damping } , of which we show a means of identification . symmetry considerations are used to identify decoherence - free subspaces of the system .
