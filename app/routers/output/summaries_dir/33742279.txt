in this note , we propose an extension of the wasserstein 1-metric ( $ w_1 $ ) for matrix probability densities , matrix - valued density measures , and an unbalanced interpretation of mass transport . the key is using duality theory , in particular , a"dual of the dual"formulation of $ w_1$. this matrix analogue of the earth mover 's distance has several attractive features including ease of computation .
