non - local correlations are among the most fascinating features of quantum theory from the point of view of information : such correlations , although not allowing for signaling , are unexplainable by pre - shared information . the correlations have applications in cryptography , communication complexity , and sit at the very heart of many attempts of understanding quantum theory -- and its limits -- in terms of classical information . in these contexts , the question is crucial whether such correlations can be amplified or distilled , i.e. , whether and how weak correlations can be used for generating ( a smaller amount of ) stronger . whereas the question has been studied quite extensively for bipartite correlations ( yielding both pessimistic and optimistic results ) , only little is known in the multi - partite case . we introduce a general framework of reductions between multi - party input - output systems . within this formalism , we show that a natural n - party generalization of the well - known popescu - rohrlich box can be distilled , by an adaptive protocol , to the algebraic maximum.we use this result further to show that a much broader class of correlations , including all purely threepartite correlations , can be distilled from arbitrarily weak to almost maximal strength with partial communication , i.e. , using only a subset of the channels required for the creation of the same correlation from scratch . alternatively , this means that arbitrarily weak non - local correlations can have a"communication value"in the context of the generation of maximal non - locality .
