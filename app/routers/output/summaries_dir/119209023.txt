we propose a non - hermitian generalization of stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) , which allows one to increase speed and fidelity of the adiabatic passage . this is done by adding balanced imaginary ( gain / loss ) terms in the diagonal ( bare energy ) terms of the hamiltonian and choosing them such that they cancel exactly the nonadiabatic couplings , providing in this way an effective shortcut to adiabaticity . remarkably , for a stirap using delayed gaussian - shaped pulses in the counter - intuitive scheme the imaginary terms of the hamiltonian turn out to be time independent . a possible physical realization of non - hermitian stirap , based on light transfer in three evanescently - coupled optical waveguides , is proposed .
