traditional quantum error correction involves the redundant encoding of k quantum bits using n quantum bits to allow the detection and correction of any t bit error . the smallest general t=1 code requires n=5 for k=1 . however , the dominant error process in a physical system is often well known , thus inviting the question : given a specific error model , can more efficient codes be devised ? we demonstrate new codes which correct just amplitude damping errors which allow , for example , a t=1 , k=1 code using effectively n=4.6 . our scheme is based on using bosonic states of photons in a finite number of optical modes . we present necessary and sufficient conditions for the codes , and describe construction algorithms , physical implementation , and performance bounds .
