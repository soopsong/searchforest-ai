when a quantum system is coupled to several heat baths at different temperatures , it eventually reaches a non - equilibrium steady state featuring stationary internal heat currents . these currents imply that entropy is continually being produced in the system at a constant rate . in this paper we apply phase - space techniques to the calculation of the wigner entropy production on general linear networks of harmonic nodes . working in the ubiquitous limit of weak internal coupling and weak dissipation , we obtain simple closed - form expressions for the entropic contribution of each individual quasi - probability current . our analysis highlights the essential role played by the internal unitary interactions ( node - node couplings ) in maintaining a non - equilibrium steady - state and hence a finite entropy production rate . we also apply this formalism to the paradigmatic problem of energy transfer through a chain of oscillators subject to self - consistent internal baths that can be used to tune the transport from ballistic to diffusive . we find that the entropy production scales with different power law behaviors in the ballistic and diffusive regimes , hence allowing us to quantify what is the"entropic cost of diffusivity .
