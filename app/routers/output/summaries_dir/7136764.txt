we extend the notion of memristive systems to capacitive and inductive elements , namely capacitors and inductors whose properties depend on the state and history of the system . all these elements show pinched hysteretic loops in the two constitutive variables that define them : current - voltage for the memristor , charge - voltage for the memcapacitor , and current - flux for the meminductor . we argue that these devices are common at the nanoscale where the dynamical properties of electrons and ions are likely to depend on the history of the system , at least within certain time scales . these elements and their combination in circuits open up new functionalities in electronics and they are likely to find applications in neuromorphic devices to simulate learning , adaptive and spontaneous behavior .
