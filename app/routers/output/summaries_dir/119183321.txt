recently , almheiri , marolf , polchinski , and sully found that for a sufficiently old black hole ( bh ) , the set of assumptions known as the \emph{complementarity postulates } appears to be inconsistent with the assumption of local regularity at the horizon . they concluded that the horizon of an old bh is likely to be the locus of local irregularity , a"firewall " . here i point out that if one adopts a different assumption , namely that semiclassical physics holds throughout its anticipated domain of validity , then no inconsistency seems to arise , and the horizon retains its regularity . in this alternative view - point , the vast portion of the original bh information remains trapped inside the bh throughout the semiclassical domain of evaporation , and possibly leaks out later on . this appears to be an inevitable outcome of semiclassical gravity .
