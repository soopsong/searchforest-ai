quantum algorithm is an algorithm for solving mathematical problems using quantum systems encoded as information , which is found to outperform classical algorithms in some specific cases . the objective of this study is to develop a quantum algorithm for finding the roots of nth degree polynomials where n is any positive integer . in classical algorithm , the resources required for solving this problem increase drastically when n increases and it would be impossible to practically solve the problem when n is large . it was found that any polynomial can be rearranged into a corresponding companion matrix , whose eigenvalues are roots of the polynomial . this leads to a possibility to perform a quantum algorithm where the number of computational resources increase as a polynomial of n. in this study , we construct a quantum circuit representing the companion matrix and use eigenvalue estimation technique to find roots of polynomial .
