universal quantum computation using photonic systems requires gates whose hamiltonians are of order greater than quadratic in the quadrature operators . we first review previous proposals to implement such gates , where specific non - gaussian states are used as resources in conjunction with entangling gates such as the continuous - variable versions of c - phase and c - not gates . we then propose on states which are superpositions of the vacuum and the $ n^{th}$ fock state , for use as non - gaussian resource states . we show that on states can be used to implement the cubic and higher - order quadrature phase gates to first order in gate strength . there are several advantages to this method such as reduced number of superpositions in the resource state preparation and greater control over the final gate . we also introduce useful figures of merit to characterize gate performance . utilising a supply of on - demand resource states one can potentially scale up implementation to greater accuracy , by repeated application of the basic circuit .
