we develop and present an improvement to the conventional technique for solving the hierarchical equations of motion which reduces the memory cost by more than 75 % while retaining the same convergence rate and accuracy . this allows for a full calculation of the population dynamics of the 24-site fmo trimer for long timescales with very little effort , and we present the first fully converged , exact results for the 7-site subsystem of the monomer , and for the full 24-site trimer . owing to this new approach , our numerically exact 24-site , 2-exponential results are the most demanding heom calculations performed to date , surpassing the 50-site , 1-exponential results of strumpfer and schulten [ 2012 , j. chem . thy.&comp . , 8 , 2808 ] . we then show where our exact 7-site results deviate from the approximation of ishizaki and fleming [ 2009 , proc . natl . acad . sci . usa , 106 , 17255 ] . our exact results are then compared to calculations using the incoherent forster theory , and it is found that the energy transfer from the antenna to the reaction center occurs more than 50 times faster than the fluorescence lifetime of the excitation , whether or not coherence is considered . this means that coherence is not likely to improve the efficiency of the photosynthesis . in fact , the incoherent theory often tends to over - predict the rates of energy transfer , suggesting that in some cases electronic coherence may actually slow down the photosynthetic process .
