max - plus algebra is a kind of idempotent semiring over $ \mathbb{r}_{\max}:=\mathbb{r}\cup\{-\infty\}$ with two operations $ \oplus : = \max$ and $ \otimes : = + $ .in this paper , we introduce a new model of a walk on one dimensional lattice on $ \mathbb{z}$ , as an analogue of the quantum walk , over the max - plus algebra and we call it max - plus walk . in the conventional quantum walk , the summation of the $ \ell^2$-norm of the states over all the positions is a conserved quantity.in contrast , the summation of eigenvalues of state decision matrices is a conserved quantity in the max - plus walk.moreover , spectral analysis on the total time evolution operator is also given .
