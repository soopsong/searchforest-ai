in this paper , we analyze the performance of randomized benchmarking protocols on gate sets under a variety of realistic error models that include systematic rotations , amplitude damping , leakage to higher levels , and 1 / f noise . we find that , in almost all cases , benchmarking provides better than a factor - of - two estimate of average error rate , suggesting that randomized benchmarking protocols are a valuable tool for verification and validation of quantum operations . in addition , we derive new models for fidelity decay curves under certain types of non - markovian noise models such as 1 / f and leakage errors . we also show that , provided the standard error of the fidelity measurements is small , only a small number of trials are required for high confidence estimation of gate errors .
