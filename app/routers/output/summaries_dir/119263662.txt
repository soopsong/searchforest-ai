we consider the d1d5 cft near the orbifold point and develop methods for computing the mixing of untwisted operators to first order by using the ope on the covering surface . we argue that the ope on the cover encodes both the structure constants for the orbifold cft and the explicit form of the mixing operators . we show this explicitly for some example operators . we start by considering a family of operators dual to supergravity modes , and show that the ope implies that there is no shift in the anomalous dimension to first order , as expected . we specialize to the operator dual to the dilaton , and show that the leading order singularity in the ope reproduces the correct structure constant . finally , we consider an unprotected operator of conformal dimension ( 2,2 ) , and show that the leading order singularity and one of the subleading singularies both reproduce the correct structure constant . we check that the operator produced at subleading order using the ope method is correct by calculating a number of three point functions using a mathematica package we developed . further development of this ope technique should lead to more efficient calculations for the d1d5 cft perturbed away from the orbifold point .
