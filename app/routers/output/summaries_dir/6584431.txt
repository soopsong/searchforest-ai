non - reciprocal devices , which have different transmission coefficients for propagating waves in opposite directions , are crucial components in many low noise quantum measurements . in most schemes , magneto - optical effects provide the necessary non - reciprocity . in contrast , the proof - of - principle device presented here , consists of two on - chip coupled josephson parametric converters ( jpcs ) , which achieves directionality by exploiting the non - reciprocal phase response of the jpc in the trans - gain mode . the non - reciprocity of the device is controlled in - situ by varying the amplitude and phase difference of two independent microwave pump tones feeding the system . at the desired working point and for a signal frequency of 8.453 ghz , the device achieves a forward power gain of 15 db within a dynamical bandwidth of 9 mhz , a reverse gain of -6 db and suppression of the reflected signal by 8 db . we also find that the amplifier adds a noise equivalent to less than one and a half photons at the signal frequency ( referred to the input ) . it can process up to 3 photons at the signal frequency per inverse dynamical bandwidth . with a directional amplifier operating along the principles of this device , qubit and readout preamplifier could be integrated on the same chip .
