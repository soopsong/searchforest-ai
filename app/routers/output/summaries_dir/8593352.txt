we consider the propagation of a classical electromagnetic wave through a transmission line , formed by identical superconducting charge qubits inside a superconducting resonator . since the qubits can be in a coherent superposition of quantum states , we show that such a system demonstrates interesting new effects , such as a ` ` breathing ' ' photonic crystal with an oscillating bandgap , and a ` ` quantum archimedean screw ' ' that transports , at an arbitrary controlled velocity , josephson plasma waves through the transmission line . the key ingredient of these effects is that the optical properties of the josephson transmission line are controlled by the quantum coherent state of the qubits .
