we propose a resource - efficient error - rejecting entangled - state analyzer for polarization - encoded multiphoton systems . the analyzer works in a passive way and can completely distinguish $ 2^n$ greenberger - horne - zeilinger~(ghz ) states of $ n$ photons without using any active operation or fast switching . the efficiency and fidelity of the ghz - state analysis can , in principle , be close to unity , when an ideal single - photon scattering condition is fulfilled . for a non - ideal scattering , which typically reduces the fidelity of a ghz - state analysis , we introduce a passively error - rejecting circuit to enable a near - perfect fidelity at the expense of a slight decrease of its efficiency . furthermore , the protocol can be directly used to perform a two - photon bell - state analysis . this passive , resource - efficient , and error - rejecting protocol can , therefore , be useful for practical quantum networks .
