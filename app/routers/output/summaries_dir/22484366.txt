the transport of sound and heat , in the form of phonons , can be limited by disorder - induced scattering . in electronic and optical settings the introduction of chiral transport , in which carrier propagation exhibits parity asymmetry , can remove elastic backscattering and provides robustness against disorder . however , suppression of disorder - induced scattering has never been demonstrated in non - topological phononic systems . here we experimentally demonstrate a path for achieving robust phonon transport in the presence of material disorder , by explicitly inducing chirality through parity - selective optomechanical coupling . we show that asymmetric optical pumping of a symmetric resonator enables a dramatic chiral cooling of clockwise and counterclockwise phonons , while simultaneously suppressing the hidden action of disorder . surprisingly , this passive mechanism is also accompanied by a chiral reduction in heat load leading to optical cooling of the mechanics without added damping , an effect that has no optical analogue . this technique can potentially improve upon the fundamental thermal limits of resonant mechanical sensors , which can not be attained through sideband cooling .
