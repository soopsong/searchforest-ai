linear combination of unitaries ( lcu for short ) is one of the most important techniques in designing quantum algorithms . in this paper , we propose a new quantum algorithm in three different forms to achieve lcu . different from previous algorithms [ childs - linear - system , clader , long11 ] , the complexity now only depends on the number of the unitaries and the precision . so it will play more important role in the design of quantum algorithms when the number of unitaries is small , such as quantum iteration algorithms . % since in iteration algorithms , $ m$ often refers to the iteration steps , which is small if the iteration algorithms are efficient . moreover , as an application of the new lcu , three new quantum algorithms to the searching problem will be proposed , which will provide us new insights into grover 's searching algorithm . we also show that the problem of lcu is closely related to the problem of if we can efficiently implement $ u^t$ for $ 0 < t<1 $ when $ u$ is an efficiently implemented unitary operator ? this problem is not hard to solve . however , it becomes inefficient when it contains a strict requirement on precision , such as in grover 's algorithm . finally , as an application of the new lcu technique , we will show that the quantum state of any real classical vector can be prepared efficiently in quantum computer . so this solves the"input problem"in quantum computer efficiently .
