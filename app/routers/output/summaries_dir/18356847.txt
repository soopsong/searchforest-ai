we discuss a method to adapt the codeword stabilized ( cws ) quantum code framework to the problem of finding asymmetric quantum codes . we focus on the corresponding pauli error models for amplitude damping noise and phase damping noise . in particular , we look at codes for pauli error models that correct one or two amplitude damping errors . applying local clifford operations on graph states , we are able to exhaustively search for all possible codes up to length $ 9$. with a similar method , we also look at codes for the pauli error model that detect a single amplitude error and detect multiple phase damping errors . many new codes with good parameters are found , including nonadditive codes and degenerate codes .
