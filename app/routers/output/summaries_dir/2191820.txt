in this paper , we investigate the performance analysis and synthesis of distributed system throttlers ( dst ) . a throttler is a mechanism that limits the flow rate of incoming metrics , e.g. , byte per second , network bandwidth usage , capacity , traffic , etc . this can be used to protect a service 's backend / clients from getting overloaded , or to reduce the effects of uncertainties in demand for shared services . we study performance deterioration of dsts subject to demand uncertainty . we then consider network synthesis problems that aim to improve the performance of noisy dsts via communication link modifications as well as server update cycle modifications .
