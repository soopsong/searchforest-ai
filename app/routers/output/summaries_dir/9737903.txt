the availability of a universal quantum computer will have fundamental impact on a vast number of research fields and society as a whole . an increasingly large scientific and industrial community is working towards the realization of such a device . an arbitrarily large quantum computer is best constructed using a modular approach . we present a blueprint for a trapped - ion based scalable quantum computer module which makes it possible to create a scalable quantum computer architecture based on long - wavelength radiation quantum gates . the modules control all operations as stand - alone units , are constructed using silicon microfabrication techniques and they are within reach of current technology . to perform the required quantum computations , the modules make use of long - wavelength - radiation based quantum gate technology . to scale this microwave quantum computer architecture to an arbitrary size we present a fully scalable design that makes use of ion transport between different modules , thereby allowing arbitrarily many modules to be connected to construct a large - scale device . a high - error - threshold surface error correction code can be implemented in the proposed architecture to execute fault - tolerant operations . with only minor adjustments the proposed modules are also suitable for alternative trapped - ion quantum computer architectures , such as schemes using photonic interconnects .
