interferometry with quantum light is known to provide enhanced precision for estimating a single phase . however , depending on the parameters involved , the quantum limit for the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters may not attainable , leading to trade - offs in the attainable precisions . here we study the simultaneous estimation of two parameters related to optical interferometry : phase and loss , using a fixed number of photons . we derive a trade - off in the estimation of these two parameters which shows that , in contrast to single - parameter estimation , it is impossible to design a strategy saturating the quantum cramer - rao bound for loss and phase estimation in a single setup simultaneously . we design optimal quantum states with a fixed number of photons achieving the best possible simultaneous precisions . our results reveal general features about concurrently estimating hamiltonian and dissipative parameters , and has implications for sophisticated sensing scenarios such as quantum imaging .
