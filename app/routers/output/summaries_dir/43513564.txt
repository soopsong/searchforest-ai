fermionic linear optics is a limited form of quantum computation which is known to be efficiently simulable on a classical computer . we revisit and extend this result by enlarging the set of available computational gates : in addition to unitaries and measurements , we allow dissipative evolution governed by a markovian master equation with linear lindblad operators . we show that this more general form of fermionic computation is also simulable efficiently by classical means . given a system of $ n$ fermionic modes , our algorithm simulates any such gate in time $ o(n^3)$ while a single - mode measurement is simulated in time $ o(n^2)$. the steady state of the lindblad equation can be computed in time $ o(n^3)$.
