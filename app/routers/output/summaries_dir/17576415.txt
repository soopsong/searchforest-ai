a quantum channel physically is a unitary interaction between the information carrying system and an environment , which is initialized in a pure state before the interaction . conventionally , this state , as also the parameters of the interaction , is assumed to be fixed and known to the sender and receiver . here , following the model introduced by us earlier [ karumanchi et al . , arxiv[quant - ph]:1407.8160 ] , we consider a benevolent third party , i.e. a helper , controlling the environment state , and how the helper 's presence changes the communication game . in particular , we define and study the classical capacity of a unitary interaction with helper , indeed two variants , one where the helper can only prepare separable states across many channel uses , and one without this restriction . furthermore , the two even more powerful scenarios of pre - shared entanglement between helper and receiver , and of classical communication between sender and helper ( making them conferencing encoders ) are considered .
