we study the frequency splitting of the polarization eigenmodes of the fundamental transverse mode in co2 laser - machined , high - finesse optical fabry - perot cavities and investigate the influence of the geometry of the cavity mirrors . their highly reflective surfaces are typically not rotationally symmetric but have slightly different radii of curvature along two principal axes . we observe that the eccentricity of such elliptical mirrors lifts the degeneracy of the polarization eigenmodes . the impact of the eccentricity increases for smaller radii of curvature . a model derived from corrections to the paraxial resonator theory is in excellent agreement with the measurements , showing that geometric effects are the main source of the frequency splitting of polarization modes for the type of microscopic cavity studied here . by rotating one of the mirrors around the cavity axis , the splitting can be tuned . in the case of an identical differential phase shift per mirror , it can even be eliminated , despite a nonvanishing eccentricity of each mirror . we expect our results to have important implications for many experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics , where fabry - perot cavities with small mode volumes are required .
