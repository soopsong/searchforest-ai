we propose to exploit the quantum properties of nonlinear media to estimate the parameters of massless wormholes . the spacetime curvature produces a change in length with respect to minkowski spacetime that can be estimated in principle with an interferometer . we use quantum metrology techniques to show that the sensitivity is improved with nonlinear media and propose a nonlinear mach - zehnder interferometer to estimate the parameters of massless wormholes that scales beyond the heisenberg limit .
