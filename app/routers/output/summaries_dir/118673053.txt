although people have already artificially formed parity -- time ( $ \mathcal{pt}$ ) symmetry with gain and loss in a balanced manner , it is still a defect that the gain is restricted to semi -- classical but not full quantum . here we propose and analyze a theoretical scheme to realize full quantum oscillator $ \mathcal{pt}$--symmetry . the quantum gain is provided by a dissipation optical cavity with blue detuned laser field . after adiabatically eliminating the cavity modes , we give an effective master equation , which is a more complete quantum description compared with non -- hermitian hamiltonian , to reveal the quantum behaviors of such a gain oscillator . this kind of $ \mathcal{pt}$--symmetry can eliminate the dissipation effect in quantum regime . as examples , we finally apply $ \mathcal{pt}$--symmetric oscillators to enhance optomechanically induced transparency and to preserve oscillator non -- classical state .
