thermoelectric transport involving an arbitrary number of terminals is discussed in the presence of a magnetic field breaking time - reversal symmetry within the linear response regime using the landauer - b\"uttiker formalism . we derive a universal bound on the onsager coefficients that depends only on the number of terminals . this bound implies bounds on the efficiency and on efficiency at maximum power for heat engines and refrigerators . for isothermal engines pumping particles and for absorption refrigerators these bounds become independent even of the number of terminals . on a technical level , these results follow from an original algebraic analysis of the asymmetry index of doubly substochastic matrices and their schur complements .
