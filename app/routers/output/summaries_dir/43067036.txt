we consider two entangled accelerating qubits coupled with real scalar fields , each described by the unruh - wald model . it is demonstrated that because of the unruh effect , the bipartite entanglement of the two qubits suddenly dies when the acceleration of one or more qubits are large enough . we also consider three entangled accelerating qubits in ghz state and in w state , with equal acceleration - frequency ratio , and found that in either state , the tripartite entanglement suddenly dies at a certain value of acceleration - frequency ratio . the equivalence between the rindler metric and the schwarzchild metric in the vicinity of the horizon of a black hole implies that for the two entangled qubits outside a black hole , the entanglement suddenly dies when one or both of the qubits are close enough to the horizon , while for the three entangled qubits in ghz or w state , the tripartite entanglement suddenly dies when these qubits are close enough to the horizon .
