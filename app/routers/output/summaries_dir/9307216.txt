different from the previous works on generating entangled states , this work is focused on how to transfer the prepared entangled states onto memory qubits for protecting them against decoherence . we here consider a physical system consisting of $ n$ operation qubits and $ 2n$ memory qubits placed in a cavity or coupled to a resonator . a method is presented for transferring $ n$-qubit greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) entangled states from the operation qubits ( i.e. , information processing cells ) onto the memory qubits ( i.e. , information memory elements with long decoherence time ) . the transferred ghz states are encoded in a decoherence - free subspace against collective dephasing , and thus can be immune from decoherence induced by a dephasing environment . in addition , the state transfer procedure has nothing to do with the number of qubits , the operation time does not increase with the number of qubits , and no measurement is needed for the state transfer . this proposal can be applied to a wide range of hybrid qubits such as natural atoms and artificial atoms ( e.g. , various solid - state qubits ) .
