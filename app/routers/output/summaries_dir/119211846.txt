in yang et al . 's literatures ( j. phys . a : math . 42 , 055305 , 2009 ; j. phys . a : math . 43 , 209801 , 2010 ) , a quantum private comparison protocol based on bell states and hash function is proposed , which aims to securely compare the equality of two participants ' information with the help of a dishonest third party ( tp ) . however , this study will point out their protocol can not resist a special kind of attack , tp 's same initial states attack , which is presented in this paper . that is , the dishonest tp can disturb the comparison result without being detected through preparing the same initial states . finally , a simple improvement is given to avoid the attack .
