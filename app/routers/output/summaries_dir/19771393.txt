we present a novel type of three - dimensional dark focus optical trapping potential for ultra - cold atoms and bose - einstein condensates . this ' optical bottle ' is created with blue - detuned laser light exploiting the phenomenon of conical refraction occurring in biaxial crystals . we present experiments on confining a rb87 bose - einstein condensate in this potential and derive the trapping frequencies and potential barriers under the harmonic approximation and the conical refraction theory .
