self - calibrating quantum state tomography aims at reconstructing the unknown quantum state and certain properties of the measurement devices from the same data . since the estimates of the state and device parameters come from the same data , one should employ a joint estimation scheme , including the construction and reporting of joint state - device error regions to quantify uncertainty . we explain how to do this naturally within the framework of optimal error regions . as an illustrative example , we apply our procedure to the double - crosshair measurement of the bb84 scenario in quantum cryptography and so reconstruct the state and estimate the detection efficiencies simultaneously and reliably . we also discuss the practical situation of a satellite - based quantum key distribution scheme , for which self - calibration and proper treatment of the data are necessities .
