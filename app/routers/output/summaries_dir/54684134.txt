standard randomized benchmarking protocols entail sampling from a unitary 2 design , which is not always practical . in this article we examine randomized benchmarking protocols based on subgroups of the clifford group that are not unitary 2 designs . we introduce a general method for analyzing such protocols and subsequently apply it to two subgroups , the group generated by controlled - not , hadamard , and pauli gates and that generated by only controlled - not and pauli gates . in both cases the error probability can be estimated to within a factor of two or less where the factor can be arranged to be conservative and to decay exponentially in the number of qubits . for randomized benchmarking of logical qubits even better accuracy will typically be obtained . thus , we show that sampling a distribution which is close to a unitary 2 design , although sufficient , is not necessary for randomized benchmarking to high accuracy .
