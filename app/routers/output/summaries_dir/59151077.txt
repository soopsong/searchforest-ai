we compute the entropy of entanglement of two blocks of l spins at a distance d in the ground state of an ising chain in an external transverse magnetic field . we numerically study the von neumann entropy for different values of the transverse field . at the critical point we obtain analytical results for blocks of size l=1 and l=2 . in the general case , the critical entropy is shown to be additive when d goes to infinity . finally , based on simple arguments , we derive an expression for the entropy at the critical point as a function of both l and d. this formula is in excellent agreement with numerical results .
