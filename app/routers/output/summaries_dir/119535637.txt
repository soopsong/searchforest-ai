we analyze the quantum walk in higher spatial dimensions and compare classical and quantum spreading as a function of time . tensor products of hadamard transformations and the discrete fourier transform arise as natural extensions of the quantum coin toss in the one - dimensional walk simulation , and other illustrative transformations are also investigated . we find that entanglement between the dimensions serves to reduce the rate of spread of the quantum walk . the classical limit is obtained by introducing a random phase variable .
