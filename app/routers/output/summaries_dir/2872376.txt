in this paper , we consider a method for implementing a quantum logic gate with photons whose wave function propagates in a one - dimensional kerr - nonlinear photonic crystal . the photonic crystal causes the incident photons to undergo bragg reflection by its periodic structure of dielectric materials and forms the photonic band structure , namely , the light dispersion relation . this dispersion relation reduces the group velocity of the wave function of the photons , so that it enhances nonlinear interaction of the photons . ( because variation of the group velocity against the wave vector is very steep , we have to tune up the wavelength of injected photons precisely , however . ) if the photonic crystal includes layers of a kerr medium , we can rotate the phase of the wave function of the incident photons by a large angle efficiently . we show that we can construct the nonlinear sign - shift ( ns ) gate proposed by knill , laflamme , and milburn ( klm ) by this method . thus , we can construct the conditional sign - flip gate for two qubits , which is crucial for quantum computation . our ns gate works with probability unity in principle while klm 's original one is a nondeterministic gate conditioned on the detection of an auxiliary photon .
