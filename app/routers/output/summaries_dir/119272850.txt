causal horizons in pure poincare $ ads$ are killing horizons generated by dilatation vector . renormalization group ( rg ) flow breaks the dilatation symmetry and makes the horizons dynamical . we propose that the boundary rg flow is dual to the thermodynamics of the causal horizon . as a check of our proposal we show that the gravity dual of the boundary $ c$-theorem is the second law of thermodynamics obeyed by causal horizons . the holographic $ c$-function is the bekenstein - hawking entropy ( density ) of the dynamical causal horizon . we explicitly construct the $ c$-function in a generic class of rg - flow geometries and show that it interpolates monotonically between the uv and ir central charges as a result of the second law .
