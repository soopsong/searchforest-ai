we demonstrated the first - order interference between coherent light at 1580 nm and 795 nm by using frequency - domain mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) . the mzi is implemented by two frequency - domain bss based on a second - order nonlinear optical effect in a periodically - poled lithium niobate waveguide with a strong pump light . we achieved the visibility of over 0.99 at 50 % conversion efficiencies of the bss . toward photonic quantum information processing , sufficiently small background photon rate is necessary . from the measurement results with a superconducting single photon detector , we discuss the feasibility of the frequency - domain mzi in a quantum regime . our estimation shows that single photon interference with the visibility above 0.9 is feasible with practical settings .
