state preparation protocols ideally require as minimal operations as possible , in order to be implemented in near - term , potentially noisy quantum devices . motivated by long range interactions ( lris ) intrinsic to many present - day experimental platforms ( trapped ions , rydberg atom arrays , etc . ) , we investigate the efficacy of variationally simulating non - trivial quantum states using the variational quantum - classical simulation ( vqcs ) protocol explored recently in [ scipost phys . 6 , 029 ( 2019 ) ] , in the presence of lris . we show that this approach leads to extremely efficient state preparation : for example , greene - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states can be prepared with o(1 ) iterations of the protocol , and a quantum critical point of the long range transverse field ising model ( tfim ) can be prepared with>99 % fidelity on a 100 qubit system with only one iteration . furthermore , we show that vqcs with lris is a promising route for exploring generic points in the phase diagram of the long - range tfim . our approach thus provides concrete , ultrafast protocols for quantum simulators equipped with long range interactions .
