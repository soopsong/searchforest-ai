recent results show that important singularities in general relativity can be naturally described in terms of finite and invariant canonical geometric objects . consequently , one can write field equations which are equivalent to einstein 's at non - singular points , but in addition remain well - defined and smooth at singularities . the black hole singularities appear to be less undesirable than it was thought , especially after we remove the part of the singularity due to the coordinate system . black hole singularities are then compatible with global hyperbolicity , and do n't make the evolution equations break down , when these are expressed in terms of the appropriate variables . the charged black holes turn out to have smooth potential and electromagnetic fields in the new atlas . classical charged particles can be modeled , in general relativity , as charged black hole solutions . since black hole singularities are accompanied by dimensional reduction , this should affect feynman 's path integrals . therefore , it is expected that singularities induce dimensional reduction effects in quantum gravity . these dimensional reduction effects are very similar to those postulated in some approaches to making quantum gravity perturbatively renormalizable . this may provide a way to test indirectly the effects of singularities , otherwise inaccessible .
