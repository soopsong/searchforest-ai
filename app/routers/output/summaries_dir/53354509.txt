we demonstrate quantum correlations in the transverse plane of continuous wave light beams by producing -4.0 db , -2.6 db and -1.5 db of squeezing in the tem00 , tem10 and tem20 hermite- gauss modes with an optical parametric amplifier , respectively . this has potential applications in quantum information networking , enabling parallel quantum information processing . we describe the setup for the generation of squeezing and analyze the effects of various experimental issues such as mode overlap between pump and seed and nonlinear losses .
