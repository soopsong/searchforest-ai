josephson parametric amplifiers ( jpa ) have become key devices in quantum science and technology with superconducting circuits . in particular , they can be utilized as quantum - limited amplifiers or as a source of squeezed microwave fields . here , we report on the detailed measurements of five flux - driven jpas , three of them exhibiting a hysteretic dependence of the resonant frequency versus the applied magnetic flux . we model the measured characteristics by numerical simulations based on the two - dimensional potential landscape of the dc superconducting quantum interference devices ( dc - squid ) , which provide the jpa nonlinearity , for a finite screening parameter $ \beta_\mathrm{l}\,{>}\,0 $ and demonstrate excellent agreement between the numerical results and the experimental data . furthermore , we study the nondegenerate response of different jpas and accurately describe the experimental results with our theory .
