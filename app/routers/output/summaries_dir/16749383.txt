recent research in multi - valued logic for quantum computing has shown practical advantages for scaling up a quantum computer . multivalued quantum systems have also been used in the framework of quantum cryptography , and the concept of a qudit cluster state has been proposed by generalizing the qubit cluster state . an evolutionary algorithm based synthesizer for ternary quantum circuits has recently been presented , as well as a synthesis method based on matrix factorization.in this paper , a recursive synthesis method for ternary quantum circuits based on the cosine - sine unitary matrix decomposition is presented .
