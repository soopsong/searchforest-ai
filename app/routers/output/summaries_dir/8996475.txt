topological quantum error - correcting codes are defined by geometrically local checks on a two - dimensional lattice of quantum bits ( qubits ) , making them particularly well suited for fault - tolerant quantum information processing . here , we present a decoding algorithm for topological codes that is faster than previously known algorithms and applies to a wider class of topological codes . our algorithm makes use of two methods inspired from statistical physics : renormalization groups and mean - field approximations . first , the topological code is approximated by a concatenated block code that can be efficiently decoded . to improve this approximation , additional consistency conditions are imposed between the blocks , and are solved by a belief propagation algorithm .
