very much as its classical counterpart , quantum cellular automata are expected to be a great tool for simulating complex quantum systems . here we introduce a partitioned model of quantum cellular automata and show how it can simulate , with the same amount of resources ( in terms of effective hilbert space dimension ) , various models of quantum walks . all the algorithms developed within quantum walk models are thus directly inherited by the quantum cellular automata . the latter , however , has its structure based on local interactions between qubits , and as such it can be more suitable for present ( and future ) experimental implementations .
