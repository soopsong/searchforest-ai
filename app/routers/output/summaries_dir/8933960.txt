we theoretically study how to control transport , bound states , and resonant states of a single photon in a one - dimensional coupled - cavity array . we find that the transport of a single photon in the cavity array can be controlled by tuning the frequency of either one or two cavities . if one of the cavities in the array has a tunable frequency , and its frequency is tuned to be larger ( or smaller ) than those of other cavities , then there is a photon bound state above ( or below ) the energy band of the coupled cavity array . however , if two cavities in the array have tunable frequencies , then there exist both bound states and resonant states . when the frequencies of the two cavities are chosen to be much larger than those of other cavities and the hopping couplings between any two nearest - neighbor cavities are weak , a single photon with a resonant wave vector can be trapped in the region between the two frequency - tunable cavities . in this case , a quantum supercavity can be formed by these two frequency - tunable cavities . we also study how to apply this photon transport control to an array of coupled superconducting transmission line resonators .
