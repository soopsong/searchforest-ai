the gradient echo memory ( gem ) scheme has potential to be a suitable protocol for storage and retrieval of optical quantum information . in this paper , we review the properties of the $ \lambda$-gem method that stores information in the ground states of three - level atomic ensembles via raman coupling . the scheme is versatile in that it can store and re - sequence multiple pulses of light . to date , this scheme has been implemented using warm rubidium gas cells . there are different phenomena that can influence the performance of these atomic systems . we investigate the impact of atomic motion and four - wave mixing and present experiments that show how parasitic four - wave mixing can be mitigated . we also use the memory to demonstrate preservation of pulse shape and the backward retrieval of pulses .
