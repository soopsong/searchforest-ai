certain quantum many - body ground states can be prepared by a large - depth quantum circuit consisting of geometrically local gates . in the presence of noise , local expectation values deviate from the correct value at most by an amount comparable to the noise rate . this happens if the action of the noiseless circuit , restricted to certain subsystems , rapidly mixes local observables up to a small correction . the encoding circuit for the surface code is given as an example .
