we investigate the entanglement of a quantum field in the expanding universe . by introducing a bipartite system using a coarse - grained scalar field , we apply the separability criterion based on the partial transpose operation and numerically calculate the bipartite entanglement between separate spatial regions . we find that the initial entangled state becomes separable or dis - entangled after the spatial separation of two points exceed the hubble horizon . this provides the necessary condition for the appearance of classicality of the quantum fluctuation . we also investigate the condition of classicality that the quantum field can be treated as the classical stochastic variables .
