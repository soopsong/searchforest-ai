in this paper we consider some ( generalized ) models which deal with n -- level atom interacting with a single radiation mode and study a general structure of rabi floppings of these generalized ones in the strong coupling regime . to solve these models we introduce multi cat states of schr{\"o}dinger in our terminology and extend the result in ( quant -- ph/0203135 ) which rabi frequencies are given by matrix elements of generalized coherent operators ( quant -- ph/0202081 ) under the rotating -- wave approximation . our work is a full generalization of frasca ( quant -- ph/0111134 ) and fujii ( quant -- ph/0203135 ) . in last we make a brief comment on an application to quantum computation on the space of qudits .
