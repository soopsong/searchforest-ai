we introduce an approach to improve the accuracy and reduce the sample complexity of near term quantum - classical algorithms . we construct a simpler initial parameterized quantum state , or ansatz , based on the past causal cone of each observable , generally yielding fewer qubits and gates . we implement this protocol on a trapped ion quantum computer and demonstrate improvement in accuracy and time - to - solution at an arbitrary point in the variational search space . we report a $ \sim 27\%$ improvement in the accuracy of the calculation of the deuteron binding energy and $ \sim 40\%$ improvement in the accuracy of the quantum approximate optimization of the maxcut problem applied to the dragon graph $ t_{3,2}$. when the time - to - solution is prioritized over accuracy , the former requires $ \sim 71\%$ fewer measurements and the latter requires $ \sim 78\%$ fewer measurements .
