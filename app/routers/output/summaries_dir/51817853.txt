balanced homodyne detector ( bhd ) that can measure the field quadratures of coherent states has been widely used in a range of quantum information technologies . generally , the bhd tends to suffer from narrow bands and an expanding bandwidth behavior usually traps into a compromise with the gain , electronic noise , and quantum to classical noise ratio , etc . in this paper , we design and construct a wideband bhd based on radio frequency and integrated circuit technology . our bhd shows bandwidth behavior up to 1.2 ghz and its quantum to classical noise ratio is around 18 db . simultaneously , the bhd has a linear performance with a gain of 4.86k and its common mode rejection ratio has also been tested as 57.9 db . with this bhd , the secret key rate of continuous - variable quantum key distribution system has a potential to achieve 66.55 mbps and 2.87 mbps respectively at the transmission distance of 10 km and 45 km . besides , with this bhd , the generation rate of quantum random number generator could reach up to 6.53gbps .
