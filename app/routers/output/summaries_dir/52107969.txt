in this paper , we argue that quantum coherence in a bipartite system can be contained either locally or in the correlations between the subsystems . the portion of quantum coherence contained within correlations can be viewed as a kind quantum correlation which we call correlated coherence . we demonstrate that the framework provided by correlated coherence allows us retrieve the same concepts of quantum correlations as defined by the asymmetric and symmetrized versions of quantum discord as well as quantum entanglement , thus providing a unified view of these correlations . we also prove that correlated coherence can be formulated as an entanglement monotone , thus demonstrating that entanglement may be viewed as a specialized form of coherence .
