the issue of realization of the transfer functions of linear quantum stochastic systems ( lqsss ) is of fundamental importance for the practical applications of such systems , especially as coherent controllers for other quantum systems . so far , most works that addressed this problem have used cascade realizations . in this work , a new method is proposed , where the transfer function of a lqss is realized by a series of a pre - processing linear static network , a reduced lqss , and a post - processing linear static network . the introduction of the pre- and post - processing static networks leaves an intermediate reduced lqss with a simple input / output structure , that is realized by a concatenation of simple cavities . a feedback connection of the cavities through a linear static network is used to produce the correct dynamics for the reduced system . the resulting realization provides a nice structural picture of the system . the key mathematical tool that allows for the construction of this realization , is an svd - like decomposition for doubled - up matrices in krein spaces . illustrative examples are provided for the theory developed .
