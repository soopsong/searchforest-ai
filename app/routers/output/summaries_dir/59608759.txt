the first generations of quantum computers will execute fault - tolerant quantum circuits , and it is very likely that such circuits will use surface quantum error correcting codes . to the best of our knowledge , no complete design automation tool for such circuits is currently available . this is to a large extent because such circuits have three dimensional layouts ( e.g. two dimensional hardware and time axis as a third dimension ) and their optimisation is still ongoing research . this work introduces surfbraid , a tool for the automatic design of surface code protected quantum circuits -- it includes a complete workflow that compiles an arbitrary quantum circuit into an intermediary clifford+t equivalent representation which is further synthesised and optimised to surface code protected structures ( for the moment , braided defects ) . surfbraid is arguably the first flexible ( modular structure , extensible through user provided scripts ) and interactive ( automatically updating the results based on user interaction , browser based ) tool for such circuits . one of the prototype 's methodological novelty is its capability to automatically estimate the resources necessary for executing large fault - tolerant circuits . a prototype implementation and the corresponding source code are available at https://alexandrupaler.github.io/quantjs/.
