we analyze the quantum regime of the dynamical backaction cooling of a mechanical resonator assisted by a driven harmonic oscillator ( cavity ) . our treatment applies to both optomechanical and electromechanical realizations and includes the effect of thermal noise in the driven oscillator . in the perturbative case , we derive the corresponding motional master equation using the nakajima - zwanzig formalism and calculate the corresponding output spectrum for the optomechanical case . then we analyze the strong optomechanical coupling regime in the limit of small cavity linewidth . finally we consider the steady state covariance matrix of the two coupled oscillators for arbitrary input power and obtain an analytical expression for the final mechanical occupancy . this is used to optimize the drive 's detuning and input power for an experimentally relevant range of parameters that includes the"ground state cooling"regime .
