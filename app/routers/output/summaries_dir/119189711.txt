the dicke state $ |d_k^n\rangle$ is an equal - weight superposition of all $ n$-qubit states with hamming weight $ k$ ( i.e. all strings of length $ n$ with exactly $ k$ ones over a binary alphabet ) . dicke states are an important class of entangled quantum states that among other things serve as starting states for combinatorial optimization quantum algorithms . we present a deterministic quantum algorithm for the preparation of dicke states . implemented as a quantum circuit , our scheme uses $ o(kn)$ gates , has depth $ o(n)$ and needs no ancilla qubits . the inductive nature of our approach allows for linear - depth preparation of arbitrary symmetric pure states and -- used in reverse -- yields a quasilinear - depth circuit for efficient compression of quantum information in the form of symmetric pure states , improving on existing work requiring quadratic depth . all of these properties even hold for linear nearest neighbor architectures .
