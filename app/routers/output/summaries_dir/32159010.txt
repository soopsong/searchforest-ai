we study the entanglement spectrum of spin-1/2 xxz ladders both analytically and numerically . our analytical approach is based on perturbation theory starting either from the limit of strong rung coupling , or from the opposite case of dominant coupling along the legs . in the former case we find to leading order that the entanglement hamiltonian is also of nearest - neighbor xxz form although with an in general renormalized anisotropy . for the cases of xx and isotropic heisenberg ladders no such renormalization takes place . in the heisenberg case the second order correction to the entanglement hamiltonian consists of a renormalization of the nearest neighbor coupling plus an unfrustrated next nearest neighbor coupling . in the opposite regime of strong coupling along the legs , we point out an interesting connection of the entanglement spectrum to the lehmann representation of single chain spectral functions of operators appearing in the physical hamiltonian coupling the two chains .
