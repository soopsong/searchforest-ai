a * -algebraic indefinite structure of quantum stochastic ( qs ) calculus is introduced and a continuity property of generalized nonadapted qs integrals is proved under the natural integrability conditions in an infinitely dimensional nuclear space . the class of nondemolition output qs processes in quantum open systems is characterized in terms of the qs calculus , and the problem of qs nonlinear filtering with respect to nondemolition continuous measurments is investigated . the stochastic calculus of a posteriori conditional expectations in quantum observed systems is developed and a general quantum filtering stochastic equation for a qs process is derived . an application to the description of the spontaneous collapse of the quantum spin under continuous observation is given .
