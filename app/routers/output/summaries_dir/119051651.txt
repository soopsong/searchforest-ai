we study the impact of the finite - size effect on the continuous - variable measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution ( cv - mdi qkd ) protocol , mainly considering the finite - size effect on the parameter estimation procedure . the central - limit theorem and maximum likelihood estimation theorem are used to estimate the parameters . we also analyze the relationship between the number of exchanged signals and the optimal modulation variance in the protocol . it is proved that when charlie 's position is close to bob , the cv - mdi qkd protocol has the farthest transmission distance in the finite - size scenario . finally , we discuss the impact of finite - size effects related to the practical detection in the cv - mdi qkd protocol . the overall results indicate that the finite - size effect has a great influence on the secret key rate of the cv - mdi qkd protocol and should not be ignored .
