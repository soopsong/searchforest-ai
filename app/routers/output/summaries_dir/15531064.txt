birth of objective properties from subjective quantum world has been one of the key questions in the quantum - to - classical transition . basing on recent results in the field , we study it in a quantum mechanical model of a boson - boson interaction - quantum brownian motion . using various simplifications we prove a formation for thermal environments of , so called , spectrum broadcast structures , responsible for perceived objectivity . in the quantum measurement limit we prove that this structure is always formed , providing the characteristic timescales . including self - hamiltonians of the environment , we show the exponential scaling of the effect with the size of the environment . finally , in the full model we numerically study the influence of squeezing in the initial state of the environment , showing broader regions of formation than for non - squeezed thermal states .
