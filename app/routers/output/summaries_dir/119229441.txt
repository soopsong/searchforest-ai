a theoretical model describing the raman scattering process in atomic vapors is constructed . the treatment investigates the low - excitation regime suitable for modern experimental applications . despite the incorporated decoherence effects ( possibly mode dependent ) it allows for a direct separation of the time evolution from the spatial degrees of freedom . the impact of noise on the temporal properties of the process is examined . the model is applied in two experimentally relevant situations of ultra - cold and room - temperature atoms . the spatial eigenmodes of the stokes photons and their coupling to atomic excitations are computed . similarly , dynamics and the waveform of the collective atomic state are derived for quantum memory implementations .
