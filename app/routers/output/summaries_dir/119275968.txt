the concept of divisibility of dynamical maps is used to introduce an analogous concept for quantum channels by analyzing the \textit{simulability } of channels by means of dynamical maps . in particular , this is addressed for lindblad divisible , completely positive divisible and positive divisible dynamical maps . the corresponding l - divisible , cp - divisible and p - divisible subsets of channels are characterized ( exploiting the results by wolf et al . , comm . math . phys . , 279(1):147 - 168 , 2008 ) and visualized for the case of qubit channels . we discuss the general inclusions among divisibility sets and show several equivalences for qubit channels . to this end we study the conditions of l - divisibility for finite dimensional channels , especially the cases with negative eigenvalues , extending and completing the results of phys . rev . lett . , 101(15):150402 , 2008 . furthermore we show that transitions between every two of the defined divisibility sets are allowed . we explore particular examples of dynamical maps to compare these concepts . finally , we show that every divisible but not infinitesimal divisible qubit channel ( in positive maps ) is entanglement - breaking , and open the question if something similar occurs for higher dimensions .
