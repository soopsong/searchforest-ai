in this paper we show that there is a direct correspondence between quantum boolean operations and certain forms of classical ( non - quantum ) logic known as reed - muller expansions . this allows us to readily convert boolean circuits into their quantum equivalents . a direct result of this is that the problem of synthesis and optimization of quantum boolean logic can be tackled within the field of reed - muller logic .
