we propose an effective and flexible scheme for reverse engineering of a hamiltonian by designing the evolution operators to eliminate the terms of hamiltonian which are hard to be realized in practice . different from transitionless quantum driving ( tqd ) [ 31 ] , the present scheme is focus on only one or parts of moving states in a d - dimension ( d>3 ) system . the numerical simulation shows that the present scheme not only contains the results of tqd , but also has more free parameters , which make this scheme more flexible . an example is given by using this scheme to realize the population transfer for a rydberg atom . the influences of various decoherence processes are discussed by numerical simulation and the result shows that the scheme is fast and robust against the decoherence and operational imperfection . therefore , this scheme may be used to construct a hamiltonian which can be realized in experiments
