mode - entanglement based criteria and measures become insufficient for broadband emission , e.g. from spasers ( plasmonic nano - lasers ) . we introduce criteria and measures for the ( i ) total entanglement of two wavepackets , ( ii ) entanglement of a wavepacket with an ensemble and ( iii ) total nonclassicality of a wavepacket~(wp ) . we discuss these criteria in the context of ( i ) entanglement of two wps emitted from two initially entangled cavities ( or two initially entangled atoms ) and ( ii ) entanglement of an emitted wp with the ensemble / atom for the spontaneous emission and the single - photon superradiance . we also show that , ( iii ) when the two constituent modes of a wp are entangled , this creates nonclassicality in the wp as a noise reduction below the standard quantum limit . the criteria we introduce are , all , compatible with near - field detectors .
