we consider the effects of experimental imperfections on the problem of estimation - based feedback control of a trapped particle under continuous position measurement . these limitations violate the assumption that the estimator ( i.e. filter ) accurately models the underlying system , thus requiring a separate analysis of the system and filter dynamics . we quantify the parameter regimes for stable cooling , and show that the control scheme is robust to detector inefficiency , time delay , technical noise , and miscalibrated parameters . we apply these results to the specific context of a weakly interacting bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . given that this system has previously been shown to be less stable than a feedback - cooled bec with strong interatomic interactions , this result shows that reasonable experimental imperfections do not limit the feasibility of cooling a bec by continuous measurement and feedback .
