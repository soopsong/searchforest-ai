the quantum open system simulation is an important category of quantum simulation . by simulating the thermalisation process of the zero temperature , we can solve the ground - state problem of quantum systems . to realise the open - system evolution on the quantum computer , we need to encode the environment using qubits . however , usually the environment is much larger than the system , i.e. plenty of qubits are required if the environment is directly encoded . in this paper , we propose a way to simulate open - system dynamics by reproducing reservoir correlation functions using a minimised hilbert space . in this way , we only need a small number of qubits to represent the environment . to simulate the $ n$-th - order expansion of the time - convolutionless master equation by reproducing up to $ n$-th - order correlation functions , the number of qubits representing the environment is $ \sim \frac{n}{2}\log_2(n_\omega n_\beta)$. here , $ n_\omega$ is the number of frequencies in the discretised environment spectrum , and $ n_\beta$ is the number of terms in the system - environment coupling . by reproducing second - order correlation functions , i.e. taking $ n = 2 $ , we can simulate the markovian quantum master equation . in our algorithm , the environment on the quantum computer could be even smaller than the system .
