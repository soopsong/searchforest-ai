we describe in detail a set of ideas for implementing qubits , quantum gates and quantum gate networks in a semiconductor heterostructure device . our proposal is based on an extension of the technology used for surface acoustic wave ( saw ) based single - electron transport devices . these devices allow single electrons to be captured from a two - dimensional electron gas in the potential minima of a saw . we discuss how this technology can be adapted to allow the capture of electrons in pure spin states and how both single and two - qubit gates can be constructed using magnetic and non - magnetic gate technology . we give designs for readout gates to allow the spin state of the electrons to be measured and discuss how combinations of gates can be connected to make multi - qubit networks . finally we consider decoherence and other sources of error , and how they can be minimized for our design .
