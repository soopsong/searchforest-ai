we present novel algorithms to estimate outcomes for qubit quantum circuits . notably , these methods can simulate a clifford circuit in linear time without ever writing down stabilizer states explicitly . these algorithms outperform previous noisy near - clifford techniques for most circuits . we identify a large class of input states that can be efficiently simulated despite not being stabilizer states . the algorithms leverage probability distributions constructed from bloch vectors , paralleling previously known algorithms that use the discrete wigner function for qutrits .
