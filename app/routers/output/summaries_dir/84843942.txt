a simple model of small world quantum networks , in which a central node plays essential role , is introduced for sharing entanglement over long distances . in view of the challenges in setting up advanced quantum labs which allows only few nodes in a network to play a central role , this kind of small world network may be more relevant for entanglement distribution . it is shown that by only adding a small number of short - cuts , it is possible to produce maximally entangled pairs between arbitrary nodes in the network . besides this , the threshold values for the initial amount of entanglement and the distance between nodes , for obtaining a highly entangled states shared between remote points are also investigated .
