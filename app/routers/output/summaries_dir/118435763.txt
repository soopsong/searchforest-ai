most experimental and theoretical studies of adiabatic optimization use stoquastic hamiltonians , whose ground states are expressible using only real nonnegative amplitudes . this raises a question as to whether classical monte carlo methods can simulate stoquastic adiabatic algorithms with polynomial overhead . here , we analyze diffusion monte carlo algorithms . we argue that , based on differences between l1 and l2 normalized states , these algorithms suffer from certain obstructions preventing them from efficiently simulating stoquastic adiabatic evolution in generality . in practice however , we obtain good performance by introducing a method that we call substochastic monte carlo . in fact , our simulations are good classical optimization algorithms in their own right , competitive with the best previously known heuristic solvers for max - k - sat at k=2,3,4 .
