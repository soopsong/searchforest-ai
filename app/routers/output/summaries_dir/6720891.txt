the many low energy modes near a black hole horizon give the thermal atmosphere a divergent entropy which becomes of order $ a/4g$ with a planck scale cut - off . however , sorkin has given a newtonian argument for 3 + 1 schwarzschild black holes to the effect that fluctuations of such modes provide the horizon with a non - zero quantum mechanical width . this width then effectively enforces a cut - off at much larger distances so that the entropy of the thermal atmosphere is negligible in comparison with $ a/4g$ for large black holes . we generalize and improve this result by giving a relativistic argument valid for any spherical black hole in any dimension . the result is again a cut - off $ l_c$ at a geometric mean of the planck scale and the black hole radius ; in particular , $ l_c^d \sim \frac{r}{t_h } \ell_p^{d-2}$. with this cut - off , the entropy of the thermal atmosphere is again parametrically small in comparison with the bekenstein - hawking entropy of the black hole . the effect of a large number $ n$ of fundamental fields and the discrepancies from naive predictions of a stretched horizon model are also discussed .
