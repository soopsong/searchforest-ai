we present a method for measuring magnetic field gradients with macroscopic singlet states realized with ensembles of spin - j particles . while the singlet state is completely insensitive to homogeneous magnetic fields , the variance of its collective spin components is highly sensitive to field gradients . we compute the dynamics of this variance analytically for a chain of spins and also for an ensemble of particles with a given density distribution . we find an upper bound on how precisely the field gradient can be estimated from the measured data . based on our calculations , differential magnetometry can be carried out with cold atomic ensembles using a multipartite singlet state obtained via spin squeezing . on the other hand , comparing the metrological properties of the experimentally prepared state to that of the ideal singlet can be used as further evidence that a singlet state has indeed been created .
