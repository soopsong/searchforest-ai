the three - spin-$1/2 $ decoherence - free subsystem defines a logical qubit protected from collective noise and supports exchange - only universal gates . such logical qubits are well - suited for implementation with electrically - defined quantum dots . exact exchange - only entangling logical gates exist but are challenging to construct and understand . we use a decoupling strategy to obtain straightforward approximate entangling gates . a benefit of the strategy is that if the physical spins are aligned , then it can implement evolution under entangling hamiltonians . hamiltonians expressible as linear combinations of logical pauli products not involving $ \sigma_y$ can be implemented directly . self - inverse gates that are constructible from these hamiltonians , such as the cnot , can be implemented without the assumption on the physical spins . we compare the control complexity of implementing cnot to previous methods and find that the complexity for fault - tolerant fidelities is competitive .
