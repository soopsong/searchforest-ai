einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) steering is the explicit demonstration of the fact that the measurements of one party can in influence the quantum state held by another , distant , party , and do so even if the measurements themselves are untrusted . this has been shown to allow one - sided device - independent quantum - information tasks between two remote parties . however , in general , advanced multiparty protocols for generic quantum technologies , such as quantum secret sharing and blind quantum computing for quantum networks , demand multipartite quantum correlations of graph states shared between more than two parties . here , we show that , when one part of a quantum multidimensional system composed of a two - colorable graph state ( e.g. , cluster and greenberger - horne - zeilinger states ) is attacked by an eavesdropper using a universal cloning machine , only one of the copy subsystems can exhibit multipartite epr steering but not both . such a no - sharing restriction secures both state sources and channels against cloning - based attacks for generic quantum networking tasks , such as distributed quantum - information processing , in the presence of uncharacterized measurement apparatuses .
