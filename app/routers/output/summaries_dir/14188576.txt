we derive a set of hierarchical equations for qubits interacting with a lorentz - broadened cavity mode at zero temperature , without using the rotating - wave , born , and markovian approximations . we use this exact method to reexamine the entanglement dynamics of two qubits interacting with a common bath , which was previously solved only under the rotating - wave and single - excitation approximations . with the exact hierarchy equation method used here , we observe significant differences in the resulting physics , compared to the previous results with various approximations . double excitations due to counter - rotating - wave terms are also found to have remarkable effects on the dynamics of entanglement .
