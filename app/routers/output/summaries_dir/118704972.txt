given two quantum states of n q - bits we are interested to find the shortest quantum circuit consisting of only one- and two- q - bit gates that would transfer one state into another . we call it the quantum maze problem for the reasons described in the paper . we argue that in a large n limit the quantum maze problem is equivalent to the problem of finding a semiclassical trajectory of some lattice field theory ( the dual theory ) on an n+1 dimensional space - time with geometrically flat , but topologically compact spatial slices . the spatial fundamental domain is an n dimensional hyper - rhombohedron , and the temporal direction describes transitions from an arbitrary initial state to an arbitrary target state . we first consider a complex klein - gordon field theory and argue that it can only be used to study the shortest quantum circuits which do not involve generators composed of tensor products of multiple pauli z matrices . since such situation is not generic we call it the z - problem . on the dual field theory side the z - problem corresponds to massless excitations of the phase ( goldstone modes ) that we attempt to fix using higgs mechanism . the simplest dual theory which does not suffer from the massless excitation ( or from the z - problem ) is the abelian - higgs model which we argue can be used for finding the shortest quantum circuits . since every trajectory of the field theory is mapped directly to a quantum circuit , the shortest quantum circuits are identified with semiclassical trajectories . we also discuss the complexity of an actual algorithm that uses a dual theory prospective for solving the quantum maze problem and compare it with a geometric approach . we argue that it might be possible to solve the problem in sub - exponential time in 2^n , but for that we must consider the klein - gordon theory on curved spatial geometry and/or more complicated ( than n - torus ) topology .
