in this paper , we explore how to constructively manipulate qubits by rotating bloch spheres . it is revealed that three - rotation and one - rotation hamiltonian controls can be constructed to steer qubits when two tunable hamiltonian controls are available . it is demonstrated in this research that local - wave function controls such as bang - bang , triangle - function and quadratic function controls can be utilized to manipulate quantum states on the bloch sphere . a new kind of time - energy performance index is proposed to trade - off time and energy resource cost , in which control magnitudes are optimized in terms of this kind of performance . it is further exemplified that this idea can be generalized to manipulate encoded qubits on the controllable subspace .
