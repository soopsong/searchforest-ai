we propose a high - efficiency three - party quantum key agreement protocol , by utilizing two - photon polarization - entangled bell states and a few single - photon polarization states as the information carriers , and we use the quantum dense coding method to improve its efficiency . in this protocol , each participant performs one of four unitary operations to encode their sub - secret key on the passing photons which contain two parts , the first quantum qubits of bell states and a small number of single - photon states . at the end of this protocol , based on very little information announced by other , all participants involved can deduce the same final shared key simultaneously . we analyze the security and the efficiency of this protocol , showing that it has a high efficiency and can resist both outside attacks and inside attacks . as a consequence , our protocol is a secure and efficient three - party quantum key agreement protocol .
