we explore the properties of holographic entanglement of purification ( eop ) for two disjoint strips in the schwarzschild - ads black brane and the vaidya - ads black brane spacetimes . for two given strips on the same boundary of schwarzschild - ads spacetime , there is an upper bound of the separation beyond which the holographic eop will always vanish no matter how wide the strips are . in the case that two strips are in the two boundaries of the spacetime respectively , we find that the holographic eop exists only when the strips are wide enough . if the width is finite , the eop can be nonzero in a finite time region . for thermal quench case , we find that the equilibrium time of holographic eop is only sensitive to the width of strips , while that of the holographic mutual information is sensitive not only to the width of strips but also to their separation .
