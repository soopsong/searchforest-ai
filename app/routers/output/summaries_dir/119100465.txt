we modify the time dependent schr\"odinger - newton equation by using a potential for a solid sphere suggested by j\"a\"askel\"ainen ( j\"a\"askel\"ainen 2012 phys . rev . a 86 052105 ) as well as a hollow - sphere potential . compared to our recent paper ( giulini and gro{\ss}ardt 2011 class . quantum grav . 28 195026 ) where a single point - particle , i.e. a coulomb potential , was considered this has been suggested to be a more realistic model for a molecule . surprisingly , compared to our previous results , inhibitions of dispersion of a gaussian wave packet occur at even smaller masses for the solid - sphere potential , given that the width of the wave packet is not exceeded by the radius of the sphere .
