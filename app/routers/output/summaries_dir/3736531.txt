a poisson model for entanglement optimization in quantum repeater networks is defined in this paper . the optimization framework fuses the fundamental concepts of quantum shannon theory with the theory of evolutionary algorithms and seismic wave propagations in nature . the optimization model aims to maximize the entanglement fidelity and relative entropy of entanglement for all entangled connections of the quantum network . the cost functions are subject of a minimization defined to cover and integrate the physical attributes of entanglement transmission , purification , and storage of entanglement in quantum memories . the method can be implemented with low complexity that allows a straightforward application in future quantum internet and quantum networking scenarios .
