we propose an effective set of elementary quantum gates which provide an encoded universality and demonstrate the physical feasibility of these gates for the solid - state quantum computer based on the multi - atomic systems in the qed cavity . we use the two - qubit encoding and swapping - based operations to simplify a physical realization of universal quantum computing and add the immunity to a number of errors . this approach allows to implement any encoded single - qubit operation by three elementary gates and the encoded controlled- not operation can be performed in a single step . the considerable advantages are also shown for implementing some commonly used controlled gates .
