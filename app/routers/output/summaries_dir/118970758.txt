measurement - based quantum computing is one of the most promising quantum computing models . although various universal resource states have been proposed so far , it was open whether only two pauli bases are enough for both of universal measurement - based quantum computing and its verification . in this paper , we construct a universal hypergraph state that only requires $ x$ and $ z$-basis measurements for universal measurement - based quantum computing . we also show that universal measurement - based quantum computing on our hypergraph state can be verified in polynomial time using only $ x$ and $ z$-basis measurements . furthermore , in order to demonstrate an advantage of our hypergraph state , we construct a verifiable blind quantum computing protocol that requires only $ x$ and $ z$-basis measurements for the client .
