feedback control of quantum systems via continuous measurement involves complex nonlinear dynamics . except in very special cases , even for a single qubit optimal feedback protocols are unknown . not even do intuitive candidates exist for choosing the measurement basis , which is the primary non - trivial ingredient in the feedback control of a qubit . here we present a series of arguments that suggest a particular form for the optimal protocol for a broad class of noise sources in the regime of good control . this regime is defined as that in which the control is strong enough to keep the system close to the desired state . with the assumption of this form the remaining parameters can be determined via a numerical search . the result is a non - trivial feedback protocol valid for all feedback strengths in the regime of good control . we conjecture that this protocol is optimal to leading order in the small parameters that define this regime . the protocol can be described relatively simply , and as a notable feature contains a discontinuity as a function of the feedback strength .
