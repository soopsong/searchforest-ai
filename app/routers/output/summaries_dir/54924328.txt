the purpose of this paper is to provide a brief review of some recent developments in quantum feedback networks and control . a quantum feedback network ( qfn ) is an interconnected system consisting of open quantum systems linked by free fields and/or direct physical couplings . basic network constructs , including series connections as well as feedback loops , are discussed . the quantum feedback network theory provides a natural framework for analysis and design . basic properties such as dissipation , stability , passivity and gain of open quantum systems are discussed . control system design is also discussed , primarily in the context of open linear quantum stochastic systems . the issue of physical realizability is discussed , and explicit criteria for stability , positive real lemma , and bounded real lemma are presented . finally for linear quantum systems , coherent $ h^\infty$ and lqg control are described .
