we investigate performance bounds for feedback control of distributed plants where the controller can be centralized ( i.e. it has access to measurements from the whole plant ) , but sensors only measure differences between neighboring subsystem outputs . such"distributed sensing"can be a technological necessity in applications where system size exceeds accuracy requirements by many orders of magnitude . we formulate how distributed sensing generally limits feedback performance robust to measurement noise and to model uncertainty , without assuming any controller restrictions ( among others , no"distributed control"restriction ) . a major practical consequence is the necessity to cut down integral action on some modes . we particularize the results to spatially invariant systems and finally illustrate implications of our developments for stabilizing the segmented primary mirror of the european extremely large telescope .
