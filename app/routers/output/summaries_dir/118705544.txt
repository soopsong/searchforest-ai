to implement a set of universal quantum logic gates based on non - abelian geometric phases , it is a conventional wisdom that quantum systems beyond two levels are required , which is extremely difficult to fulfil for superconducting qubits , appearing to be a main reason why only single qubit gates was implemented in a recent experiment [ a. a. abdumalikov jr \emph{et al } . , nature 496 , 482 ( 2013 ) ] . here we propose to realize non - adiabatic holonomic quantum computation in decoherence - free subspace on circuit qed , where one can use only the two levels in transmon qubits , a usual interaction , and a minimal resource for the decoherence - free subspace encoding . in particular , our scheme not only overcomes the difficulties encountered in previous studies , but also can still achieve considerably large effective coupling strength , such that high fidelity quantum gates can be achieved . therefore , the present scheme makes it very promising way to realize robust holonomic quantum computation with superconducting circuits .
