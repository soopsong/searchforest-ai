we study the impact of cooperative many - body effects on the operation of periodically - driven quantum thermal machines , particularly heat engines and refrigerators . in suitable geometries , $ n$ two - level atoms can exchange energy with the driving field and the ( hot and cold ) thermal baths at a faster rate than a single atom due to their su(2 ) symmetry that causes the atoms to behave as a collective spin-$n/2 $ particle . this cooperative effect boosts the power output of heat engines compared to the power output of $ n$ independent , incoherent , heat engines . in the refrigeration regime , similar cooling - power boost takes place .
