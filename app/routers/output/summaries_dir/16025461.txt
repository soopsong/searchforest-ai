fermionic linear optics is efficiently classically simulatable . here it is shown that the set of states achievable with fermionic linear optics and particle measurements is the closure of a low dimensional lie group . the weakness of fermionic linear optics and measurements can therefore be explained and contrasted with the strength of bosonic linear optics with particle measurements . an analysis of fermionic linear optics is used to show that the two - qubit matchgates and the simulatable matchcircuits introduced by valiant generate a monoid of extended fermionic linear optics operators . a useful interpretation of efficient classical simulations such as this one is as a simulation of a model of non - deterministic quantum computation . problem areas for future investigations are suggested .
