the quantum speed limit is a fundamental upper bound on the speed of quantum evolution . however , the actual mathematical expression of this fundamental limit depends on the choice of a measure of distinguishability of quantum states . we show that quantum speed limits are universally characterized by the schatten-$p$-norm of the generator of quantum dynamics . since computing schatten-$p$-norms can be mathematically involved , we then develop an alternative approach in wigner phase space . we find that the quantum speed limit in wigner space is fully equivalent to expressions in density operator space , but that the new bound is significantly easier to compute . our results are illustrated for the parametric harmonic oscillator and for quantum brownian motion .
