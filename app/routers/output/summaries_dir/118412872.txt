in continuous - variable quantum information , non - gaussian entangled states that are obtained from gaussian entangled states via photon subtraction are known to contain more entanglement . this makes them better resources for quantum information processing protocols , such as , quantum teleportation . we discuss the teleportation of non - gaussian , non - classical schr\"odinger - cat states of light using two - mode squeezed vacuum light that is made non - gaussian via subtraction of a photon from each of the two modes . we consider the experimentally realizable cat states produced by subtracting a photon from the single - mode squeezed vacuum state . we discuss two figures of merit for the teleportation process , a ) the fidelity , and b ) the maximum negativity of the wigner function at the output . we elucidate how the non - gaussian entangled resource lowers the requirements on the amount of squeezing necessary to achieve any given fidelity of teleportation , or to achieve negative values of the wigner function at the output .
