the cross - resonant gate is an entangling gate for fixed frequency superconducting qubits introduced for untunable qubits . while being simple and extensible , it suffers from long duration and limited fidelity . using two different optimal control algorithms , we probe the quantum speed limit for a cnot gate in this system . we show that the ability to approach this limit depends strongly on the ansatz used to describe the optimal control pulse . a piecewise constant ansatz with a single carrier leads to an experimentally feasible pulse shape , shorter than the one currently used in experiments , but that remains relatively far from the speed limit . on the other hand , an ansatz based on the two dominant frequencies involved in the optimal control problem allows to generate an optimal solution more than twice as fast , in under $ 30$ns . this comes close to the theoretical quantum speed limit , which we estimate at $ 15$ns for typical circuit - qed parameters , which is more than an order of magnitude faster than current experimental microwave - driven realizations , and more than twice as fast as tunable direct - coupling experimental realizations .
