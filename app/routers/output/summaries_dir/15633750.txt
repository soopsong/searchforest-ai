it is proved that there exist subspaces of bipartite tensor product spaces that have no orthonormal bases that can be perfectly distinguished by means of locc protocols . a corollary of this fact is that there exist quantum channels having sub - optimal classical capacity even when the receiver may communicate classically with a third party that represents the channel 's environment .
