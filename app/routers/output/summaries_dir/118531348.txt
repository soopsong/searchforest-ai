quantum walk ( qw ) in presence of lattice disorders leads to a multitude of interesting phenomena , such as anderson localization . while qw has been realized in various optical and atomic systems , its implementation with superconducting qubits still remains pending . the major challenge in simulating qw with superconducting qubits emerges from the fact that on - chip superconducting qubits can not hop between two adjacent lattice sites . here we overcome this barrier and develop a scheme to realize the discrete time qw by placing a pair of superconducting qubits on each site of a 1d lattice and treating an excitation as a walker . it is also shown that lattice disorders can be introduced and fully controlled within this scheme by tuning the qubit parameters . we observe a distinct signature of transition from the ballistic regime to a localized qw with an increasing strength of disorder . finally , an eight - qubit experiment is proposed where the signature of localized and delocalized regimes can be detected with existing superconducting technology .
