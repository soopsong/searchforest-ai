we demonstrate that tunable attractive ( bonding ) and repulsive ( anti - bonding ) forces can arise in highly asymmetric structures coupled to external radiation , a consequence of the bonding / anti - bonding level repulsion of guided - wave resonances that was first predicted in symmetric systems . our focus is a geometry consisting of a photonic - crystal ( holey ) membrane suspended above an unpatterned layered substrate , supporting planar waveguide modes that can couple via the periodic modulation of the holey membrane . asymmetric geometries have a clear advantage in ease of fabrication and experimental characterization compared to symmetric double - membrane structures . we show that the asymmetry can also lead to unusual behavior in the force magnitudes of a bonding / antibonding pair as the membrane separation changes , including nonmonotonic dependences on the separation . we propose a computational method that obtains the entire force spectrum via a single time - domain simulation , by fourier - transforming the response to a short pulse and thereby obtaining the frequency - dependent stress tensor . we point out that by operating with two , instead of a single frequency , these evanescent forces can be exploited to tune the spring constant of the membrane without changing its equilibrium separation .
