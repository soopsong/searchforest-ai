hybrid spin - mechanical systems have great potentials in sensing , macroscopic quantum mechanics , and quantum information science . in order to induce strong coupling between an electron spin and the center - of - mass motion of a mechanical oscillator , a large magnetic gradient is usually required , which is difficult to achieve . here we show that strong coupling between the electron spin of a nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center and the torsional vibration of an optically levitated nanodiamond can be achieved in a uniform magnetic field . thanks to the uniform magnetic field , multiple spins can strongly couple to the torsional vibration at the same time . we propose to utilize this new coupling mechanism to realize the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model by an ensemble of nv centers in a levitated nanodiamond . the quantum phase transition in the lmg model and finite number effects can be observed with this system . we also propose to generate torsional superposition states and realize torsional matter - wave interferometry with spin - torsional coupling .
