we determine the p->q norms of the gaussian one - mode quantum - limited attenuator and amplifier and prove that they are achieved by gaussian states , extending to noncommutative probability the seminal theorem"gaussian kernels have only gaussian maximizers"(lieb in invent math 102(1):179 - 208 , 1990 ) . the quantum - limited attenuator and amplifier are the building blocks of quantum gaussian channels , which play a key role in quantum communication theory since they model in the quantum regime the attenuation and the noise affecting any electromagnetic signal . our result is crucial to prove the longstanding conjecture stating that gaussian input states minimize the output entropy of one - mode phase - covariant quantum gaussian channels for fixed input entropy . our proof technique is based on a new noncommutative logarithmic sobolev inequality , and it can be used to determine the p->q norms of any quantum semigroup .
