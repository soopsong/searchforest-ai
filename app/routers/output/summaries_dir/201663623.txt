the ability to harness the dynamics of quantum information and entanglement is necessary for the development of quantum technologies and the study of complex quantum systems . on the theoretical side the dynamics of quantum information is a topic that is helping us unify and confront common problems in otherwise disparate fields in physics , such as quantum statistical mechanics and cosmology . on the experimental side the impressive developments on the manipulation of neutral atoms and trapped ions are providing new capabilities to probe their quantum dynamics . here , we overview and discuss progress in characterizing and understanding the dynamics of quantum entanglement and information scrambling in quantum many - body systems . the level of control attainable over both the internal and external degrees of freedom of individual particles in these systems provides great insight into the intrinsic connection between entanglement and thermodynamics , bounds on information transport and computational complexity of interacting systems . in turn this understanding should enable the realization of quantum technologies .
