we analyze the formation of squeezed states in a condensate of ultracold bosonic atoms confined by a double - well potential . the emphasis is set on the dynamical formation of such states from initially coherent many - body quantum states . two cases are described : the squeezing formation in the evolution of the system around the stable point , and in the short time evolution in the vicinity of an unstable point . the latter is shown to produce highly squeezed states on very short times . on the basis of a semiclassical approximation to the bose - hubbard hamiltonian , we are able to predict the amount of squeezing , its scaling with $ n$ and the speed of coherent spin formation with simple analytical formulas which successfully describe the numerical bose - hubbard results . this new method of producing highly squeezed spin states in systems of ultracold atoms is compared to other standard methods in the literature .
