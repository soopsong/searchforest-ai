we investigate a general scheme for generating , either dynamically or in the steady state , continuous variable entanglement between two mechanical resonators with different frequencies . we employ an optomechanical system in which a single optical cavity mode driven by a suitably chosen two - tone field is coupled to the two resonators . significantly large mechanical entanglement can be achieved , which is extremely robust with respect to temperature .
