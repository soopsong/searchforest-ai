the evolution of classical optical fields propagating through atmospheric turbulence is investigated under arbitrary conditions . we use the single - phase screen ( sps ) method and the infinitesimal propagation equation ( ipe ) , a multi - phase screen ( mps ) method , to compute the optical power fractions retained in an input laguerre - gauss ( lg ) mode or transferred to higher order lg modes . although they show the same trend while the scintillation is weak , the ipe and sps predictions deviate when the strength of scintillation passes a certain threshold . these predictions are compared with numerical simulations of optical fields propagating through turbulence . the simulations are performed using an mps model , based on the kolmogorov theory of turbulence , for different turbulence conditions to allow comparison in both weak and strong scintillation . the numerical results agree well with the ipe results in all conditions , but deviate from the sps results for strong scintillation .
