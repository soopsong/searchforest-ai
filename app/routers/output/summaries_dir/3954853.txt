in this paper we investigate system identification for general quantum linear systems . we consider the situation where the input field is prepared as stationary ( squeezed ) quantum noise . in this regime the output field is characterised by the power spectrum , which encodes covariance of the output state . we address the following two questions : ( 1 ) which parameters can be identified from the power spectrum ? ( 2 ) how to construct a system realisation from the power spectrum ? the power spectrum depends on the system parameters via the transfer function . we show that the transfer function can be uniquely recovered from the power spectrum , so that equivalent systems are related by a symplectic transformation .
