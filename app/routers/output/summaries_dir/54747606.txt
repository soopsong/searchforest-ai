typical optomechanical systems involving optical cavities and mechanical oscillators rely on a coupling that varies linearly with the oscillator displacement . however , recently a coupling varying instead as the square of the mechanical displacement has been realized , presenting new possibilities for non - demolition measurements and mechanical squeezing . in this article we present a quantum mechanical study of a generic quadratic - coupling optomechanical hamiltonian . first , neglecting dissipation , we provide analytical results for the dressed states , spectrum , phonon statistics and entanglement . subsequently , accounting for dissipation , we supply a numerical treatment using a master equation approach . we expect our results to be of use to optomechanical spectroscopy , state transfer , wavefunction engineering , and entanglement generation .
