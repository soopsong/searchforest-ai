quantum entanglement is notorious for being a very fragile resource . significant efforts have been put into the study of entanglement degradation in the presence of a realistic noisy environment . here , we present a theoretical and an experimental study of the decoherence properties of entangled pairs of qubits . the entanglement dynamics of maximally entangled qubit pairs is shown to be related in a simple way to the noise representation in the bloch sphere picture . we derive the entanglement level in the case when both qubits are transmitted through any arbitrary unital pauli channel , and compared it to the case when the channel is applied only to one of the qubits . the dynamics of both cases was verified experimentally using an all - optical setup . we further investigated the evolution of partially entangled initial states . different dynamics was observed for initial mixed and pure states of the same entanglement level .
