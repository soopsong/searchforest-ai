it has been shown that non - stabilizer eigenstates of permutation gates are appropriate for allowing $ d$-dimensional universal quantum computing ( uqc ) based on minimal informationally complete povms . the relevant quantum gates may be built from subgroups of finite index of the modular group $ \gamma = psl(2,\mathbb{z})$ [ m. planat , entropy 20 , 16 ( 2018 ) ] or more generally from subgroups of fundamental groups of $ 3$-manifolds [ m. planat , r. aschheim , m.~m . amaral and k. irwin , arxiv 1802.04196(quant - ph ) ] . in this paper , previous work is encompassed by the use of torsion - free subgroups of bianchi groups for deriving the quantum gate generators of uqc . a special role is played by a chain of bianchi congruence $ n$-cusped links starting with thurston 's link .
