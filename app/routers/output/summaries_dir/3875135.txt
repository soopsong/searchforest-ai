we propose a standing wave decomposition ( swd ) approximation to gaussian process regression ( gp ) . gp involves a costly matrix inversion operation , which limits applicability to large data analysis . for an input space that can be approximated by a grid and when correlations among data are short - ranged , the kernel matrix inversion can be replaced by analytic diagonalization using the swd . we show that this approach applies to uni- and multi - dimensional input data , extends to include longer - range correlations , and the grid can be in a latent space and used as inducing points . through simulations , we show that our approximate method applied to the squared exponential kernel outperforms existing methods in predictive accuracy per unit time in the regime where data are plentiful . our swd - gp is recommended for regression analyses where there is a relatively large amount of data and/or there are constraints on computation time .
