quantum secure communication brings a new direction for information security . as an important component of quantum secure communication , deterministic joint remote state preparation ( djrsp ) could securely transmit a quantum state with 100\% success probability . in this paper , we study how the efficiency of djrsp is affected when qubits involved in the protocol are subjected to noise or decoherence . taking a ghz based djrsp scheme as an example , we study all types of noise usually encountered in real - world implementations of quantum communication protocols , i.e. , the bit - flip , phase - flip ( phase - damping ) , depolarizing , and amplitude - damping noise . our study shows that the fidelity of the output state depends on the phase factor , the amplitude factor and the noise parameter in the bit - flip noise , while the fidelity only depends on the amplitude factor and the noise parameter in the other three types of noise . and the receiver will get different output states depending on the first preparer 's measurement result in the amplitude - damping noise . our results will be helpful for improving quantum secure communication in real implementation .
