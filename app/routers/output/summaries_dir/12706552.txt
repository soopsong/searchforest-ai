the ability to engineer both linear and non - linear coupling with a mechanical resonator is an important goal for the preparation and investigation of macroscopic mechanical quantum behavior . in this work , a measurement based scheme is presented where linear or square mechanical displacement coupling can be achieved using the optomechanical interaction linearly proportional to the mechanical position . the resulting square displacement measurement strength is compared to that attainable in the dispersive case using the direct interaction to the mechanical displacement squared . an experimental protocol and parameter set are discussed for the generation and observation of non - gaussian states of motion of the mechanical element .
