high - fidelity and robust coherent population transfer is a major challenge in coherent quantum control . different from the well known adiabatic condition , we present a rigorous adiabatic condition that is inspired by the idea of the landau - zener tunneling . based on this , we propose a coherent population transfer approach , which just needs only one control parameter and depends on the eigenvalues of the systems . compared to other approaches , such as fast quasiadiabatic dynamics , shortcut to adiabatic passage , we numerically demonstrate that our approach can provide a more high - fidelity and more robustness coherent population transfer without affecting the speed . in short , our approach opens a new way to further increase the fidelity and the robustness of coherent population transfer . moreover , it may be generalized to complex quantum systems where the exact expressions of eigenstates are difficult to obtain or the paremeters of systems are difficult to simultaneously drive .
