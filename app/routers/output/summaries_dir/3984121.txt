consensus networks are usually understood as arithmetic mean driven dynamical averaging systems . in applications , however , network dynamics often describe inherently non - arithmetic and non - linear consensus processes . in this paper , we propose and study three novel consensus protocols driven by geometric mean averaging : a polynomial , an entropic , and a scaling - invariant protocol , where terminology characterizes the particular non - linearity appearing in the respective differential protocol equation . we prove exponential convergence to consensus for positive initial conditions . for the novel protocols we highlight connections to applied network problems : the polynomial consensus system is structured like a system of chemical kinetics on a graph . the entropic consensus system converges to the weighted geometric mean of the initial condition , which is an immediate extension of the ( weighted ) average consensus problem . we find that all three protocols generate gradient flows of free energy on the simplex of constant mass distribution vectors albeit in different metrics . on this basis , we propose a novel variational characterization of the geometric mean as the solution of a non - linear constrained optimization problem involving free energy as cost function . we illustrate our findings in numerical simulations .
