quantum metrology exploits quantum correlations in specially prepared entangled or other non - classical states to perform measurements that exceed the standard quantum limit . typically though , such states are hard to engineer , particularly when larger numbers of resources are desired . as an alternative , this paper aims to establish quantum jump metrology which is based on generalised sequential measurements as a general design principle for quantum metrology and discusses how to exploit open quantum systems to obtain a quantum enhancement . by analysing a simple toy model , we illustrate that parameter - dependent quantum feedback can indeed be used to exceed the standard quantum limit without the need for complex state preparation .
