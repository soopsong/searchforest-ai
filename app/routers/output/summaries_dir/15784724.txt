in the first half we show an interesting relation between coherent states and the bell states in the case of spin 1/2 , which was suggested by fivel . in the latter half we treat generalized coherent states and try to generalize this relation to get several generalized bell states . our method is based on a geometry and our task may give a hint to open a deep relation between a coherence and an entanglement .
