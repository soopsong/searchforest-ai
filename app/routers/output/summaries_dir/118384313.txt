we study the nonlinear optomechanically - induced transparency ( omit ) with gain and loss . we find that ( i ) for a single active cavity , significant enhancement can be achieved for the higher - order sidebands , including the transmission rate and the group delay ; ( ii ) for active- passive - coupled cavities , hundreds of microsecond of optical delay or advance are attainable for the nonlinear sideband pulses in the parity - time - symmetric regime . the active higher - order omit effects , as firstly revealed here , open up the way to make a low - power optomechaical amplifier , which can amplify both the strength and group delay of not only the probe light but also its higher - order sidebands .
