we present an algorithmic method for the digital quantum simulation of many - body locally indivisible non - markovian open quantum systems . it consists of two parts : firstly , a suzuki - lie - trotter decomposition of the global system propagator into the product of subsystem propagators , which may not be quantum channels , and secondly , an algorithmic procedure for the implementation of the subsystem propagators through unitary operations and measurements on a dilated space . by providing rigorous error bounds for the relevant suzuki - lie - trotter decomposition , we are able to analyze the efficiency of the method , and connect it with an appropriate measure of the local indivisibility of the system . in light of our analysis , the proposed method is expected to be experimentally achievable for a variety of interesting cases .
