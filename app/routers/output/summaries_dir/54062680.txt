we consider the dynamics of a system consisting of two two - level atoms interacting with the electromagnetic field near an optical black hole . we obtain the reduced density operator of the two - atom system in the weak coupling regime for the case that one atom is in the excited state and the other in the ground state . the time evolution of the negativity between the atoms is discussed for two non - resonance and resonance cases . in both cases , we show that the two atoms can become entangled due to the indirect interaction mediated through the optical black hole .
