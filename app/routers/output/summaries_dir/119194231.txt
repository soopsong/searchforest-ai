spatial and/or temporal propagation of light waves in periodic optical structures offers a rather unique possibility to realize in a purely classical setting the optical analogues of a wide variety of quantum phenomena rooted in relativistic wave equations . in this work a brief overview of a few optical analogues of relativistic quantum phenomena , based on either spatial light transport in engineered photonic lattices or on temporal pulse propagation in bragg grating structures , is presented . examples include spatial and temporal photonic analogues of the zitterbewegung of a relativistic electron , klein tunneling , vacuum decay and pair - production , the dirac oscillator , the relativistic kronig - penney model , and optical realizations of non - hermitian extensions of relativistic wave equations .
