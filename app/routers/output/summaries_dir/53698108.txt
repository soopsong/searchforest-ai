this is a short review on an interdisciplinary field of quantum information science and statistical mechanics . we first give a pedagogical introduction to the stabilizer formalism , which is an efficient way to describe an important class of quantum states , the so - called stabilizer states , and quantum operations on them . furthermore , graph states , which are a class of stabilizer states associated with graphs , and their applications for measurement - based quantum computation are also mentioned . based on the stabilizer formalism , we review two interdisciplinary topics . one is the relation between quantum error correction codes and spin glass models , which allows us to analyze the performances of quantum error correction codes by using the knowledge about phases in statistical models . the other is the relation between the stabilizer formalism and partition functions of classical spin models , which provides new quantum and classical algorithms to evaluate partition functions of classical spin models .
