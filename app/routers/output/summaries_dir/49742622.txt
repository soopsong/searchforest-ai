memristors , resistors with memory whose outputs depend on the history of their inputs , have been used with success in neuromorphic architectures , particularly as synapses and non - volatile memories . however , to the best of our knowledge , no model for a network in which both the synapses and the neurons are implemented using memristors has been proposed so far . in the present work we introduce models for single and multilayer perceptrons based exclusively on memristors . we adapt the delta rule to the memristor - based single - layer perceptron and the backpropagation algorithm to the memristor - based multilayer perceptron . our results show that both perform as expected for perceptrons , including satisfying minsky - papert 's theorem . as a consequence of the universal approximation theorem , they also show that memristors are universal function approximators . by using memristors for both the neurons and the synapses , our models pave the way for novel memristor - based neural network architectures and algorithms . a neural network based on memristors could show advantages in terms of energy conservation and open up possibilities for other learning systems to be adapted to a memristor - based paradigm , both in the classical and quantum learning realms .
