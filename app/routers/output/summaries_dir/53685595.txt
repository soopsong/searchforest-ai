we study the spreading of information in a wide class of quantum systems , with variable - range interactions . we show that , after a quench , it generally features a double structure , whose scaling laws are related to a set of universal microscopic exponents that we determine . when the system supports excitations with a finite maximum velocity , the spreading shows a twofold ballistic behavior . while the correlation edge spreads with a velocity equal to twice the maximum group velocity , the dominant correlation maxima propagate with a different velocity that we derive . when the maximum group velocity diverges , as realizable with long - range interactions , the correlation edge features a slower - than - ballistic motion . the motion of the maxima is , instead , either faster - than - ballistic , for gapless systems , or ballistic , for gapped systems . the phenomenology that we unveil here provides a unified framework , which encompasses existing experimental observations with ultracold atoms and ions . it also paves the way to simple extensions of those experiments to observe the structures we describe in their full generality .
