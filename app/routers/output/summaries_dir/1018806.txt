recently , the phenomenon of quantum - classical correspondence breakdown was uncovered in optomechanics , where in the classical regime the system exhibits chaos but in the corresponding quantum regime the motion is regular - there appears to be no signature of classical chaos whatsoever in the corresponding quantum system , generating a paradox . we find that transient chaos , besides being a physically meaningful phenomenon by itself , provides a resolution . using the method of quantum state diffusion to simulate the system dynamics subject to continuous homodyne detection , we uncover transient chaos associated with quantum trajectories . the transient behavior is consistent with chaos in the classical limit , while the long term evolution of the quantum system is regular . transient chaos thus serves as a bridge for the quantum - classical transition ( qct ) . strikingly , as the system transitions from the quantum to the classical regime , the average chaotic transient lifetime increases dramatically ( faster than the ehrenfest time characterizing the qct for isolated quantum systems ) . we develop a physical theory to explain the scaling law .
