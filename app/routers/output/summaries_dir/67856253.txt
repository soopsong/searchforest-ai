how can we arrange $ n$ lines through the origin in three - dimensional euclidean space in a way that maximizes the minimum interior angle between pairs of lines ? conway , hardin and sloane ( 1996 ) produced line packings for $ n \leq 55 $ that they conjectured to be within numerical precision of optimal in this sense , but until now only the cases $ n \leq 7 $ have been solved . in this paper , we resolve the case $ n = 8$. drawing inspiration from recent work on the tammes problem , we enumerate contact graph candidates for an optimal configuration and eliminate those that violate various combinatorial and geometric necessary conditions . the contact graph of the putatively optimal numerical packing of conway , hardin and sloane is the only graph that survives , and we recover from this graph an exact expression for the minimum distance of eight optimally packed points in the real projective plane .
