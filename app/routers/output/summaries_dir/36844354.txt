in the last decade , there has been remarkable progress on the practical integration of on - chip quantum photonic devices yet quantum state generators remain an outstanding challenge . simultaneously , the quantum - dot photonic - crystal - resonator platform has demonstrated a versatility for creating nonclassical light with tunable quantum statistics , thanks to a newly discovered self - homodyning interferometric effect that preferentially selects the quantum light over the classical light when using an optimally tuned fano resonance . in this work , we propose a general structure for the cavity quantum electrodynamical generation of quantum states from a waveguide - integrated version of the quantum - dot photonic - crystal - resonator platform , which is specifically tailored for preferential quantum state transmission . we support our results with rigorous finite - difference time - domain and quantum optical simulations , and show how our proposed device can serve as a robust generator of highly pure single- and even multi - photon states .
