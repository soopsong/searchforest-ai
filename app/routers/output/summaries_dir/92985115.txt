josephson - junction based parametric amplifiers have become a ubiquitous component in superconducting quantum machines . although parametric amplifiers regularly achieve near - quantum limited performance , they have many limitations , including low saturation powers , lack of directionality , and narrow bandwidth . the first is believed to stem from the higher order hamiltonian terms endemic to josephson junction circuits , and the latter two are direct consequences of the nature of the parametric interactions which power them . in this work , we attack both of these issues . first , we have designed a new , linearly shunted josephson ring modulator ( jrm ) which nearly nulls all 4th - order terms at a single flux bias point . next , we achieve gain through a pair of balanced parametric drives . when applied separately , these drives produce phase - preserving gain ( g ) and gainless photon conversion ( c ) , when applied together , the resultant amplifier ( which we term gc ) is a bi - directional , phase - sensitive transmission - only amplifier with a large , gain - independent bandwidth . finally , we have also demonstrated the practical utility of the gc amplifier , as well as its ' quantum efficiency , by using it to read out a superconducting transmon qubit .
