we derive expressions for the invariant length element and measure for the simple compact lie group su(4 ) in a coordinate system particularly suitable for treating entanglement in quantum information processing . using this metric , we compute the invariant volume of the space of two - qubit perfect entanglers . we find that this volume corresponds to more than 84 % of the total invariant volume of the space of two - qubit gates . this same metric is also used to determine the effective target sizes that selected gates will present in any quantum - control procedure designed to implement them .
