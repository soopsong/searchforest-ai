we consider two prototypical quantum models , the spin-1/2 xy chain and the quantum ising chain and study their entanglement entropy , s(l , l ) , of blocks of l spins in homogeneous or inhomogeneous systems of length l. by using two different approaches , free - fermion techniques and perturbational expansion , an exact relationship between the entropies is revealed . using this relation we translate known results between the two models and obtain , among others , the additive constant of the entropy of the critical homogeneous quantum ising chain and the effective central charge of the random xy chain .
