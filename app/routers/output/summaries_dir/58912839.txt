for a fixed average energy , the simultaneous estimation of multiple phases can provide a better total precision than estimating them individually . we show this for a multimode interferometer with a phase in each mode , using gaussian inputs and passive elements , by calculating the covariance matrix . the quantum cram\'{e}r - rao bound provides a lower bound to the covariance matrix via the quantum fisher information matrix , whose elements we derive to be the covariances of the photon numbers across the modes . we prove that this bound can be saturated . in spite of the gaussian nature of the problem , the calculation of non - gaussian integrals is required , which we accomplish analytically . we find our simultaneous strategy to yield no more than a factor - of-2 improvement in total precision , possibly because of a fundamental performance limitation of gaussian states . our work shows that no modal entanglement is necessary for simultaneous quantum - enhanced estimation of multiple phases .
