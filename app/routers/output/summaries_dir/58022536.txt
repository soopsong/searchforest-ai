we define an adaptive routing method for the management of quantum memory failures in the quantum internet . in the quantum internet , the entangled quantum states are stored in the local quantum memories of the quantum nodes . a quantum memory failure in a particular quantum node can destroy several entangled connections in the entangled network . a quantum memory failure event makes the immediate and efficient determination of shortest replacement paths an emerging issue in a quantum internet scenario . the replacement paths omit those nodes that are affected by the quantum memory failure to provide a seamless network transmission . in the proposed solution , the shortest paths are determined by a base - graph , which contains all information about the overlay quantum network . the method provides efficient adaptive routing in quantum memory failure scenarios of the quantum internet . the results can be straightforwardly applied in practical quantum networks , including long - distance quantum communications .
