we study the generation of quantum correlations between two excitonic quantum dot qubits due to their interaction with the same phonon environment . such generation results from the fact that during the pure dephasing process at finite temperatures , each exciton becomes entangled with the phonon environment . we find that for a wide range of temperatures quantum correlations are created due to the interaction . the temperature - dependence of the amount of correlations created displays a trade - off type behaviour ; for small temperatures the phonon - induced distrubance of the qubit states is too small to lead to a distinct change of the two - qubit state , hence , the amount of created correlations is small , while for large temperatures the pure dephasing is not accompanied by the creation of entanglement between the qubits and the environment , so the environment can not mediate qubit - qubit quantum correlations .
