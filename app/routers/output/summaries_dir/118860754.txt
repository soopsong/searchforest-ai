classical point particles in newtonian gravity obey , as they do in general relativity , the universality of free fall . however classical structured particles , ( for instance with a mass quadrupole moment ) , need not obey the universality of free fall . quantum mechanically , an elementary"point"particle ( in the particle physics sense ) can be described by a localized wave - packet , for which we can define a probability quadrupole moment . this probability quadrupole can , under plausible hypotheses , affect the universality of free fall . ( so point - like elementary particles , in the particle physics sense , can and indeed must nevertheless have structure in the general relativistic sense once wave - packet effects are included . ) this raises an important issue of principle , as possible quantum violations of the universality of free fall would fundamentally impact on our ideas of what"quantum gravity"might look like . i will present an estimate of the size of the effect , and discuss where if at all it might be measured .
