in order to find out for which initial states of the system the uncertainty of the measurement outcomes will be minimal , one can look for the minimizers of the shannon entropy of the measurement . in case of group covariant measurements this question becomes closely related to the problem how informative the measurement is in the sense of its informational power . namely , the orbit under group action of the entropy minimizer corresponds to a maximally informative ensemble of equiprobable elements . we give a characterization of such ensembles for 3-dimensional group covariant ( weyl - heisenberg ) sic - povms in both geometric and algebraic terms . it turns out that a maximally informative ensemble arises from the input state orthogonal to a subspace spanned by three linearly dependent vectors defining a sic - povm ( geometrically ) or from an eigenstate of certain weyl 's matrix ( algebraically ) .
