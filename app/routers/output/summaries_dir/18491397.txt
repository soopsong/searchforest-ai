this paper aims to provide conditions under which a quantum stochastic differential equation can serve as a model for interconnection of a bilinear system evolving on an operator group su(2 ) and a linear quantum system representing a quantum harmonic oscillator . to answer this question we derive algebraic conditions for the preservation of canonical commutation relations ( ccrs ) of quantum stochastic differential equations ( qsde ) having a subset of system variables satisfying the harmonic oscillator ccrs , and the remaining variables obeying the ccrs of su(2 ) . then , it is shown that from the physical realizability point of view such qsdes correspond to bilinear - linear quantum cascades .
