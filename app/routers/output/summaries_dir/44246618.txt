traditional quantum error - correcting codes are designed for the depolarizing channel modeled by generalized pauli errors occurring with equal probability . amplitude damping channels model , in general , the decay process of a multilevel atom or energy dissipation of a bosonic system at zero temperature . we discuss quantum error - correcting codes adapted to amplitude damping channels for higher dimensional systems ( qudits ) . for multi - level atoms , we consider a natural kind of decay process , and for bosonic systems , we consider the qudit amplitude damping channel obtained by truncating the fock basis of the bosonic modes to a certain maximum occupation number . we construct families of single - error - correcting quantum codes that can be used for both cases . our codes have larger code dimensions than the previously known single - error - correcting codes of the same lengths . additionally , we present families of multi - error correcting codes for these two channels , as well as generalizations of our construction technique to error - correcting codes for the qutrit $ v$ and $ \lambda$ channels .
