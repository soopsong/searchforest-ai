quantum state tomography is the task of inferring the state of a quantum system from measurement data . a reliable tomography scheme should not only report an estimate for that state , but also well - justified error bars . these may be specified in terms of confidence regions , i.e. , subsets of the state space which contain the system 's state with high probability . here , building upon a quantum generalisation of clopper - pearson confidence intervals -- a notion known from classical statistics -- we present a simple and reliable scheme for generating confidence regions . these have the shape of a polytope and can be computed efficiently . we provide several examples to demonstrate the practical usability of the scheme in experiments .
