the anarchy principle leading to the see - saw ensemble is studied analytically with the usual tools of random matrix theory . the probability density function for the see - saw ensemble of $ n\times n$ matrices is obtained in terms of a multidimensional integral . this integral involves all light neutrino masses , leading to a complicated probability density function . it is shown that the probability density function for the neutrino mixing angles and phases is the appropriate haar measure . the decoupling of the light neutrino masses and neutrino mixings implies no correlation between the neutrino mass eigenstates and the neutrino mixing matrix and leads to a loss of predictive power when comparing with observations . this decoupling is in agreement with some of the claims found in the literature .
