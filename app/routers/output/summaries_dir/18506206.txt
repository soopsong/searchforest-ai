we present theoretical and numerical results on the dynamics of ultracold atoms in an accelerated single- and double - periodic optical lattice . in the single - periodic potential bloch oscillations can be used to generate fast directed transport with very little dispersion . the dynamics in the double - periodic system is dominated by bloch - zener oscillations , i.e. the interplay of bloch oscillations and zener tunneling between the subbands . apart from directed transport , the latter system permits various interesting applications , such as widely tunable matter wave beam splitters and mach - zehnder interferometry . as an application , a method for efficient probing of small nonlinear mean - field interactions is suggested .
