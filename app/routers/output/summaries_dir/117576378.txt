we study the two - qubit rabi model in the most general case where the qubits are different from each other . the spectrum of the system in the ultrastrong - coupling regime is shown to converge to two forced oscillator chains by perturbation theory . an even and odd decomposition of the hilbert space allows us to calculate the spectra in any given parameter regime ; the cases studied confirm our perturbation theory prediction in the ultrastrong - coupling regime and point to crossings in the spectra within each parity subspace in the moderate - coupling regime . the normal modes of the system are calculated by two different methods , the first a linear algebra approach via the parity bases that delivers a four - term recurrence relation for the amplitudes of the proper states and , the second , via bargmann representation for the field that delivers five - term recurrence relations . finally , we show some examples of the time evolution of the mean photon number , population inversion , von neuman entropy and wootters concurrence under the two - qubit quantum rabi hamiltonian by taking advantage of the parity decomposition .
