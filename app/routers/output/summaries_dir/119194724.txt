the robustness properties of bipartite entanglement in systems of n bosons distributed in m different modes are analyzed using a definition of separability based on commuting algebras of observables , a natural choice when dealing with identical particles . within this framework , expressions for the robustness and generalized robustness of entanglement can be explicitly given for large classes of boson states : their entanglement content results in general much more stable than that of distinguishable particles states . using these results , the geometrical structure of the space of n boson states can be explicitly addressed .
