that superpositions of states can be useful for performing tasks in quantum systems has been known since the early days of quantum information , but only recently has quantitative theory of quantum coherence been proposed . here we apply that theory to an analysis of the deutsch - jozsa algorithm , which depends on quantum coherence for its operation . the deutsch - jozsa algorithm solves a decision problem , and we focus on a probabilistic version of that problem , comparing probability of being correct for both classical and quantum procedures . in addition , we study a related decision problem in which the quantum procedure has one - sided error while the classical procedure has two - sided error . the role of coherence on the quantum success probabilities in both of these problems is examined .
