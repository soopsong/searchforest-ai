superconducting detectors are now well - established tools for low - light optics , and in particular quantum optics , boasting high - efficiency , fast response and low noise . similarly , lithium niobate is an important platform for integrated optics given its high second - order nonlinearity , used for high - speed electro - optic modulation and polarization conversion , as well as frequency conversion and sources of quantum light . combining these technologies addresses the requirements for a single platform capable of generating , manipulating and measuring quantum light in many degrees of freedom , in a compact and potentially scalable manner . we will report on progress integrating tungsten transition - edge sensors ( tess ) and amorphous tungsten silicide superconducting nanowire single - photon detectors ( snspds ) on titanium in - diffused lithium niobate waveguides . the travelling - wave design couples the evanescent field from the waveguides into the superconducting absorber . we will report on simulations and measurements of the absorption , which we can characterize at room temperature prior to cooling down the devices . independently , we show how the detectors respond to flood illumination , normally incident on the devices , demonstrating their functionality .
