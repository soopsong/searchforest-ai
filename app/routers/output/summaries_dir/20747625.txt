we extend the quantum jump method to nearly adiabatically driven open quantum systems in a way that allows for an accurate account of the external driving in the system - environment interaction . using this framework , we construct the corresponding trajectory - dependent work performed on the system and derive the integral fluctuation theorem and the jarzynski equality for nearly adiabatic driving . we show that such identities hold as long as the stochastic dynamics and work variable are consistently defined . we numerically study the emerging work statistics for a two - level quantum system and find that the conventional diabatic approximation is unable to capture some prominent features arising from driving such as the continuity of the probability density of work . our results reveal the necessity of using accurate expressions for the drive - dressed heat exchange in future experiments probing jump time distributions .
