for asymptotically periodic systems , a powerful ( phase ) reduction of the dynamics is obtained by computing the so - called isochrons , i.e. the sets of points that converge toward the same trajectory on the limit cycle . motivated by the analysis of excitable systems , a similar reduction has been attempted for non - periodic systems admitting a stable fixed point . in this case , the isochrons can still be defined but they do not capture the asymptotic behavior of the trajectories . instead , the sets of interest - that we call isostables - are defined in literature as the sets of points that converge toward the same trajectory on the stable slow manifold of the fixed point . however , it turns out that this definition of the isostables holds only for systems with slow - fast dynamics . also , efficient methods for computing the isostables are missing . the present paper provides a general framework for the definition and the computation of the isostables of stable fixed points , which is based on the spectral properties of the so - called koopman operator . more precisely , the isostables are defined as the level sets of a particular eigenfunction of the koopman operator . through this approach , the isostables are unique and well - defined objects related to the asymptotic properties of the system . also , the framework reveals that the isostables and the isochrons are two different but complementary notions which define a set of action - angle coordinates for the dynamics . in addition , an efficient algorithm for computing the isostables is obtained , which relies on the evaluation of laplace averages along the trajectories . the method is illustrated with the excitable fitzhugh - nagumo model and with the lorenz model . finally , we discuss how these methods based on the koopman operator framework relate to the global linearization of the system and to the derivation of special lyapunov functions .
