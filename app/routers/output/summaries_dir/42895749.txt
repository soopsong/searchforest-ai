we derive a class of mesoscopic virial equations governing energy partition between conjugate position and momentum variables of individual degrees of freedom . they are shown to apply to a wide range of nonequilibrium steady states with stochastic ( langevin ) and deterministic ( nos\'e -- hoover ) dynamics , and to extend to collective modes for models of heat - conducting lattices . a generalised macroscopic virial theorem ensues upon summation over all degrees of freedom . this theorem allows for the derivation of nonequilibrium state equations that involve dissipative heat flows on the same footing with state variables , as exemplified for inertial brownian motion with solid friction and overdamped active brownian particles subject to inhomogeneous pressure .
