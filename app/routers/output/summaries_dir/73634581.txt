quantum mechanics and general relativity have been extensively and independently confirmed in many experiments . however , the interplay of the two theories has never been tested : all experiments that measured the influence of gravity on quantum systems are consistent with non - relativistic , newtonian gravity . on the other hand , all tests of general relativity can be described within the framework of classical physics . here we discuss a quantum interference experiment with single photons that can probe quantum mechanics in curved space - time . we consider a single photon travelling in superposition along two paths in an interferometer , with each arm experiencing a different gravitational time dilation . if the difference in the time dilations is comparable with the photon 's coherence time , the visibility of the quantum interference is predicted to drop , while for shorter time dilations the effect of gravity will result only in a relative phase shift between the two arms . we discuss what aspects of the interplay between quantum mechanics and general relativity are probed in such experiments and analyze the experimental feasibility .
