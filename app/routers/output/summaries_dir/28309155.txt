engineering a sensor system for detecting an extremely tiny signal such as the gravitational - wave force is a very important subject in quantum physics . a major obstacle to this goal is that , in a simple detection setup , the measurement noise is lower bounded by the so - called standard quantum limit ( sql ) , which is originated from the intrinsic mechanical back - action noise . hence , the sensor system has to be carefully engineered so that it evades the back - action noise and eventually beats the sql . in this paper , based on the well - developed geometric control theory for classical disturbance decoupling problem , we provide a general method for designing an auxiliary ( coherent feedback or direct interaction ) controller for the sensor system to achieve the above - mentioned goal . this general theory is applied to a typical opto - mechanical sensor system . also , we demonstrate a controller design for a practical situation where several experimental imperfections are present .
