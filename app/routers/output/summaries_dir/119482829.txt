although key distribution is arguably the most studied context on which to apply quantum cryptographic techniques , message authentication , i.e. , certifying the identity of the message originator and the integrity of the message sent , can also benefit from the use of quantum resources . classically , message authentication can be performed by techniques based on hash functions . however , the security of the resulting protocols depends on the selection of appropriate hash functions , and on the use of long authentication keys . in this paper we propose a quantum authentication procedure that , making use of just one qubit as the authentication key , allows the authentication of binary classical messages in a secure manner .
