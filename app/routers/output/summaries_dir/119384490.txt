the exact optical response of quantum few - level systems depends crucially on the exact choice of the incoming pulse areas . we use four - wave mixing ( fwm ) spectroscopy to infer the coherent response and dynamics of single inas quantum dots ( qds ) and study their pulse area dependence . by combining atomic force microscopy with fwm hyperspectral imaging , we show that the retrieved fwm signals originate from individual qds enclosed in natural photonic defects . the optimized light - matter coupling in these defects allows us to perform our studies in a wide range of driving field amplitudes . when varying the pulse areas of the exciting laser pulses the so - called rabi rotations can be resolved by the two - pulse fwm technique . we investigate these rabi rotations within two- and three - level systems , both theoretically and experimentally , and explain their damping by the coupling to acoustic phonons . to highlight the importance of the pulse area influence , we show that the phonon - induced dephasing of qd excitons depends on the pulse intensity .
