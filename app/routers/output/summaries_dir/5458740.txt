we consider the problem of determining the state of a quantum system given one or more readings of the expectation value of an observable . the system is assumed to be a finite dimensional quantum control system for which we can influence the dynamics by generating all the unitary evolutions in a lie group . we investigate to what extent , by an appropriate sequence of evolutions and measurements , we can obtain information on the initial state of the system . we present a system theoretic viewpoint of this problem in that we study the { \it observability } of the system . in this context , we characterize the equivalence classes of indistinguishable states and propose algorithms for state identification .
