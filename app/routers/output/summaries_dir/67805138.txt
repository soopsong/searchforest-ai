we provide a comprehensive impossibility result towards achieving string stability , i.e. keeping local relative errors in check with local controllers independently of the size of a chain of subsystems . we significantly extend existing results , from the lti setting to any homogeneous controllers that can be nonlinear , time - varying , and locally communicating . we prove this impossibility for a set of definitions with various norm choices , including the $ l_2$-type which is more standard in the literature and a bibo type criterion . all results hold for a general discrete - time controller which should cover most applications .
