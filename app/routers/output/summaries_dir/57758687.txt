numerical investigations are an important research tool in quantum information theory . there already exists a wide range of computational tools for quantum information theory implemented in various programming languages . however , there is little effort in implementing this kind of tools in the julia language . julia is a modern programming language designed for numerical computation with excellent support for vector and matrix algebra , extended type system that allows for implementation of elegant application interfaces and support for parallel and distributed computing . quantuminformation.jl is a new quantum information theory library implemented in julia that provides functions for creating and analyzing quantum states , and for creating quantum operations in various representations . an additional feature of the library is a collection of functions for sampling random quantum states and operations such as unitary operations and generic quantum channels .
