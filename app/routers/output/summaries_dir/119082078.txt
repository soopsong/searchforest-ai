long - time average behavior of quantum correlations in a multi - qubit system , collectively modeled as a kicked top , is addressed here . the behavior of dynamical generation of quantum correlations such as entanglement , discord , concurrence , as previously studied , and bell correlation function and tangle , as identified in this study , is a function of initially localized coherent states . their long - time average reproduces coarse - grained classical phase space structures of the kicked top which contrast , often starkly , chaotic and regular regions . apart from providing numerical evidence of such correspondence in the semiclassical regime of a large number of qubits , we use data from a recent transmons based experiment to explore this in the deep quantum regime of a 3-qubit kicked top . the degree to which quantum correlations can be regarded as a quantum signature of chaos , and in what ways the various correlation measures are similar or distinct are discussed .
