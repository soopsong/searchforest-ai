in this paper , we study the stabilization problem of quantum spin-1/2 systems under continuous - time measurements . in the case without feedback , we show exponential stabilization around the excited and ground state by providing a lower bound of the convergence rate . based on stochastic lyapunov techniques , we propose a parametrized measurement - based feedback which ensures exponential convergence toward the excited state . moreover , we give a lower bound of the convergence rate for this case . then , we discuss the effect of each parameter appeared in the control law in the convergence rate . finally , we illustrate the efficiency of such feedback law through simulations .
