we derive a monogamy inequality for entanglement and local contextuality , for any finite bipartite system . it essentially results from the relations between the purity of a local state and the entanglement of the global state , and between the purity of a state and its ability to violate a given noncontextuality inequality . we build an explicit entanglement monotone that satisfies the found monogamy inequality . an important consequence of this inequality , is that there are global states too entangled to violate the local noncontextuality inequality .
