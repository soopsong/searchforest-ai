we analyse the evolution of the entanglement of a non - trivial initial quantum field state ( which , for simplicity , has been taken to be a bipartite state made out of vacuum and the first excited state ) when it undergoes a gravitational collapse . we carry out this analysis by generalising the tools developed to study entanglement behaviour in stationary scenarios and making them suitable to deal with dynamical spacetimes . we also discuss what kind of problems can be tackled using the formalism spelled out here as well as single out future avenues of research .
