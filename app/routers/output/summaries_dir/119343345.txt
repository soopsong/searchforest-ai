entangled quantum states , such as n00n states , are of major importance for quantum technologies due to their quantum - enhanced performance . at the same time , their quantum correlations are relatively vulnerable when they are subjected to imperfections . therefore , it is crucial to determine under which circumstances their distinct quantum features can be exploited . in this paper , we study the entanglement property of noisy n00n states . this class of states is a generalization of n00n states including various attenuation effects , such as mixing , constant or fluctuating losses , and dephasing . to verify their entanglement , we pursue two strategies : detection - based entanglement witnesses and entanglement quasiprobabilities . both methods result from our solution of so - called separability eigenvalue equations . in particular , the entanglement quasiprobabilities allow for a full entanglement characterization . as examples of our general treatment , the cases of n00n states subjected to gaussian dephasing and fluctuating atmospheric losses are explicitly studied . in any correlated fluctuating loss channel , entanglement is found to survive for non - zero transmissivity . in addition , an extension of our approach to multipartite systems is given , and the relation to the quantum - optical nonclassicality in phase - space is discussed .
