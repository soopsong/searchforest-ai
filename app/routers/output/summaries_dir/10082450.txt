for n an even number of qubits and v a unitary evolution , a matrix decomposition v = k1 a k2 of the unitary group is explicitly computable and allows for study of the dynamics of the concurrence entanglement monotone . the side factors k1 and k2 of this concurrence canonical decomposition ( ccd ) are concurrence symmetries , so the dynamics reduce to consideration of the a factor . in this work , we provide an explicit numerical algorithm computing v = k1 a k2 for n odd . further , in the odd case we lift the monotone to a two - argument function , allowing for a theory of concurrence dynamics in odd qubits . the generalization may also be studied using the ccd , leading again to maximal concurrence capacity for most unitaries . the key technique is to consider the spin - flip as a time reversal symmetry operator in wigner 's axiomatization ; the original ccd derivation may be restated entirely in terms of this time reversal . en route , we observe a kramers ' nondegeneracy : the existence of a nondegenerate eigenstate of any time reversal symmetric n - qubit hamiltonian demands ( i ) n even and ( ii ) maximal concurrence of said eigenstate . we provide examples of how to apply this work to study the kinematics and dynamics of entanglement in spin chain hamiltonians .
