a complex projective $ t$-design is a configuration of vectors which is ` ` evenly distributed ' ' on a sphere in the sense that sampling uniformly from it reproduces the moments of haar measure up to order $ 2t$. we show that the set of all $ n$-qubit stabilizer states forms a complex projective $ 3$-design in dimension $ 2^n$. stabilizer states had previously only been known to constitute $ 2$-designs . the main technical ingredient is a general recursion formula for the so - called frame potential of stabilizer states . to establish it , we need to compute the number of stabilizer states with pre - described inner product with respect to a reference state . this , in turn , reduces to a counting problem in discrete symplectic vector spaces for which we find a simple formula . we sketch applications in quantum information and signal analysis .
