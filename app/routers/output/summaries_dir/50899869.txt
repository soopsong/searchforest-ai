recent experiments on a one - dimensional chain of trapped alkali atoms [ arxiv:1707.04344 ] have observed a quantum transition associated with the onset of period-3 ordering of pumped rydberg states . this spontaneous $ \mathbb{z}_3 $ symmetry breaking is described by a constrained model of hard - core bosons proposed by fendley $ et\ , \,al.$ [ arxiv : cond - mat/0309438 ] . by symmetry arguments , the transition is expected to be in the universality class of the $ \mathbb{z}_3 $ chiral clock model with parameters preserving both time - reversal and spatial - inversion symmetries . we study the nature of the order - disorder transition in these models , and numerically calculate its critical exponents with exact diagonalization and density - matrix renormalization group techniques . we use finite - size scaling to determine the dynamical critical exponent $ z$ and the correlation length exponent $ \nu$. our analysis presents the only known instance of a strongly - coupled transition between gapped states with $ z \ne 1 $ , implying an underlying nonconformal critical field theory .
