we propose a quantum inverse iteration algorithm which can be used to estimate the ground state properties of a programmable quantum device . the method relies on the inverse power iteration technique , where the sequential application of the hamiltonian inverse to an initial state prepares an approximate groundstate . to apply the inverse hamiltonian operation , we write it as a sum of unitary evolution operators using the fourier approximation approach . this allows to reformulate the protocol as separate measurements for the overlap of initial and propagated wavefunction . the algorithm thus crucially depends on the ability to run hamiltonian dynamics with an available quantum device . we benchmark the performance using paradigmatic examples of quantum chemistry , corresponding to molecular hydrogen and beryllium hydride . finally , we show its use for studying the ground state properties of relevant material science models which can be simulated with existing devices , considering an example of the bose - hubbard atomic simulator .
