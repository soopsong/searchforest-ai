time has a fundamentally different character in quantum mechanics and in general relativity . in quantum theory events unfold in a fixed time order while in general relativity temporal order is influenced by the distribution of matter . when the distribution of matter requires a quantum description , temporal order is expected to become non - classical -- a scenario beyond the scope of current theories . here we provide a direct description of such a scenario . we consider a massive body in a spatial superposition and show how it leads to"entanglement"of temporal orders between time - like events in the resulting space - time . this entanglement enables accomplishing a task , violation of a bell inequality , that is impossible under classical temporal order . violation of the inequality means that temporal order becomes non - classical -- it can not be described by locally defined classical variables . our approach provides a quantitative method for investigating quantum aspects of space - time and gravity .
