we derived quantum trajectories for a system interacting with the environment prepared in a continuous mode single photon state as the limit of discrete filtering model with an environment defined as series of independent qubits prepared initially in the entangled state being an analogue of a continuous mode state . the environment qubits interact with the quantum system and they are subsequently measured . the initial correlation between the bath qubits is the source of the non - markovianity . the conditional evolutions of the quantum system for limit of the continuous in time observations together with the formulas for the photon counting probabilities are given .
