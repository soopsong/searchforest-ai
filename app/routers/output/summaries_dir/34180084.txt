there are at least three models of discrete - time quantum walks ( qws ) on graphs currently under active development . in this work we focus on the equivalence of two of them , known as szegedy 's and staggered qws . we give a formal definition of the staggered model and discuss generalized versions for searching marked vertices . using this formal definition , we prove that any instance of szegedy 's model is equivalent to an instance of the staggered model . on the other hand , we show that there are instances of the staggered model that can not be cast into szegedy 's framework . our analysis also works when there are marked vertices . we show that szegedy 's spatial search algorithms can be converted into search algorithms in staggered qws . we take advantage of the similarity of those models to define the quantum hitting time in the staggered model and to describe a method to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the evolution operator of staggered qws .
