for systems of identical bosons , it is necessary to reformulate the notions of separability and entanglement in algebraic terms shifting the emphasis from the particle aspect of first quantization to the mode description typical of second quantization . within this new framework , we show that , unlike for systems consisting of distinguishable qubits , negativity is an exhaustive bipartite entanglement witness for systems with fixed number of bosons ; further , we investigate the impact of dephasing noise in relation to the use of such many - body bosonic systems in metrological applications .
