it is known that actions of field theories on a noncommutative space - time can be written as some modified ( we call them $ \theta$-modified ) classical actions already on the commutative space - time ( introducing a star product ) . then the quantization of such modified actions reproduces both space - time noncommutativity and usual quantum mechanical features of the corresponding field theory . the $ \theta$-modification for arbitrary finite - dimensional nonrelativistic system was proposed by deriglazov ( 2003 ) . in the present article , we discuss the problem of constructing $ \theta$-modified actions for relativistic qm . we construct such actions for relativistic spinless and spinning particles . the key idea is to extract $ \theta$-modified actions of the relativistic particles from path integral representations of the corresponding noncommtative field theory propagators . we consider klein - gordon and dirac equations for the causal propagators in such theories . then we construct for the propagators path - integral representations . effective actions in such representations we treat as $ \theta$-modified actions of the relativistic particles . to confirm the interpretation , we quantize canonically these actions . thus , we obtain the klein - gordon and dirac equations in the noncommutative field theories . the $ \theta$-modified action of the relativistic spinning particle is just a generalization of the berezin - marinov pseudoclassical action for the noncommutative case .
