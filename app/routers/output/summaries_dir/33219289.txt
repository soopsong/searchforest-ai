unitary $ k$-designs are finite ensembles of unitary matrices that approximate the haar distribution over unitary matrices . several ensembles are known to be 2-designs , including the uniform distribution over the clifford group , but no family of ensembles was previously known to form a 3-design . we prove that the clifford group is a 3-design , showing that it is a better approximation to haar - random unitaries than previously expected . our proof strategy works for any distribution of unitaries satisfying a property we call pauli 2-mixing and proceeds without the use of heavy mathematical machinery . we also show that the clifford group does not form a 4-design , thus characterizing how well random clifford elements approximate haar - random unitaries . additionally , we show that the generalized clifford group for qudits is not a 3-design unless the dimension of the qudit is a power of 2 .
