in this paper we consider projected entangled pair states ( peps ) on arbitrary lattices . we construct local parent hamiltonians for each peps and isolate a condition under which the state is the unique ground state of the hamiltonian . this condition , verified by generic peps and examples like the aklt model , is an injective relation between the boundary and the bulk of any local region . while it implies the existence of an energy gap in the 1d case we will show that in certain cases ( e.g. , on a 2d hexagonal lattice ) the parent hamiltonian can be gapless with a critical ground state . to show this we invoke a mapping between classical and quantum models and prove that in these cases the injectivity relation between boundary and bulk solely depends on the lattice geometry .
