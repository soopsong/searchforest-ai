we study single silicon vacancy ( siv ) centres in chemical vapour deposition ( cvd ) nanodiamonds on iridium as well as an ensemble of siv centres in a high quality , low stress cvd diamond film by using temperature dependent luminescence spectroscopy in the temperature range 5 - 295 k. we investigate in detail the temperature dependent fine structure of the zero - phonon - line ( zpl ) of the siv centres . the zpl transition is affected by inhomogeneous as well as temperature dependent homogeneous broadening and blue shifts by about 20 cm-1 upon cooling from room temperature to 5 k. we employ excitation power dependent g(2 ) measurements to explore the temperature dependent internal population dynamics of single siv centres and infer almost temperature independent dynamics .
