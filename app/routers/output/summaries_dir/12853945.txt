two - photon loss mechanisms often accompany a kerr nonlinearity . the kinetic inductance exhibited by superconducting transmission lines provides an example of a kerr - like nonlinearity that is accompanied by a nonlinear resistance of the two - photon absorptive type . such nonlinear dissipation can degrade the performance of amplifiers and mixers employing a kerr - like nonlinearity as the gain or mixing medium . as an aid for parametric - amplifier design , the authors provide a quantum analysis of a cavity parametric amplifier employing a kerr nonlinearity that is accompanied by a two - photon absorptive loss . because of their usefulness in diagnostics , we obtain expressions for the pump amplitude within the cavity , the reflection coefficient for the pump amplitude reflected off of the cavity , the parametric gain , and the intermodulation gain . expressions by which the degree of squeezing can be computed are also presented . although the focus here is on providing aids for the design of kinetic - inductance parametric amplifiers , much of what is presented is directly applicable to analogous optical and mechanical amplifiers
