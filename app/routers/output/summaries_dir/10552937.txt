the spatial self - organization of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a high - finesse linear optical cavity is discussed . the condensate atoms are laser - driven from the side and scatter photons into the cavity . above a critical pump intensity the homogeneous condensate evolves into a stable pattern bound by the cavity field . the transition point is determined analytically from a mean - field theory . we calculate the lowest lying bogoliubov excitations of the coupled bec - cavity system and the quantum depletion due to the atom - field coupling .
