we study a model of repeated interaction between quantum systems which can be thought of as a non - commutative markov chain . it is shown that there exists an outgoing cuntz scattering system associated to this model which induces an input - output formalism with a transfer function corresponding to a multi - analytic operator , in the sense of multivariate operator theory . finally we show that observability for this system is closely related to the scattering theory of non - commutative markov chains .
