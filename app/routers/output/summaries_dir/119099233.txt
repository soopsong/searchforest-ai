in a measurement - device - independent or quantum - refereed protocol , a referee can verify whether two parties share entanglement or einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) steering without the need to trust either of the parties or their devices . the need for trusting a party is substituted by a quantum channel between the referee and that party , through which the referee encodes the measurements to be performed on that party 's subsystem in a set of non - orthogonal quantum states . in this work , an epr - steering inequality is adapted as a quantum - refereed epr - steering witness , and the trust - free experimental verification of higher dimensional quantum steering is reported via preparing a class of entangled photonic qutrits . further , with two measurement settings , we extract $ 1.106\pm0.023 $ bits of private randomness from our observed data , which surpasses the one - bit limit for qubit systems . our results advance research on quantum information processing tasks beyond qubits .
