the destruction of quantum interference , decoherence , and the destruction of entanglement both appear to occur under the same circumstances . to address the connection between these two phenomena , we consider the evolution of arbitrary initial states of a two - particle system under open system dynamics described by a class of master equations which produce decoherence of each particle . we show that all initial states become separable after a finite time , and we produce the explicit form of the separated state . the result extends and amplifies an earlier result of di\'osi . we illustrate the general result by considering the case in which the initial state is an epr state ( in which both the positions and momenta of a particle pair are perfectly correlated ) . this example clearly illustrates how the spreading out in phase space produced by the environment leads to certain disentanglement conditions becoming satisfied .
