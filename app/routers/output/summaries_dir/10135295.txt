the concept of transparent and opaque horizons is defined . one example of opaqueness is the presence of a firewall . two apparently contradictory statements are reconciled : the overwhelming number of black hole states have opaque horizons ; and : all black holes formed by natural processes have transparent horizons . a diagnostic is proposed for transparency , namely that the computational complexity of the state be increasing with time . it is shown that opaque horizons are extremely unstable and that the slightest perturbation will make them transparent within a scrambling time .
