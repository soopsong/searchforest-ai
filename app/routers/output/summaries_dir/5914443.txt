conceptual memristors have recently gathered wider interest due to their diverse application in non - von neumann computing , machine learning , neuromorphic computing , and chaotic circuits . we introduce a compact cmos circuit that emulates idealized memristor characteristics and can bridge the gap between concepts to chip - scale realization by transcending device challenges . the cmos memristor circuit embodies a two - terminal variable resistor whose resistance is controlled by the voltage applied across its terminals . the memristor ' state ' is held in a capacitor that controls the resistor value . this work presents the design and simulation of the memristor emulation circuit , and applies it to a memcomputing application of maze solving using analog parallelism . furthermore , the memristor emulator circuit can be designed and fabricated using standard commercial cmos technologies and opens doors to interesting applications in neuromorphic and machine learning circuits .
