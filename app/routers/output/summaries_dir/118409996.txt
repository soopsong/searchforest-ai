we propose a scheme for inverse engineering control in open quantum systems . starting from an undetermined time evolution operator , a time - dependent hamiltonian is derived in order to guide the system to attain an arbitrary target state at a predefined time . we analyze the fidelity of our control protocol under noise with respect to the stochastic fluctuation of the linear parameters of the hamiltonian during the time evolution . for a special family of hamiltonians for two - level systems , we show that the control evolution of the system under noise can be categorized into two standard decohering processes : dephasing and depolarization , for both markovian and non- markovian conditions . in particular , we illustrate our formalism by analysing the robustness of the engineered target state .
