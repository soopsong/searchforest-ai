robust control design for quantum systems has been recognized as a key task in the development of practical quantum technology . in this paper , we present a systematic numerical methodology of sampling - based learning control ( slc ) for control design of quantum systems with uncertainties . the slc method includes two steps of"training"and"testing " . in the training step , an augmented system is constructed using artificial samples generated by sampling uncertainty parameters according to a given distribution . a gradient flow based learning algorithm is developed to find the control for the augmented system . in the process of testing , a number of additional samples are tested to evaluate the control performance where these samples are obtained through sampling the uncertainty parameters according to a possible distribution . the slc method is applied to three significant examples of quantum robust control including state preparation in a three - level quantum system , robust entanglement generation in a two - qubit superconducting circuit and quantum entanglement control in a two - atom system interacting with a quantized field in a cavity . numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the slc approach even when uncertainties are quite large , and show its potential for robust control design of quantum systems .
