we propose a general framework for investigating a large class of stabilization problems in markovian quantum systems . building on the notions of invariant and attractive quantum subsystem , we characterize attractive subspaces by exploring the structure of the invariant sets for the dynamics . our general analysis results are exploited to assess the ability of open - loop hamiltonian and output - feedback control strategies to synthesize markovian generators which stabilize a target subsystem , subspace , or pure - state . in particular , we provide an algebraic characterization of the manifold of stabilizable pure states in arbitrary finite - dimensional markovian systems , that leads to a constructive strategy for designing the relevant controllers . implications for stabilization of entangled pure states are addressed by example .
