this matlab program calculates the dynamics of the reduced density matrix of an open quantum system modeled by the feynman - vernon model . the user gives the program a vector describing the coordinate of an open quantum system , a hamiltonian matrix describing its energy , and a spectral distribution function and temperature describing the environment 's influence on it , in addition to the open quantum system 's intial density matrix and a grid of times . with this , the program returns the reduced density matrix of the open quantum system at all ( or some ) moments specified by that grid of times . this overall calculation can be divided into two stages : the setup of the feynman integral , and the actual calculation of the feynman integral for time - propagation of the density matrix . when this program calculates this propagation on a multi - core cpu , it is this propagation that is usually the rate limiting step of the calculation , but when it is calculated on a gpu , the propagation is calculated so quickly that the setup of the feynman integal actually becomes the rate limiting step for most cases tested so far . the overhead of transfrring information from the cpu to the gpu and back seems to have negligible effect on the overall runtime of the program . when the required information can not fit on the gpu , the user can choose to run the entire program on a cpu .
