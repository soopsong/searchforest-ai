we have studied the effect of a non - hermitian bosonic bath on the dynamics of a two - level spin system . the non - hermitian hamiltonian of the bath is chosen such that it converges to the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian when the non - hermiticity is switched off . we calculate the dynamics of the spin system and found that the non - hermiticity can have positive as well as negative effects on the coherence of the system . however , the decoherence can be completely eliminated by choosing the non - hermiticity parameter and the phase of the system bath interaction appropriately . we have also studied the effect of this bath on the entanglement of a two - spin system when the bath is acting only on one spin .
