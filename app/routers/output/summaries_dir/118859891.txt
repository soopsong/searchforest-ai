we describe nonlinear quantum atom - light interfaces and nonlinear quantum metrology in the collective continuous variable formalism . we develop a nonlinear effective hamiltonian in terms of spin and polarization collective variables and show that model hamiltonians of interest for nonlinear quantum metrology can be produced in $ ^{87}$rb ensembles . with these hamiltonians , metrologically relevant atomic properties , e.g. the collective spin , can be measured better than the"heisenberg limit"$\propto 1 / n$. in contrast to other proposed nonlinear metrology systems , the atom - light interface allows both linear and non - linear estimation of the same atomic quantities .
