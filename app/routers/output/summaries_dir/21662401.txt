the quantum dynamics of the coupling between a cavity optical field and a resonator microwave field via the electro - optic effect is studied . this coupling has the same form as the opto - mechanical coupling via radiation pressure , so all previously considered opto - mechanical effects can in principle be observed in electro - optic systems as well . in particular , i point out the possibilities of laser cooling of the microwave mode , entanglement between the optical mode and the microwave mode via electro - optic parametric amplification , and back - action - evading optical measurements of a microwave quadrature .
