we show that the two problems of computing the permanent of an $ n\times n$ matrix of $ \operatorname{poly}(n)$-bit integers and counting the number of hamiltonian cycles in a directed $ n$-vertex multigraph with $ \operatorname{exp}(\operatorname{poly}(n))$ edges can be reduced to relatively few smaller instances of themselves . in effect we derive the first deterministic algorithms for these two problems that run in $ o(2^n)$ time in the worst case . classic $ \operatorname{poly}(n)2^n$ time algorithms for the two problems have been known since the early 1960 's . our algorithms run in $ 2^{n-\omega(\sqrt{n/\log n})}$ time .
