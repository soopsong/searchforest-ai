recently normalized laplacian matrices of graphs are studied as density matrices in quantum mechanics . separability and entanglement of density matrices are important properties as they determine the nonclassical behavior in quantum systems . in this note we look at the graphs whose normalized laplacian matrices are separable or entangled . in particular , we show that the number of such graphs is related to the number of 0 - 1 matrices that are line sum symmetric and to the number of graphs with at least one vertex of degree 1 .
