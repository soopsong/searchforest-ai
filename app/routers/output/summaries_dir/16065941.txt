we show that motion and gravity affect the precision of quantum clocks . we consider a localised quantum field as a fundamental model of a quantum clock moving in spacetime and show that its state is modified due to changes in acceleration . by computing the quantum fisher information we determine how relativistic motion modifies the ultimate bound in the precision of the measurement of time . while in the absence of motion the squeezed vacuum is the ideal state for time estimation , we find that it is highly sensitive to the motion - induced degradation of the quantum fisher information . we show that coherent states are generally more resilient to this degradation and that in the case of very low initial number of photons , the optimal precision can be even increased by motion . these results can be tested with current technology by using superconducting resonators with tunable boundary conditions .
