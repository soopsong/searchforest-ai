the thermal duality of e(8 ) x e(8 ) and so(32 ) heterotic string theories may underpin a mechanism that would convert the kinetic energy of infalling matter during gravitational collapse to form a region of a hot string phase that would expel gravitational gradients . this phase would be the continuation of a ginzburg - landau like superconductor in the euclidean regime . in this scenario , there would be no event horizon or singularity produced in gravitational collapse . solutions are presented for excitations of the string vacuum that may form during gravitational collapse and drive the transition to the hot phase . the proposed mechanism is developed here for the case of approximately spherical gravitational collapse in 4 uncompactified spacetime dimensions . a way to reconcile the large entropy apparently produced in this process with quantum mechanics is briefly discussed . in this scenario , astrophysical objects such as stellar or galactic cores which have undergone extreme gravitational collapse would currently be sites of an on - going conversion process to shells of this high temperature phase . the relationship of this proposal to the ` firewall paradox ' is noted .
