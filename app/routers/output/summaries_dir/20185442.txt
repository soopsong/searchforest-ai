the effects of photon bunching and antibunching correspond to the classical and quantum features of the electromagnetic field , respectively . no direct evidence suggests whether these effects can be potentially related to quantum entanglement . here we design a cavity quantum electrodynamics model with two atoms trapped in to demonstrate the connections between the steady - state photon statistics and the two - atom entanglement . it is found that within the weak dissipations and to some good approximation , the local maximal two - atom entanglements perfectly correspond to not only the quantum feature of the electromagnetic field --- the optimal photon antibunching , but also the classical feature --- the optimal photon bunching . we also analyze the influence of strong dissipations and pure dephasing . an intuitive physical understanding is also given finally .
