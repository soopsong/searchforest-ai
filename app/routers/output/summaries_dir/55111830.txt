the interaction of a cavity with an external field is symmetric under time reversal . thus , coupling to a resonator is most efficient when the incident light is the time reversed version of a free cavity decay , i.e. when it has a rising exponential shape matching the cavity lifetime . for light entering the cavity from only one side , the maximally achievable coupling efficiency is limited by the choice of the cavity mirrors ' reflectivities . such an empty - cavity experiment serves also as a model system for single - photon single - atom absorption dynamics . we present experiments coupling exponentially rising pulses to a cavity system which allows for high coupling efficiencies . the influence of the time constant of the rising exponential is investigated as well as the effect of a finite pulse duration . we demonstrate coupling 94 % of the incident tem00 mode into the resonator .
