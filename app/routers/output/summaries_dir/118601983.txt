we investigate the relationship between multipartite entanglement and symmetry , focusing on permutation symmetric states . we use the majorana representation , where these states correspond to points on a sphere . symmetry of the representation under rotation is equivalent to symmetry of the states under products of local unitaries . the geometric measure of entanglement is thus phrased entirely as a geometric optimisation , and a condition for the equivalence of entanglement measures written in terms of point symmetries . finally we see that different symmetries of the states correspond to different types of entanglement with respect to slocc interconvertibility .
