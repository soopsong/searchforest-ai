we propose a superconducting circuit - atom hybrid , where the rabi oscillation of single excess cooper pair in the island is stabilized via the common atomic - clock technique . the noise in the superconducting circuit is mapped onto the voltage source which biases the cooper - pair box via an inductor and a gate capacitor . the fast fluctuations of the gate charge are significantly suppressed by an inductor - capacitor resonator , leading to a long - relaxation - time rabi oscillation . more importantly , the residual low - frequency fluctuations are further reduced by using the general feedback - control method , in which the voltage bias is stabilized via continuously measuring the dc - stark - shift - induced atomic ramsey signal . the stability and coherence time of the resulting charge - qubit rabi oscillation are both enhanced . the principal structure of this cooper - pair - box oscillator is studied in detail .
