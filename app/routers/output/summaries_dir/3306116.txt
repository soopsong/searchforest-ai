we have laser cooled 3$\times10 ^ 6 $ $ ^{87}$rb atoms to 3$\mu$k in a micro - fabricated grating magneto - optical trap ( gmot ) , enabling future mass - deployment in highly accurate compact quantum sensors . we magnetically trap the atoms , and use larmor spin precession for magnetic sensing in the vicinity of the atomic sample . finally , we demonstrate an array of magneto - optical traps with a single laser beam , which will be utilised for future cold atom gradiometry .
