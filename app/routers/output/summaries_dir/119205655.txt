we investigate the role of quantum coherence depletion ( qcd ) in grover search algorithm ( ga ) by using several typical measures of quantum coherence and quantum correlations . by using the relative entropy of coherence measure ( $ \mathcal{c}_r$ ) , we show that the success probability depends on the qcd . the same phenomenon is also found by using the $ l_1 $ norm of coherence measure ( $ \mathcal{c}_{l_1}$ ) . in the limit case , the cost performance is defined to characterize the behavior about qcd in enhancing the success probability of ga , which is only related to the number of searcher items and the scale of database , no matter using $ \mathcal{c}_r$ or $ \mathcal{c}_{l_1}$. in generalized grover search algorithm ( gga ) , the qcd for a class of states increases with the required optimal measurement time . in comparison , the quantification of other quantum correlations in ga , such as pairwise entanglement , multipartite entanglement , pairwise discord and genuine multipartite discord , can not be directly related to the success probability or the optimal measurement time . additionally , we do not detect pairwise nonlocality or genuine tripartite nonlocality in ga since clauser - horne - shimony - holt inequality and svetlichny 's inequality are not violated .
