we compute the total amount of entanglement produced between momentum modes at late times after a smooth mass quench in free bosonic and fermionic quantum field theories . the entanglement and r\'enyi entropies are obtained in closed form as a function of the parameters characterizing the quench protocol . for bosons , we show that the entanglement production is more significant for light modes and for fast quenches . in particular , infinitely slow or adiabatic quenches do not produce any entanglement . depending on the quench profile , the decrease as a function of the quench rate $ \delta t$ can be either monotonic or oscillating . in the fermionic case the situation is subtle and there is a critical value for the quench amplitude above which this behavior is changed and the entropies become peaked at intermediate values of momentum and of the quench rate . we also show that the results agree with the predictions of a generalized gibbs ensemble and obtain explicitly its parameters in terms of the quench data .
