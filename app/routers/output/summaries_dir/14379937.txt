we give a quantum algorithm for solving semidefinite programs ( sdps ) . it has worst - case running time $ n^{\frac{1}{2 } } m^{\frac{1}{2 } } s^2 \text{poly}(\log(n ) , \log(m ) , r , r , 1/\delta)$ , with $ n$ and $ s$ the dimension and row - sparsity of the input matrices , respectively , $ m$ the number of constraints , $ \delta$ the accuracy of the solution , and $ r , r$ a upper bounds on the size of the optimal primal and dual solutions . this gives a square - root unconditional speed - up over any classical method for solving sdps both in $ n$ and $ m$. we prove the algorithm can not be substantially improved ( in terms of $ n$ and $ m$ ) giving a $ \omega(n^{\frac{1}{2}}+m^{\frac{1}{2}})$ quantum lower bound for solving semidefinite programs with constant $ s , r , r$ and $ \delta$. the quantum algorithm is constructed by a combination of quantum gibbs sampling and the multiplicative weight method . in particular it is based on a classical algorithm of arora and kale for approximately solving sdps . we present a modification of their algorithm to eliminate the need for solving an inner linear program which may be of independent interest .
