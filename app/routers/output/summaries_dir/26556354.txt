we consider frequency control of synchronous generator networks and study transient performance under both primary and secondary frequency control . we model random step changes in power loads and evaluate performance in terms of expected deviations from a synchronous frequency over the synchronization transient ; what can be thought of as lack of frequency coherence . we compare a standard droop control strategy to two secondary proportional integral ( pi ) controllers : centralized averaging pi control ( capi ) and dis- tributed averaging pi control ( dapi ) . we show that the performance of a power system with dapi control is always superior to that of a capi controlled system , which in turn has the same transient performance as standard droop control . furthermore , for a large class of network graphs , performance scales unfavorably with network size with capi and droop control , which is not the case with dapi control . we discuss optimal tuning of the dapi controller and describe how inter- nodal alignment of the integral states affects performance . our results are demonstrated through simulations of the nordic power grid .
