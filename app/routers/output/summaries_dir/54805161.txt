we focus on a recently experimentally realized scenario of normal - metal - insulator - superconductor tunnel junctions coupled to a superconducting resonator . we develop a first - principles theory to describe the effect of photon - assisted electron tunneling on the quantum state of the resonator . our results are in very good quantitative agreement with the previous experiments on refrigeration and heating of the resonator using the photon - assisted tunneling , thus providing a stringent verification of the developed theory . importantly , our results provide simple analytical estimates of the voltage - tunable coupling strength and temperature of the thermal reservoir formed by the photon - assisted tunneling . consequently , they are used to introduce optimization principles for initialization of quantum devices using such a quantum - circuit refrigerator . thanks to the first - principles nature of our approach , extension of the theory to the full spectrum of quantum electric devices seems plausible .
