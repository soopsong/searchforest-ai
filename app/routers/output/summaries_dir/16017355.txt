we consider how to connect a set of disjoint networks to optimize the performance of the resulting composite network . we quantify this performance by the coherence of the composite network , which is defined by an $ h_2 $ norm of the system . two dynamics are considered : noisy consensus dynamics with and without stubborn agents . for noisy consensus dynamics without stubborn agents , we derive analytical expressions for the coherence of composite networks in terms of the coherence of the individual networks and the structure of their interconnections . we also identify optimal interconnection topologies and give bounds on coherence for general composite graphs . for noisy consensus dynamics with stubborn agents , we develop a non - combinatorial algorithm that identifies connecting edges such that the composite network coherence closely approximates the performance of the optimal composite graph .
