achieving high - fidelity control of quantum systems is of fundamental importance in physics , chemistry and quantum information sciences . however , the successful implementation of a high - fidelity quantum control scheme also requires robustness against control field fluctuations . here , we demonstrate a robust optimization method for control of quantum systems by optimizing the spectral phase of an ultrafast laser pulse , which is accomplished in the framework of frequency domain quantum optimal control theory . by incorporating a filtering function of frequency into the optimization algorithm , our numerical simulations in an abstract two - level quantum system as well as in a three - level atomic rubidium show that the optimization procedure can be enforced to search optimal solutions while achieving remarkable robustness against the control field fluctuations , providing an efficient approach to optimize the spectral phase of the ultrafast laser pulse to achieve a desired final quantum state of the system .
