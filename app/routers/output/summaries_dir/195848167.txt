we show the relation between the heisenberg averaging of regularized two - points out - of - time ordered correlation function and the two - points spectral form factor in bosonic quantum mechanics . the generalization to all even - points is also discussed . we also do the direct extension from the bosonic quantum mechanics to the non - interacting scalar field theory through the oscillator languages . finally , we find that the coherent state and large-$n$ approaches are useful in the late - time study . we find that the computation of the coherent state can be simplified by the heisenberg averaging . therefore , this provides a simplified way to probe the late - time quantum chaos through a coherent state . the large-$n$ result is also comparable to the $ n=3 $ numerical result in the large-$n$ quantum mechanics . this can justify that large-$n$ technique in bosonic quantum mechanics can really probe the late time , not the early time . because the quantitative behavior of large-$n$ can be captured from the $ n=3 $ numerical result , the realization in experiments should be possible .
