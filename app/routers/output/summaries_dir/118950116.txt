we prove a new kind of quantum de finetti theorem for representations of the unitary group u(d ) . consider a pure state that lies in the irreducible representation u_{mu+nu } for young diagrams mu and nu . u_{mu+nu } is contained in the tensor product of u_mu and u_nu ; let xi be the state obtained by tracing out u_nu . we show that xi is close to a convex combination of states uv , where u is in u(d ) and v is the highest weight vector in u_mu . when u_{mu+nu } is the symmetric representation , this yields the conventional quantum de finetti theorem for symmetric states , and our method of proof gives near - optimal bounds for the approximation of xi by a convex combination of product states . for the class of symmetric werner states , we give a second de finetti - style theorem ( our ' half ' theorem ) ; the de finetti - approximation in this case takes a particularly simple form , involving only product states with a fixed spectrum . our proof uses purely group theoretic methods , and makes a link with the shifted schur functions . it also provides some useful examples , and gives some insight into the structure of the set of convex combinations of product states .
