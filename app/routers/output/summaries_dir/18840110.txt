optical nanofibers provide a rich platform for exploring atomic and optical phenomena even when they support only a single spatial mode . nanofibers supporting higher - order modes provide additional degrees of freedom to enable complex evanescent field profiles for interaction with the surrounding medium , but local control of these profiles requires nondestructive evaluation of the propagating fields . here , we use rayleigh scattering for rapid measurement of the propagation of light in few - mode optical nanofibers . imaging the rayleigh scattered light provides direct visualization of the spatial evolution of propagating fields throughout the entire fiber , including the transition from core - cladding guidance to cladding - air guidance . we resolve the interference between higher - order modes to determine local beat lengths and modal content along the fiber , and show that the modal superposition in the waist can be systematically controlled by adjusting the input superposition . with this diagnostic we can measure variations in the radius of the fiber waist to below 3 nm in situ using purely optical means . this nondestructive technique also provides useful insight into light propagation in optical nanofibers .
