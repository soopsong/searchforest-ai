number - phase uncertainty relations are formulated in terms of unified entropies which form a family of two - parametric extensions of the shannon entropy . for two generalized measurements , unified - entropy uncertainty relations are given in both the state - dependent and state - independent forms . a few examples are discussed as well . using the pegg -- barnett formalism and the riesz theorem , we obtain a nontrivial inequality between norm - like functionals of generated probability distributions in finite dimensions . the principal point is that we take the infinite - dimensional limit right for this inequality . hence number - phase uncertainty relations with finite phase resolutions are expressed in terms of the unified entropies . especially important case of multiphoton coherent states is separately considered . we also give some entropic bounds in which the corresponding integrals of probability density functions are involved .
