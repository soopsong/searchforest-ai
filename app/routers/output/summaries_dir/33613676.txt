we introduce a probability current analysis of excitation energy transfer between states of an open quantum system . expressing the energy transfer through currents of excitation probability between the states in a site representation enables us to gain key insights into the energy transfer dynamics . it allows to , i ) identify the pathways of energy transport in large networks of sites and to quantify their relative weights , ii ) quantify the respective contributions of unitary dynamics , dephasing , and relaxation / dissipation processes to the energy transfer , and iii ) quantify the contribution of coherence to the energy transfer . our analysis is general and can be applied to a broad range of open quantum system descriptions ( with coupling to non - markovian environments ) in a straightforward manner .
