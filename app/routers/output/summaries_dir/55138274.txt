photonic qubits constitute a leading platform to disruptive quantum technologies due to their unique low - noise properties . the cost of the photonic approach is the non - deterministic nature of many of the processes , including single - photon generation , which arises from parametric sources and negligible interaction between photons . active temporal multiplexing - repeating a generation process in time and rerouting to single modes using an optical switching network - is a promising approach to overcome this challenge and will likely be essential for large - scale applications with greatly reduced resource complexity and system sizes . requirements include the precise synchronization of a system of low - loss switches , delay lines , fast photon detectors , and feed - forward . here we demonstrate temporal multiplexing of 8 ' bins ' from a double - passed heralded photon source and observe an increase in the heralding and heralded photon rates . this system points the way to harnessing temporal multiplexing in quantum technologies , from single - photon sources to large - scale computation .
