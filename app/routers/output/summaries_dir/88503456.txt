quantum measurements disturb the quantum system being measured , and this is known as measurement - induced backaction . in this work , we consider a double quantum dot monitored by a nearby quantum point contact where the measurement - induced backaction plays an important role . taking advantage of the quantum master equation approach , we calculate the tunnelling current , and propose a simple feedbackcontrol law to realize and stabilize the tunnelling current . theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that the feedback control law can make the current quickly convergent to the desired value .
