the quantum permutation algorithm provides computational speed - up over classical algorithms in determining the parity of a given cyclic permutation . for its $ n$-qubit implementations , the number of required quantum gates scales quadratically with $ n$ due to the quantum fourier transforms included . we show here for the $ n$-qubit case that the algorithm can be simplified so that it requires only $ o(n)$ quantum gates , which theoretically reduces the complexity of the implementation . in order to test our results experimentally , we utilize ibm 's $ 5$-qubit quantum processor to realize the algorithm by using the original and simplified recipes for the $ 2$-qubit case . it turns out that the latter results in a significantly higher success probability which allows us to verify the algorithm more precisely than the previous experimental realizations . we also verify the algorithm for the first time for the $ 3$-qubit case with a considerable success probability by taking the advantage of our simplified scheme .
