we generate photon pairs in a - si : h microrings using a cw pump , and find the kerr coefficient of a - si : h to be $ 3.73 \pm 0.25 \times 10^{-17}m^2 / w$. by measuring the q factor with coupled power we find that the loss in the a - si : h micro - rings scales linearly with power , and therefore can not originate from two photon absorption . theoretically comparing a - si : h and c - si micro - ring pair sources , we show that the high kerr coefficient of this sample of a - si : h is best utilized for microrings with q factors below $ 10 ^ 3 $ , but that for higher q factor devices the photon pair rate is greatly suppressed due to the first order loss .
