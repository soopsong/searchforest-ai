it is shown that a nonclassicality witness , whose expectation value can be measured for all quantum states , can be constructed from every nonclassicality filter . this finding leads to a set of universal witnesses , parameterized by only three real numbers , for the detection of nonclassicality of any quantum state of a harmonic oscillator . an explicit operator expression is given for such a universal witness . the application of the witnesses is demonstrated for a nontrivial example , and its experimental measurement is briefly considered .
