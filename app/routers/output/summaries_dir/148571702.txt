recently , a novel kind of hybrid atom - optomechanical system , consisting of atoms in a lattice coupled to a membrane , has been experimentally realized [ vochezer { \it et al . , } phys . rev . lett . \textbf{120 } , 073602 ( 2018 ) ] , which promises a viable contender in the competitive field of simulating non - equilibrium many - body physics . here we are motivated to investigate a spinor bose gas coupled to a vibrational mode of a nano - membrane , focusing on analyzing the role of the spinor degrees of freedom therein . through an adiabatic elimination of the degrees of freedom of the quantum oscillator , we derive an effective hamiltonian which reveals a competition between the force localizing the atoms and the membrane displacement . we analyze the dynamical stability of the steady state using bogoliubov - de gennes approach and derive the stationary phase diagram in the parameter space . we investigate the non - equilibrium quantum phase transition from a localized symmetric state of the atom cloud to a shifted symmetry - broken state , where we present a detailed analysis of the effects of the spin degree of freedom . our work presents a simple way to study the effects of the spinor degree of freedom on the non - equilibrium nonlinear phenomena that is complementary to ongoing experiments on the hybrid atom - optomechanical system .
