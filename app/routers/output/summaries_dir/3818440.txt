using a femtosecond laser writing technique , we fabricate and characterise three - waveguide digital adiabatic passage devices , with the central waveguide digitised into five discrete waveguidelets . strongly asymmetric behaviour was observed , devices operated with high fidelity in the counter - intuitive scheme while strongly suppressing transmission in the intuitive . the low differential loss of the digital adiabatic passage designs potentially offers additional functionality for adiabatic passage based devices . these devices operate with a high contrast ( $ > \!90\%$ ) over a 60 nm bandwidth , centered at $ \sim 823$nm .
