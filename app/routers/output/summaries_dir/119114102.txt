in this paper we introduce a design for an optical topological cluster state computer constructed exclusively from a single quantum component . unlike previous efforts we eliminate the need for on demand , high fidelity photon sources and detectors and replace them with the same device utilised to create photon / photon entanglement . this introduces highly probabilistic elements into the optical architecture while maintaining complete specificity of the structure and operation for a large scale computer . photons in this system are continually recycled back into the preparation network , allowing for a arbitrarily deep 3d cluster to be prepared using a comparatively small number of photonic qubits and consequently the elimination of high frequency , deterministic photon sources .
