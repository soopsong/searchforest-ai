in this article we analyze the optimal control strategy for rotating a monitored qubit from an initial pure state to an orthogonal state in minimum time . this strategy is described for two different cost functions of interest which do not have the usual regularity properties . hence , as classically smooth cost functions may not exist , we interpret these functions as viscosity solutions to the optimal control problem . specifically we prove their existence and uniqueness in this weak - solution setting . in addition , we also give bounds on the time optimal control to prepare any pure state from a mixed state .
