we study the controllable single - photon scattering via a one - dimensional waveguide which is coupled to a two - level emitter and a single - mode cavity simultaneously . the emitter and the cavity are also coupled to each other and form a three - level system with cyclic transitions . as a result , the phase of emitter - cavity coupling strength serves as a sensitive control parameter . when the emitter and cavity locate at the same point of the waveguide , we demonstrate the rabi splitting and quasidark - state -- induced perfect transmission for the incident photons . more interestingly , when they locate at different points of the waveguide , a controllable nonreciprocal transmission can be realized . furthermore , we demonstrate that our theoretical model is experimentally feasible with currently available technologies .
