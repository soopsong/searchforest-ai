technological realities limit terrestrial quantum key distribution ( qkd ) to single - link distances of a few hundred kilometers . one promising avenue for global - scale quantum communication networks is to use low - earth - orbit satellites . here we report the first demonstration of qkd from a stationary transmitter to a receiver platform traveling at an angular speed equivalent to a 600 km altitude satellite , located on a moving truck . we overcome the challenges of actively correcting beam pointing , photon polarization and time - of - flight . our system generates an asymptotic secure key at 40 bits / s .
