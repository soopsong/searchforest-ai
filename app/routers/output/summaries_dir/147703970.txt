the interplay of spin angular momentum and thermal radiation is a frontier area of interest to nanophotonics as well as topological physics . here , we show that a thick planar slab of a nonreciprocal material , despite being at thermal equilibrium with its environment , can exhibit nonzero photon spin angular momentum and nonzero radiative heat flux in its vicinity . we identify them as the persistent thermal photon spin ( ptps ) and the persistent planar heat current ( pphc ) respectively . with a practical example system , we reveal that the fundamental origin of these phenomena is connected to spin - momentum locking of thermally excited evanescent waves . we also discover spin magnetic moment of surface polaritons in nonreciprocal photonics that further clarifies these features . we then propose a novel thermal photonic imaging experiment based on brownian motion that allows one to witness these surprising features by directly looking at them using a lab microscope . we further demonstrate the universal behavior of these near - field thermal radiation phenomena through a comprehensive analysis of gyroelectric , gyromagnetic and magneto - electric nonreciprocal materials . together , these results expose a surprisingly little explored research area of thermal spin photonics with prospects for new avenues related to non - hermitian topological photonics and radiative heat transport .
