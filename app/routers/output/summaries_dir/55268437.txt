we analyze the polarization of a quantum radiation field under a de - gaussification process . specifically , we consider the addition of photons to a two - mode thermal state to get mixed non - gaussian and nonclassical states which are still diagonal in the fock basis . stokes - operator - based degrees of polarization and two distance - type measures defined with hilbert - schmidt and bures metrics are investigated . for a better insight we here introduce a polarization degree based on the relative entropy . polarization of the thermal states is fully investigated and simple closed expressions are found for all the defined degrees . the evaluated degrees for photon - added states are then compared to the corresponding ones for the two - mode thermal states they originate from . we present interesting findings which tell us that some popular degrees of polarization are not fully consistent . however , the most solidly defined degrees , which are based on the bures metric and relative entropy , clearly indicate an enhancement of polarization through de - gaussification . this conclusion is supported by the behavior of the degrees of polarization of the fock states , which are finally discussed as a limit case .
