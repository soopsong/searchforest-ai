one way to study the physical plausibility of closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) is to examine their computational power . this has been done for deutschian ctcs ( d - ctcs ) and post - selection ctcs ( p - ctcs ) , with the result that they allow for the efficient solution of problems in pspace and pp , respectively . since these are extremely powerful complexity classes , which are not expected to be solvable in reality , this can be taken as evidence that these models for ctcs are pathological . this problem is closely related to the nonlinearity of this models , which also allows for example cloning quantum states , in the case of d - ctcs , or distinguishing non - orthogonal quantum states , in the case of p - ctcs . in contrast , the process matrix formalism allows one to model indefinite causal structures in a \emph{linear } way , getting rid of these effects , and raising the possibility that its computational power is rather tame . in this paper we show that process matrices correspond to a linear particular case of p - ctcs , and therefore that its computational power is upperbounded by that of pp . we show , furthermore , a family of processes that can violate causal inequalities but nevertheless can be simulated by a causally ordered quantum circuit with only a constant overhead , showing that indefinite causality is not necessarily hard to simulate .
