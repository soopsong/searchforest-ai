one of the limitation of continuous variable quantum key distribution is relatively short transmission distance of secure keys . in order to overcome the limitation , some solutions have been proposed such as reverse reconciliation , trusted noise concept , and non - gaussian operation . in this paper , we propose a protocol using photon subtraction at receiver which utilizes synergy of the aforementioned properties . by simulations , we show performance of the proposed protocol outperforms other conventional protocols . we also find the protocol is more efficient in a practical case . finally , we provide a guide for provisioning a system based on the protocol through an analysis for noise from a channel .
