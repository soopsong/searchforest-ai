is the hawking flux"thermal " ? unfortunately , the answer to this seemingly innocent question depends on a number of often unstated , but quite crucial , technical assumptions built into modern ( mis-)interpretations of the word"thermal " . the original 1850 's notions of thermality --- based on classical thermodynamic reasoning applied to idealized"black bodies"or"lamp black surfaces"--- when supplemented by specific basic quantum ideas from the early 1900 's , immediately led to the notion of the black - body spectrum , ( the planck - shaped spectrum ) , but"without"any specific assumptions or conclusions regarding correlations between the quanta . many ( not all ) modern authors ( often implicitly and unintentionally ) add an extra , and quite unnecessary , assumption that there are no correlations in the black - body radiation ; but such usage is profoundly ahistorical and dangerously misleading . specifically , the hawking flux from an evaporating black hole , ( just like the radiation flux from a leaky furnace or a burning lump of coal ) , is only"approximately"planck - shaped over a bounded frequency range . standard physics ( phase space and adiabaticity effects ) explicitly bound the frequency range over which the hawking flux is"approximately"planck - shaped from both above and below --- the hawking flux is certainly not exactly planckian , and there is no compelling physics reason to assume the hawking photons are uncorrelated .
