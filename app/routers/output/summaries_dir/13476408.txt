a reversible logic has application in quantum computing . a reversible logic design needs resources such as ancilla and garbage qubits to reconfigure circuit functions or gate functions . the removal of garbage qubits and ancilla qubits are essential in designing an efficient quantum circuit . in the literature , there are multiple designs that have been proposed for a reversible multiplication operation . a multiplication hardware is essential for the circuit design of quantum algorithms , quantum cryptanalysis , and digital signal processing ( dsp ) applications . the existing designs of reversible quantum integer multipliers suffer from redundant garbage qubits . in this work , we propose a reversible logic based , garbage - free and ancilla qubit optimized design of a quantum integer multiplier . the proposed quantum integer multiplier utilizes a novel add and rotate methodology that is specially suitable for a reversible computing paradigm . the proposed design methodology is the modified version of a conventional shift and add method . the proposed design of the quantum integer multiplier incorporates add or no operation based on multiplier qubits and followed by a rotate right operation . the proposed design of the quantum integer multiplier produces zero garbage qubits and shows an improvement ranging from 60 % to 90 % in ancilla qubits count over the existing work on reversible quantum integer multipliers .
