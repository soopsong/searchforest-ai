the unavoidable interaction of quantum systems with their environment usually results in the loss of desired quantum resources . suitably chosen system hamiltonians , however , can , to some extent , counteract such detrimental decay , giving rise to the set of stabilizable states . here , we discuss the possibility to stabilize gaussian states in continuous - variable systems . we identify necessary and sufficient conditions for such stabilizability and elaborate these on two benchmark examples , a single , damped mode and two locally damped modes . the obtained stabilizability conditions , which are formulated in terms of the states ' covariance matrices , are , more generally , also applicable to non - gaussian states , where they may similarly help to , e.g. , discuss entanglement preservation and/or detection up to the second moments .
