we consider the continuous - time quantum walk defined on the adjacency matrix of a graph . at each instant , the walk defines a mixing matrix which is doubly - stochastic . the average of the mixing matrices contains relevant information about the quantum walk and about the graph . we show that it is the matrix of transformation of the orthogonal projection onto the commutant algebra of the adjacency matrix , restricted to diagonal matrices . using this formulation of the average mixing matrix , we find connections between its rank and automorphisms of the graph .
