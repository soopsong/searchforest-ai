directional transmission or amplification of microwave signals is indispensable in various applications involving sensitive measurements . in this work we show in experiment how to use a generic cavity optomechanical setup to non - reciprocally amplify microwave signals above 3 ghz in one direction by 9 decibels , and simultaneously attenuate the transmission in the opposite direction by 21 decibels . we use a device including two on - chip superconducting resonators and two metallic drumhead mechanical oscillators . application of four microwave pump tone frequencies allows for designing constructive or destructive interference for a signal tone depending on the propagation direction . the device can also be configured as an isolator with a lossless nonreciprocal transmission and 18 db of isolation .
