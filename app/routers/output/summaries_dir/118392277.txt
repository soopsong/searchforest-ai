the presence of symmetries , be they discrete or continuous , in a physical system typically leads to a reduction in the problem to be solved . here we report that neither translational invariance nor rotational invariance reduce the computational complexity of simulating hamiltonian dynamics ; the problem is still bqp complete , and is believed to be hard on a classical computer . this is achieved by designing a system to implement a universal quantum interface , a device which enables control of an entire computation through the control of a fixed number of spins , and using it as a building - block to entirely remove the need for control , except in the system initialisation . finally , it is shown that cooling such hamiltonians to their ground states in the presence of random magnetic fields solves a qma - complete problem .
