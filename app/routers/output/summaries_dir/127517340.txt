this paper proposes a multi - mode gaussian modulated continuous variable quantum key distribution ( cv - qkd ) scheme able to operate at high bandwidth despite using conventional noisy , coherent detectors . we demonstrate enhancement in shotnoise sensitivity as well as reduction in the electronic noise variance of the coherent receiver of the multi - mode cv - qkd system . a proof - of - concept simulation is presented using multiple modes ; this demonstrates an increase in signal - to - noise ratio and secure key rate at various transmission distances with increasing signal modes .
