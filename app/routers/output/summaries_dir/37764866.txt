we study procedures for the optimization of efficiency of light storage and retrieval based on the dynamic form of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in warm rb vapor . we present a detailed analysis of two recently demonstrated optimization protocols : a time - reversal - based iteration procedure , which finds the optimal input signal pulse shape for any given control field , and a procedure based on the calculation of an optimal control field for any given signal pulse shape . we verify that the two procedures are consistent with each other , and that they both independently achieve the maximum memory efficiency for any given optical depth . we observe good agreement with theoretical predictions for moderate optical depths ( < 25 ) , while at higher optical depths the experimental efficiency falls below the theoretically predicted values . we identify possible effects responsible for this reduction in memory efficiency .
