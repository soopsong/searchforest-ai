we consider an algorithm to approximate complex - valued periodic functions $ f(e^{i\theta})$ as a matrix element of a product of $ su(2)$-valued functions , which underlies so - called quantum signal processing . we prove that the algorithm runs in time $ \mathcal o(n^3 \mathrm{polylog}(n/\epsilon))$ under the random - access memory model of computation where $ n$ is the degree of the polynomial that approximates $ f$ with accuracy $ \epsilon$ ; previous efficiency claim assumed a strong arithmetic model of computation and lacked numerical stability analysis .
