the redfield equation describes the dynamics of a quantum system weakly coupled to one or more reservoirs and is widely used in theory of open quantum system . however , the assumption of weak system - reservoir coupling is often not fully adequate and higher - order corrections to the redfield equation with respect to the system - bath coupling is required . here we propose a general method of derivation of higher - order corrections to the redfield quantum master equation based on the hierarchical equations of motion ( heom ) . also we derive conditions of validity of the redfield equation as well as the additional secular approximation for it .
