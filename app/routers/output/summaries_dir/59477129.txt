we study a nonlinear interferometer consisting of two consecutive parametric amplifiers , where all three optical fields ( pump , signal and idler ) are treated quantum mechanically , allowing for pump depletion and other quantum phenomena . the interaction of all three fields in the final amplifier leads to an interference pattern from which we extract the phase uncertainty . we find that the phase uncertainty oscillates around a saturation level that decreases as the mean number $ n$ of input pump photons increases . for optimal interaction strengths , we also find a phase uncertainty below the shot - noise level and obtain a heisenberg scaling $ 1 / n$. this is in contrast to the conventional treatment within the parametric approximation , where the heisenberg scaling is observed as a function of the number of down - converted photons inside the interferometer .
