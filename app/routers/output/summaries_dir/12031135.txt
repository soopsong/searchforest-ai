we consider a physical system with a coupling to bosonic reservoirs via a quantum stochastic differential equation . we study the limit of this model as the coupling strength tends to infinity . we show that in this limit the solution to the quantum stochastic differential equation converges strongly to the solution of a limit quantum stochastic differential equation . in the limiting dynamics the excited states are removed and the ground states couple directly to the reservoirs .
