in this paper we study the possibility of modifying the dynamics of both quantum correlations , such as entanglement and discord , and classical correlations of an open bi - partite system by means of the quantum zeno effect . we consider two qubits coupled to a common boson reservoir at zero temperature . this model describes , for example , two atoms interacting with a quantized mode of a lossy cavity . we show that , when the frequencies of the two atoms are symmetrically detuned from that of the cavity mode , oscillations between zeno and anti - zeno regimes occur . we also calculate analytically the time evolution of both classical correlations and quantum discord , and we compare the zeno dynamics of entanglement with the zeno dynamics of classical correlations and discord .
