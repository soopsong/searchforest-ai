we study quantum state transfer between two qubits coupled to a common quantum bus that is constituted by an ultrastrong coupled light - matter system . by tuning both qubit frequencies on resonance with a forbidden transition in the mediating system , we demonstrate a high - fidelity swap operation even though the quantum bus is thermally populated . this proposal may have applications on hot quantum information processing within the context of ultrastrong coupling regime of light - matter interaction .
