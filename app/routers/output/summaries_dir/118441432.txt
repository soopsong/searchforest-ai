using hodge diagram combinatorial data , we study qubit and fermionic fock spaces from the point of view of type ii superstring black holes based on complex compactifications . concretely , we establish a one - to - one correspondence between qubits , fermionic spaces and extremal black holes in maximally supersymmetric supergravity obtained from type ii superstring on complex toroidal and calabi - yau compactifications . we interpret the differential forms of the n - dimensional complex toroidal compactification as states of n - qubits encoding information on extremal black hole charges . we show that there are 2^n copies of n - qubit systems which can be split as 2^n=2^{n-1}+2^{n-1 } . more precisely , 2^{n-1 } copies are associated with even d - brane charges in type iia superstring and the other 2^{n-1 } ones correspond to odd d - brane charges in iib superstring . this correspondence is generalized to a class of calabi - yau manifolds . in connection with black hole charges in type iia superstring , an n - qubit system has been obtained from a canonical line bundle of n factors of one dimensional projective space \mathbb{cp}^1 .
