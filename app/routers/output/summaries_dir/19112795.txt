the turaev - viro invariants are scalar topological invariants of three - dimensional manifolds . here we show that the problem of estimating the fibonacci version of the turaev - viro invariant of a mapping torus is a complete problem for the one clean qubit complexity class ( dqc1 ) . this complements a previous result showing that estimating the turaev - viro invariant for arbitrary manifolds presented as heegaard splittings is a complete problem for the standard quantum computation model ( bqp ) . we also discuss a beautiful analogy between these results and previously known results on the computational complexity of approximating the jones polynomial .
