in this paper , we study the feasibility of conducting quantum key distribution ( qkd ) together with classical communication through the same optical fiber by employing dense - wavelength - division - multiplexing ( dwdm ) technology at telecom wavelength . the impact of the classical channels to the quantum channel has been investigated for both qkd based on single photon detection and qkd based on homodyne detection . our studies show that the latter can tolerate a much higher level of contamination from the classical channels than the former . this is because the local oscillator used in the homodyne detector acts as a"mode selector"which can suppress noise photons effectively . we have performed simulations based on both the decoy bb84 qkd protocol and the gaussian modulated coherent state ( gmcs ) qkd protocol . while the former can not tolerate even one classical channel ( with a power of 0dbm ) , the latter can be multiplexed with 38 classical channels ( 0dbm power each channel ) and still has a secure distance around 10 km . preliminary experiment has been conducted based on a 100mhz bandwidth homodyne detector .
