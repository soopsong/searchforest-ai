assuming spherical symmetry and the semi - classical einstein equation , we prove that , for the observers on top of the trapping horizon , the vacuum energy - momentum tensor is always that of an ingoing negative energy flux at the speed of light with a universal energy density $ { \cal e } \simeq - 1/(2\kappa a^2)$ , ( where $ a$ is the areal radius of the trapping horizon ) , which is responsible for the decrease in the black hole 's mass over time . this result is independent of the composition of the collapsing matter and the details of the vacuum energy - momentum tensor . the physics behind the universality of this quantity $ { \cal e}$ and its surprisingly large magnitude will be discussed .
