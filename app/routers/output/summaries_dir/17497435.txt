quantum teleportation circumvents the uncertainty principle using dual channels : a quantum one consisting of previously - shared entanglement , and a classical one , together allowing the disembodied transport of an unknown quantum state over distance . it has recently been shown that a classical bit can be counterfactually communicated between two parties in empty space,"alice"and"bob " . here , by using our"dual"version of the chained quantum zeno effect to achieve a counterfactual cnot gate , we propose the first protocol for transporting an unknown qubit counterfactually , that is without any physical particles travelling between alice and bob - no classical channel and no previously - shared entanglement .
