in this work we aim at quantifying quantum channel output similarity . in order to achieve this , we introduce the notion of quantum channel superfidelity , which gives us an upper bound on the quantum channel fidelity . this quantity is expressed in a clear form using the kraus representation of a quantum channel . as examples , we show potential applications of this quantity in the quantum control field .
