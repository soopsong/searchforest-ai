we study the entanglement entropy in a relativistic quantum field theory for regions which are not included in a single spatial hyperplane . this geometric configuration can not be treated with the euclidean time method and the replica trick . instead , we use a real time method to calculate the entropy for a massive free dirac field in two dimensions in some approximations . we find some specifically relativistic features of the entropy . first , there is a large enhancement of entanglement due to boosts . as a result , the mutual information between relatively boosted regions does not vanish in the limit of zero volume and large relative boost . we also find extensivity of the information in a deeply lorentzian regime with large violations of the triangle inequalities for the distances . this last effect is relevant to an interpretation of the amount of entropy enclosed in the hawking radiation emitted by a black hole .
