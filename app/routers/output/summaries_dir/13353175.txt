we provide a scheme for efficient simulation of a broad class of quantum optics experiments . our efficient simulation extends the continuous variable gottesman - knill theorem to a large class of non - gaussian mixed states , thereby identifying that these non - gaussian states are not an enabling resource for exponential quantum speed - up . our results also provide an operationally motivated interpretation of negativity as non - classicality . we apply our scheme to the case of noisy single - photon - added - thermal - states to show that this class admits states with positive wigner function but negative p -function that are not useful resource states for quantum computation .
