we propose and demonstrate an effective mode - filtering technique of non - gaussian states generated by photon - subtraction . more robust non - gaussian states have been obtained by removing noisy low frequencies from the original mode spectrum . we show that non - gaussian states preserve their non - classicality after quantum teleportation to a higher degree , when they have been mode - filtered . this is indicated by a stronger negativity $ -0.033 \pm 0.005 $ of the wigner function at the origin , compared to $ -0.018 \pm 0.007 $ for states that have not been mode - filtered . this technique can be straightforwardly applied to various kinds of photon - subtraction protocols , and can be a key ingredient in a variety of applications of non - gaussian states , especially teleportation - based protocols towards universal quantum information processing .
