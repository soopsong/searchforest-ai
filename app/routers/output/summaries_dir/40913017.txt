the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) system , which describes the interaction between a cavity and a two - level atom , is one of the most important systems in quantum optics . we obtain analytic solutions for the one- and two - photon transport in a waveguide side - coupled to the jc system using input - output formalism in fock space . with these results , we discuss the conditions under which the jc system functions as a photon switch for waveguide photons in both the strong and weak coupling regimes
