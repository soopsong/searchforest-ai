we consider the problem of optimally decoding a quantum error correction code -- that is to find the optimal recovery procedure given the outcomes of partial"check"measurements on the system . in general , this problem is np - hard . however , we demonstrate that for concatenated block codes , the optimal decoding can be efficiently computed using a message passing algorithm . we compare the performance of the message passing algorithm to that of the widespread blockwise hard decoding technique . our monte carlo results using the 5 qubit and steane 's code on a depolarizing channel demonstrate significant advantages of the message passing algorithms in two respects . 1 ) optimal decoding increases by as much as 94 % the error threshold below which the error correction procedure can be used to reliably send information over a noisy channel . 2 ) for noise levels below these thresholds , the probability of error after optimal decoding is suppressed at a significantly higher rate , leading to a substantial reduction of the error correction overhead .
