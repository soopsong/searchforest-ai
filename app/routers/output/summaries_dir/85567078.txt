using optimal control theory ( oct ) , we design fast ramps for the controlled transport of bose - einstein condensates with atom chips ' magnetic traps . these ramps are engineered in the context of precision atom interferometry experiments and support transport over large distances , typically of the order of 1 mm , i.e. about 1,000 times the size of the atomic clouds , yet with durations not exceeding 200 ms . we show that with such transport durations of the order of the trap period , one can recover the ground state of the final trap at the end of the transport . the performance of the oct procedure is compared to that of a shortcut - to - adiabaticity ( sta ) protocol and the respective advantages / disadvantages of the oct treatment over the sta one are discussed .
