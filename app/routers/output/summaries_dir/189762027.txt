in this paper , we present explicit description on the additive characters , multiplicative characters and gauss sums over a local ring . as an application , based on the additive characters and multiplicative characters satisfying certain conditions , two new constructions of complex codebooks over a local ring are introduced . with these two constructions , we obtain two families of codebooks achieving asymptotically optimal with respect to the welch bound . it 's worth mentioning that the codebooks constructed in this paper have new parameters .
