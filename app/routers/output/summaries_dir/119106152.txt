a quantum channel is conjugate degradable if the channel 's environment can be simulated up to complex conjugation using the channel 's output . for all such channels , the quantum capacity can be evaluated using a single - letter formula . in this article we introduce conjugate degradability and establish a number of its basic properties . we then use it to calculate the quantum capacity of n to n+1 and 1 to m universal quantum cloning machines as well as the quantum capacity of a channel that arises naturally when data is being transmitted to an accelerating receiver . all the channels considered turn out to have strictly positive quantum capacity , meaning they could be used as part of a communication system to send quantum states reliably .
