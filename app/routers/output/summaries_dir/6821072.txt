several proposals to produce { \it tripartite } $ w$-type entanglement are probabilistic even if no imperfections are considered in the processes . we provide a deterministic way to remotely create $ w$ states out of an epr source . the proposal is made viable through measurements ( which can be demolitive ) in an appropriate three - qubit basis . the protocol becomes probabilistic only when source flaws are considered . it turns out that , even in this situation , it is robust against imperfections in two senses : ( i ) it is possible , after postselection , to create a pure ensemble of $ w$ states out of an epr source containing a systematic error ; ( ii ) if no postselection is done , the resulting mixed state has a fidelity , with respect to a pure $ |w\rangle$ , which is higher than that of the imperfect source in comparison to an ideal epr source . this simultaneously amounts to entanglement concentration and { \it lifting } .
