the field space entanglement entropy of a quantum field theory is obtained by integrating out a subset of its fields . we study an interacting quantum field theory consisting of massless scalar fields on a closed compact manifold m. to this model we associate its lifshitz dual model . the ground states of both models are invariant under constant shifts . we interpret this invariance as gauge symmetry and subject the models to proper gauge fixing . by applying the heat kernel regularization one can show that the field space entanglement entropies of the massless scalar field model and of its lifshitz dual are agreeing .
