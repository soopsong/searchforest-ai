bennett and schumacher 's postselected quantum teleportation is a model of closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) that leads to results physically different from deutsch 's model . we show that even a single qubit passing through a postselected ctc ( p - ctc ) is sufficient to do any postselected quantum measurement , and we discuss an important difference between"deutschian"ctcs ( d - ctcs ) and p - ctcs in which the future existence of a p - ctc might affect the present outcome of an experiment . then , based on a suggestion of bennett and smith , we explicitly show how a party assisted by p - ctcs can distinguish a set of linearly independent quantum states , and we prove that it is not possible for such a party to distinguish a set of linearly dependent states . the power of p - ctcs is thus weaker than that of d - ctcs because the holevo bound still applies to circuits using them regardless of their ability to conspire in violating the uncertainty principle . we then discuss how different notions of a quantum mixture that are indistinguishable in linear quantum mechanics lead to dramatically differing conclusions in a nonlinear quantum mechanics involving p - ctcs . finally , we give explicit circuit constructions that can efficiently factor integers , efficiently solve any decision problem in the intersection of np and conp , and probabilistically solve any decision problem in np . these circuits accomplish these tasks with just one qubit traveling back in time , and they exploit the ability of postselected closed timelike curves to create grandfather paradoxes for invalid answers .
