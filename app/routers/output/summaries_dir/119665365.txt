we present a detailed security analysis of a d - dimensional quantum key distribution protocol based on two and three mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) both in an asymptotic and finite key length scenario . the finite secret key rates are calculated as a function of the length of the sifted key by ( i ) generalizing the uncertainly relation - based insight from bb84 to any d - level 2-mub qkd protocol and ( ii ) by adopting recent advances in the second - order asymptotics for finite block length quantum coding ( for both d - level 2- and 3-mub qkd protocols ) . since the finite and asymptotic secret key rates increase with d and the number of mubs ( together with the tolerable threshold ) such qkd schemes could in principle offer an important advantage over bb84 . we discuss the possibility of an experimental realization of the 3-mub qkd protocol with the orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom of photons .
