we investigate the behavior of two quantum emitters ( two - level atoms ) embedded in a linear waveguide , in a quasi - one - dimensional configuration . since the atoms can emit , absorb and reflect radiation , the pair can spontaneously relax towards an entangled bound state , under conditions in which a single atom would instead decay . we analyze the properties of these bound states , which occur for resonant values of the interatomic distance , and discuss their relevance with respect to entanglement generation . the stability of such states close to the resonance is studied , as well as the properties of non resonant bound states , whose energy is below the threshold for photon propagation .
