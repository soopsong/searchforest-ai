by modeling the coupling of multiple superconducting qubits to a single cavity in the circuit - quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) framework we find that it should be possible to observe superradiance and phase multistability using currently available technology . due to the exceptionally large couplings present in circuit - qed we predict that superradiant microwave pulses should be observable with only a very small number of qubits ( just three or four ) , in the presence of energy relaxation and non - uniform qubit - field coupling strengths . this paves the way for circuit - qed implementations of superradiant state readout and decoherence free subspace state encoding in subradiant states . the system considered here also exhibits phase multistability when driven with large field amplitudes , and this effect may have applications for collective qubit readout and for quantum feedback protocols .
