digital signals are complex - valued functions on $ \z_n$. signal sets with certain properties are required in various communication systems . traditional signal sets consider only the time distortion during transmission . recently , signal sets against both the time and phase distortion have been studied , and are called { \em time - phase } signal sets . several constructions of time - phase signal sets are available in the literature . there are a number of bounds on time signal sets ( also called codebooks ) . they are automatically bounds on time - phase signal sets , but are bad bounds . the first objective of this paper is to develop better bounds on time - phase signal sets from known bounds on time signal sets . the second objective of this paper is to construct two series of time - phase signal sets , one of which is optimal .
