we analyze optimal schemes and also propose some practical schemes for the nonlocal conversion from two shared bell pairs to four - qubit entangled states in optical quantum networks . in the analysis , we consider two - qubit operations as nonlocal operations and minimize the number of access to ancillary qubits as possible . first , we consider two - qubit unitary operations without using ancillary qubits and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for convertible states . second , we consider nonlocal optical systems composed of passive linear optics and postselection . for the passive linear optical systems , we derive achievable upper bounds of success probabilities of the conversion in the case without ancillary qubits . we also compare the optimal success probabilities with those of previously proposed schemes . finally , we discuss success probabilities of the conversion in the case with ancillary qubits .
