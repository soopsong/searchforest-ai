we determine the quantum cram\'er - rao bound for the precision with which the oscillator frequency and damping constant of a damped quantum harmonic oscillator in an arbitrary gaussian state can be estimated . this goes beyond standard quantum parameter estimation of a single mode gaussian state for which typically a mode of fixed frequency is assumed . we present a scheme through which the frequency estimation can nevertheless be based on the known results for single - mode quantum parameter estimation with gaussian states . based on these results , we investigate the optimal measurement time . for measuring the oscillator frequency , our results unify previously known partial results and constitute an explicit solution for a general single - mode gaussian state . furthermore , we show that with existing carbon nanotube resonators ( see j. chaste et al.~nature nanotechnology 7 , 301 ( 2012 ) ) it should be possible to achieve a mass sensitivity of the order of an electron mass $ \text{hz}^{-1/2}$.
