this paper is concerned with translation invariant networks of linear quantum stochastic systems with nearest neighbour interaction mediated by boson fields . the systems are associated with sites of a one - dimensional chain or a multidimensional lattice and are governed by coupled linear quantum stochastic differential equations ( qsdes ) . such interconnections of open quantum systems are relevant , for example , to the phonon theory of crystalline solids , atom trapping in optical lattices and quantum metamaterials . in order to represent a large - scale open quantum harmonic oscillator , the coefficients of the coupled qsdes must satisfy certain physical realizability conditions . these are established in the form of matrix algebraic equations for the parameters of an individual building block of the network and its interaction with the neighbours and external fields . we also discuss the computation of mean square performance functionals with block toeplitz weighting matrices for such systems in the thermodynamic limit per site for unboundedly increasing fragments of the lattice .
