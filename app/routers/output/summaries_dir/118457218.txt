sped - up protocols ( shortcuts to adiabaticity ) that drive a system quickly to the same populations than a slow adiabatic process may involve hamiltonian terms difficult to realize in practice . we use the dynamical symmetry of the hamiltonian to find , by means of lie transforms , alternative hamiltonians that achieve the same goals without the problematic terms . we apply this technique to three - level systems ( two interacting bosons in a double well , and beam splitters with two and three output channels ) driven by hamiltonians that belong to the four - dimensional algebra u3s3 .
