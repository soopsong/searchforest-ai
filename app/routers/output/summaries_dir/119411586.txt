einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) steering exhibits an inherent asymmetric feature that differs from both entanglement and bell nonlocality , which leads to one - way epr steering . although this one - way epr steering phenomenon has been experimentally observed , the schemes to manipulate the direction of epr steering have not been investigated thoroughly . in this paper , we propose and experimentally demonstrate three schemes to manipulate the direction of epr steering , either by varying the noise on one party of a two - mode squeezed state ( tmss ) or transmitting the tmss in a noisy channel . the dependence of the direction of epr steering on the noise and transmission efficiency in the quantum channel is analyzed . the experimental results show that the direction of epr steering of the tmss can be changed in the presented schemes . our work is helpful in understanding the fundamental asymmetry of quantum nonlocality and has potential applications in future asymmetric quantum information processing .
