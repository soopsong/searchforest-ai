we report on the implementation and detailed modelling of a josephson parametric amplifier ( jpa ) made from an array of eighty superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) , forming a non - linear quarter - wave resonator . this device was fabricated using a very simple single step fabrication process . it shows a large bandwidth ( 45 mhz ) , an operating frequency tunable between 5.9 ghz and 6.8 ghz and a large input saturation power ( -117 dbm ) when biased to obtain 20 db of gain . despite the length of the squid array being comparable to the wavelength , we present a model based on an effective non - linear lc series resonator that quantitatively describes these figures of merit without fitting parameters . our work illustrates the advantage of using array - based jpa since a single - squid device showing the same bandwidth and resonant frequency would display a saturation power 15 db lower .
