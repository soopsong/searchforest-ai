we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for separability of mixed states of n - particle systems . the conditions are formulated in terms of maps which are positive on product states of $ n-1 $ particles . the method of providing of the maps on the basis of unextendable product bases is provided . the three qubit state problem is reformulated in the form suggesting possibility of explicite characterisation of all maps needed for separability condition .
