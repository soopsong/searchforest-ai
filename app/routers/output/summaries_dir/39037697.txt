we define thermodynamic configurations and identify two primitives of discrete quantum processes between configurations for which heat and work can be defined in a natural way . this allows us to uncover a general second law for any discrete trajectory that consists of a sequence of these primitives , linking both equilibrium and non - equilibrium configurations . moreover , in the limit of a discrete trajectory that passes through an infinite number of configurations , i.e. in the reversible limit , we recover the saturation of the second law . finally , we show that for a discrete carnot cycle operating between four configurations one recovers carnot 's thermal efficiency .
