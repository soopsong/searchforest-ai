we propose an experiment to test the effects of gravity and acceleration on quantum entanglement in space - based setups . we show that the entanglement between excitations of two bose - einstein condensates is degraded after one of them undergoes a change in the gravitational field strength . this prediction can be tested if the condensates are initially entangled in two separate satellites while being in the same orbit and then one of them moves to a different orbit . we show that the effect is observable in a typical orbital manoeuvre of nanosatellites like canx4 and canx5 .
