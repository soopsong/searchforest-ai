we address quantum $ m$-ary phase - shift keyed ( psk ) communication channels in the presence of phase diffusion , and analyze the use of probabilistic noiseless linear amplifiers ( nla ) to enhance performance of coherent signals . we consider both static and dynamical phase diffusion and assess the performances of the channel for ideal and realistic phase receivers . our results show that nla employed at the stage of signal preparations is a useful resource , especially in the regime of weak signals . we also discuss the interplay between the use of nla , and the memory effects occurring with dynamical noise , in determining the capacity of the channel .
