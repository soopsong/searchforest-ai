we theoretically investigate the dynamics of a gas of strongly interacting rydberg atoms subject to a time - domain ramsey interferometry protocol . the many - body dynamics is governed by an ising - type hamiltonian with long range interactions of tunable strength . we analyze and model the contrast degradation and phase accumulation of the ramsey signal and identify scaling laws for varying interrogation times , ensemble densities , and ensemble dimensionalities .
