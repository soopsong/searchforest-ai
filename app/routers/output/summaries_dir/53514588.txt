we present a circuit construction for a new fixed - frequency superconducting qubit and show how it can be scaled up to a grid with strictly local interactions . the circuit qed realization we propose implements $ \sigma_z$-type coupling between a superconducting qubit and any number of $ lc$ resonators . the resulting \textit{longitudinal coupling } is inherently different from the usual $ \sigma_x$-type \textit{transverse coupling } , which is the one that has been most commonly used for superconducting qubits . in a grid of fixed - frequency qubits and resonators with a particular pattern of always - on interactions , coupling is strictly confined to nearest and next - nearest neighbor resonators ; there is never any direct qubit - qubit coupling . we note that just four distinct resonator frequencies , and only a single unique qubit frequency , suffice for the scalability of this scheme . a controlled phase gate between two neighboring qubits can be realized with microwave drives on the qubits , without affecting the other qubits . this fact is a supreme advantage for the scalability of this scheme .
