the classical and quantum correlations sharing between modes of the dirac fields in the noninertial frame are investigated . it is shown that : ( i ) the classical correlation for the dirac fields decreases as the acceleration increases , which is different from the result of the scalar field that the classical correlation is independent of the acceleration ; ( ii ) there is no simple dominating relation between the quantum correlation and entanglement for the dirac fields , which is unlike the scalar case where the quantum correlation is always over and above the entanglement ; ( iii ) as the acceleration increases , the correlations between modes $ i$ and $ ii$ and between modes $ a$ and $ ii$ increase , but the correlations between modes $ a$ and $ i$ decrease .
