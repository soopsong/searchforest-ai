one of the most widely used techniques for measuring the orbital angular momentum components of a light beam is to flatten the spiral phase front of a mode , in order to couple it to a single - mode optical fiber . this method , however , suffers from an efficiency that depends on the orbital angular momentum of the initial mode and on the presence of higher order radial modes . the reason is that once the phase has been flattened , the field retains its ringed intensity pattern and is therefore a nontrivial superposition of purely radial modes , of which only the fundamental one couples to a single mode optical fiber . in this paper , we study the efficiency of this technique both theoretically and experimentally . we find that even for low values of the oam , a large amount of light can fall outside the fundamental mode of the fiber , and we quantify the losses as functions of the waist of the coupling beam of the orbital angular momentum and radial indices . our results can be used as a tool to remove the efficiency bias where fair - sampling loopholes are not a concern . however , we hope that our study will encourage the development of better detection methods of the orbital angular momentum content of a beam of light .
