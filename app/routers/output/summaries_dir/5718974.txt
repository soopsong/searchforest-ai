memristors have been compared to neurons ( usually specifically the synapses ) since 1976 but no experimental evidence has been offered for support for this position . here we highlight that memristors naturally form fast - response , highly reproducible and repeatable current spikes which can be used in voltage - driven neuromorphic architecture . ease of fitting current spikes with memristor theories both suggests that the spikes are part of the memristive effect and provides modeling capability for the design of neuromorphic circuits .
