absorption refrigerators transfer thermal energy from a cold bath to a hot bath without input power by utilizing heat from an additional"work"reservoir . particularly interesting is a three - level design for a quantum absorption refrigerator , which can be optimized to reach the maximal ( carnot ) cooling efficiency . previous studies of three - level chillers focused on the behavior of the averaged cooling current . here , we go beyond that and study the full counting statistics of heat exchange in a three - level chiller model . we explain how to obtain the complete cumulant generating function of the refrigerator in steady state , then derive a partial cumulant generating function , which yields closed - form expressions for both the averaged cooling current and its noise . our analytical results and simulations are beneficial for the design of nanoscale engines and cooling systems far from equilibrium , with their performance optimized according to different criteria , efficiency , power , fluctuations and dissipation .
