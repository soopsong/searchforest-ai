the paper is concerned with a problem of coherent ( measurement - free ) filtering for physically realizable ( pr ) linear quantum plants . the state variables of such systems satisfy canonical commutation relations and are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations , dynamically equivalent to those of an open quantum harmonic oscillator . the problem is to design another pr quantum system , connected unilaterally to the output of the plant and playing the role of a quantum filter , so as to minimize a mean square discrepancy between the dynamic variables of the plant and the output of the filter . this coherent quantum filtering ( cqf ) formulation is a simplified feedback - free version of the coherent quantum lqg control problem which remains open despite recent studies . the cqf problem is transformed into a constrained covariance control problem which is treated by using the frechet differentiation of an appropriate lagrange function with respect to the matrices of the filter .
