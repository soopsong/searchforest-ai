boson sampling , thought to be intractable classically , can be solved by a quantum machine composed of merely generation , linear evolution and detection of single photons . such an analog quantum computer for this specific problem provides a shortcut to boost the absolute computing power of quantum computers to beat classical ones . however , the capacity bound of classical computers for simulating boson sampling has not yet been identified . here we simulate boson sampling on the tianhe-2 supercomputer which occupied the first place in the world ranking six times from 2013 to 2016 . we computed the permanent of the largest matrix using up to 312,000 cpu cores of tianhe-2 , and inferred from the current most efficient permanent - computing algorithms that an upper bound on the performance of tianhe-2 is one 50-photon sample per ~100 min . in addition , we found a precision issue with one of two permanent - computing algorithms .
