in the last years , several works have demonstrated the advantage of photon subtracted gaussian states for various quantum optics and information protocols . in all these works , it was not clear about the origin of such advantages . for the first time , we have extensively studied multi photon annihilated squeezed vacuum state for single phase and correlated phase estimations . we have obtained compact expressions which have not yet reported elsewhere , showing that multi - photon subtracted states can be obtained by applying squeezing operators to a certain class of superposition states . with this tool , we have shown that for single phase estimation , albeit the use of multi - photon annihilated squeezed vacuum states at low mean photons per mode provide advantage compared to classical strategy with equivalent energy , when the total input energies is held fixed , the advantage due to photon subtraction is completely lost . however , for the correlated case in analogous scenario , some advantage appears to come from both the energy rise and improvement in photon statistics . in particular photon subtracted states conserve the advantage of about 30 % even in case of realistic value of the optical losses .
