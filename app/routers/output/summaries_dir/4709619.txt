simulating the time - evolution of quantum mechanical systems is bqp - hard and expected to be one of the foremost applications of quantum computers . we consider the approximation of hamiltonian dynamics using subsampling methods from randomized numerical linear algebra . we propose conditions for the efficient approximation of state vectors evolving under a given hamiltonian . as an immediate application , we show that sample based quantum simulation , a type of evolution where the hamiltonian is a density matrix , can be efficiently classically simulated under specific structural conditions . our main technical contribution is a randomized algorithm for approximating hermitian matrix exponentials . the proof leverages the nystr\"om method to obtain low - rank approximations of the hamiltonian . we envisage that techniques from randomized linear algebra will bring further insights into the power of quantum computation .
