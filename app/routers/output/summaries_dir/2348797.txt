miniaturized ion trap arrays with many trap segments present a promising architecture for scalable quantum information processing . the miniaturization of segmented linear paul traps allows partitioning the microtrap in different storage and processing zones . the individual position control of many ions - each of them carrying qubit information in its long - lived electronic levels - by the external trap control voltages is important for the implementation of next generation large - scale quantum algorithms . we present a novel scalable microchip multi - segmented ion trap with two different adjacent zones , one for the storage and another dedicated for the processing of quantum information using single ions and linear ion crystals : a pair of radio - frequency driven electrodes and 62 independently controlled dc electrodes allows shuttling of single ions or linear ion crystals with numerically designed axial potentials at axial and radial trap frequencies of a few mhz . we characterize and optimize the microtrap using sideband spectroscopy on the narrow s1/2<->d5/2 qubit transition of the 40ca+ ion , demonstrate coherent single qubit rabi rotations and optical cooling methods . we determine the heating rate using sideband cooling measurements to the vibrational ground state which is necessary for subsequent two - qubit quantum logic operations . the applicability for scalable quantum information processing is proven .
