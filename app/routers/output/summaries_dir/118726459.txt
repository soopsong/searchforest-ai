inspired by recent work [ a. w. carr and m. saffman , phys . rev . lett . 111 , 033607 ( 2013 ) ] , we propose a simplified scheme to prepare the two - atom maximally entangled states via dissipative rydberg pumping . compared with the former scheme , the simplified one involves less classical laser fields and rydberg interactions , and the asymmetric rydberg interactions are avoided . master equation simulations demonstrate that the fidelity and the clauser - horne - shimony - holt correlation of the maximally entangled state could reach up to 0.999 and 2.821 , respectively , under certain conditions . furthermore , we extend the physical thoughts to prepare the three - dimensional entangled state , the numerical simulations show that , in theory , both the fidelity and the negativity of the desired entanglement could be very close to unity under certain conditions .
