we generalize the concept of the wehrl entropy of quantum states which gives a basis - independent measure of their localization in phase space . we discuss the minimal values and the typical values of these r{enyi - wehrl entropies for pure states for spin systems . according to lieb 's conjecture the minimal values are provided by the spin coherent states . though lieb 's conjecture remains unproven , we give new proofs of partial results that may be generalized for other systems . we also investigate random pure states and calculate the mean renyi - wehrl entropies averaged over the natural measure in the space of pure quantum states .
