rydberg blockaded gate is a fundamental ingredient for scalable quantum computation with neutral rydberg atoms . however the fidelity of such a gate is intrinsically limited by a blockade error coming from a rydberg level shift that forbids its extensive use . based on a dark - state adiabatic passage , we develop a novel protocol for realizing a two - atom blockade - error - free quantum gate in a hybrid system with simultaneous van der waals ( vdwsi ) and resonant dipole - dipole interactions ( ddi ) . the basic idea relies on converting the roles of two interactions , which is , the ddi serves as one time - dependent tunable pulse and the vdwsi acts as a negligible middle level shift as long as the adiabatic condition is preserved . we adopt an optimized super - gaussian optical pulse with $ k\pi$ ( $ k\gg 1 $ ) area accompanied by a smooth tuning for the ddi , composing a circular stimulated raman adiabatic passage , which can robustly ensure a faster operation time $ \sim 80ns$ as well as a highly - efficient gate fidelity $ \sim0.9996$. this theoretical protocol offers a flexible treatment for hybrid interactions in complex rydberg systems , enabling on - demand design of new types of effective rydberg quantum gate devices .
