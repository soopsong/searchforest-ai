ibm has made several quantum computers available to researchers around the world via cloud services . two architectures with five qubits , one with 16 , and one with 20 qubits are available to run experiments . the ibm architectures implement gates from the clifford+t gate library . however , each architecture only implements a subset of the possible cnot gates . in this paper , we show how clifford+t circuits can efficiently be mapped into the two ibm quantum computers with 5 qubits . we further present an algorithm and a set of circuit identities that may be used to optimize the clifford+t circuits in terms of gate count and number of levels . it is further shown that the optimized circuits can considerably reduce the gate count and number of levels and thus produce results with better fidelity .
