we propose a quantum optical version of schr\"{o}dinger 's famous gedanken experiment in which the state of a microscopic system ( a cavity field ) becomes entangled with and disentangled from the state of a massive object ( a movable mirror ) . despite the fact that a mixture of schr\"{o}dinger cat states is produced during the evolution ( due to the fact that the macroscopic mirror starts off in a thermal state ) , this setup allows us to systematically probe the rules by which a superposition of spatially separated states of a macroscopic object decoheres . the parameter regime required to test environment - induced decoherence models is found to be close to those currently realizable , while that required to detect gravitationally induced collapse is well beyond current technology .
