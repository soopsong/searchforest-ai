in this paper , we prove a quantum union bound that is relevant when performing a sequence of binary - outcome quantum measurements on a quantum state . the quantum union bound proved here involves a tunable parameter that can be optimized , and this tunable parameter plays a similar role to a parameter involved in the hayashi - nagaoka inequality [ ieee trans . inf . theory , 49(7):1753 ( 2003 ) ] , used often in quantum information theory when analyzing the error probability of a square - root measurement . an advantage of the proof delivered here is that it is elementary , relying only on basic properties of projectors , the pythagorean theorem , and the cauchy -- schwarz inequality . as a non - trivial application of our quantum union bound , we prove that a sequential decoding strategy for classical communication over a quantum channel achieves a lower bound on the channel 's second - order coding rate . this demonstrates the advantage of our quantum union bound in the non - asymptotic regime , in which a communication channel is called a finite number of times . we expect that the bound will find a range of applications in quantum communication theory , quantum algorithms , and quantum complexity theory .
