we define coined quantum walks on the infinite rooted binary tree given by unitary operators $ u(c)$ on an associated infinite dimensional hilbert space , depending on a unitary coin matrix $ c\in u(3)$ , and study their spectral properties . for circulant unitary coin matrices $ c$ , we derive an equation for the carath\'eodory function associated to the spectral measure of a cyclic vector for $ u(c)$. this allows us to show that for all circulant unitary coin matrices , the spectrum of the quantum walk has no singular continuous component . furthermore , for coin matrices $ c$ which are orthogonal circulant matrices , we show that the spectrum of the quantum walk is absolutely continuous , except for four coin matrices for which the spectrum of $ u(c)$ is pure point .
