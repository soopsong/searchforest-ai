we introduce the model of generalized open quantum walks on networks using the transition operation matrices formalism . we focus our analysis on the mean first passage time and the average return time in apollonian networks . these results differ significantly from a classical walk on these networks . we show a comparison of the classical and quantum behaviour of walks on these networks .
