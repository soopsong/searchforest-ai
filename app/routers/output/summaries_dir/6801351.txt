we consider an atom inside a ring cavity , where a plane - wave cavity field together with an external coherent laser beam induces a two - photon raman transition between two hyperfine ground states of the atom . this cavity - assisted raman transition induces effective coupling between atom 's internal degrees of freedom and its center - of - mass motion . in ~ the meantime , atomic dynamics exerts a back - action to cavity photons . we investigate the properties of this system by adopting a mean - field and a full quantum approach , and show that the interplay between the atomic dynamics and the cavity field gives rise to intriguing nonlinear phenomena .
