how can a schwarzschild - sized matter system avoid a fate of gravitational collapse ? to address this question , we critically reexamine the arguments that led to the"buchdahl bound " , which implies that the minimal size of a stable , compact object must be larger than nine eighths of its own schwarzschild radius . following mazur and mottola , and in line with other counterexamples to the singularity theorems , we identify large negative radial pressure extending to the gravitational radius as the essential ingredient for evading the buchdahl bound . our results are novel although consistent with many other investigations of models of non - singular black holes . it is shown in particular that a large negative pressure in the framework of classical gr translates into a large positive pressure once quantum physics is incorporated . in this way , a schwarzschild - sized bound state of closed , interacting fundamental strings in its high - temperature hagedorn phase can appear to have negative pressure and thus the ability to resist gravitational collapse .
