we consider the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) on a finite lattice with periodic boundary conditions , conditioned to carry an atypically low current . for an infinite discrete set of currents , parametrized by the driving strength $ s_k$ , $ k \geq 1 $ , we prove duality relations which arise from the quantum algebra $ u_q[\mathfrak{gl}(2)]$ symmetry of the generator of the process with reflecting boundary conditions . using these duality relations we prove on microscopic level a travelling - wave property of the conditioned process for a family of shock - antishock measures for $ n > k$ particles : if the initial measure is a member of this family with $ k$ microscopic shocks at positions $ ( x_1,\dots , x_k)$ , then the measure at any time $ t>0 $ of the process with driving strength $ s_k$ is a convex combination of such measures with shocks at positions $ ( y_1,\dots , y_k)$. which can be expressed in terms of $ k$-particle transition probabilities of the conditioned asep with driving strength $ s_n$.
