the electronic properties of superconducting sn films ( $ t_c \approx$ 3.8 k ) change significantly when reducing the film thickness down to a few nm , in particular close to the percolation threshold . the low - energy electrodynamics of such sn samples can be probed via microwave spectroscopy , e.g. with superconducting stripline resonators . here we study sn thin films , deposited via thermal evaporation -ranging in thickness between 38 nm and 842 nm- which encompasses the percolation transition . we use superconducting pb stripline resonators to probe the microwave response of these sn films in a frequency range between 4 ghz and 20 ghz at temperatures from 7.2 k down to 1.5 k. the measured quality factor of the resonators decreases with rising temperature due to enhanced losses . as a function of the sample thickness we observe three regimes with significantly different properties : samples below percolation , i.e. ensembles of disconnected superconducting islands , exhibit dielectric properties with negligible losses , demonstrating that macroscopic current paths are required for appreciable dynamical conductivity of sn at ghz frequencies . thick sn films , as the other limit , lead to low - loss resonances both above and below $ t_c$ of sn , as expected for bulk conductors . but in an intermediate thickness regime , just above percolation and with labyrinth - like morphology of the sn , we observe a quite different behavior : the superconducting state has a microwave response similar to the thicker , completely covering films with low microwave losses ; but the metallic state of these sn films is so lossy that resonator operation is suppressed completely .
