although it is believed unlikely that $ \np$-hard problems admit efficient quantum algorithms , it has been shown that a quantum verifier can solve $ \np$-complete problems given a"short"quantum proof ; more precisely , $ \np\subseteq \qma_{\log}(2)$ where $ \qma_{\log}(2)$ denotes the class of quantum merlin - arthur games in which there are two unentangled provers who send two logarithmic size quantum witnesses to the verifier . the inclusion $ \np\subseteq \qma_{\log}(2)$ has been proved by blier and tapp by stating a quantum merlin - arthur protocol for 3-coloring with perfect completeness and gap $ \frac{1}{24n^6}$. moreover , aaronson { \it et al . } have shown the above inclusion with a constant gap by considering $ \widetilde{o}(\sqrt{n})$ witnesses of logarithmic size . however , we still do not know if $ \qma_{\log}(2)$ with a constant gap contains $ \np$. in this paper , we show that 3-sat admits a $ \qma_{\log}(2)$ protocol with the gap $ \frac{1}{n^{3+\epsilon}}$ for every constant $ \epsilon>0$.
