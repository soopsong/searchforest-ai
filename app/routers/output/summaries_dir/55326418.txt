we present methods for the direct characterization of quantum dynamics ( dcqd ) in which both the principal and ancilla systems undergo noisy processes . using a concatenated error detection code , we discriminate between located and unlocated errors on the principal system in what amounts to filtering of ancilla noise . the example of composite noise involving amplitude damping and depolarizing channels is used to demonstrate the method , while we find the rate of noise filtering is more generally dependent on code distance . our results indicate the accuracy of quantum process characterization can be greatly improved while remaining within reach of current experimental capabilities .
