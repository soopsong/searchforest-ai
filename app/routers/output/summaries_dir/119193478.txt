we study quantum process tomography given the prior information that the map is a unitary or close to a unitary process . we show that a unitary map on a $ d$-level system is completely characterized by a minimal set of $ d^2{+}d$ elements associated with a collection of povms , in contrast to the $ d^4{-}d^2 $ elements required for a general completely positive trace - preserving map . to achieve this lower bound , one must probe the map with a particular set of $ d$ pure states . we further compare the performance of different compressed sensing algorithms used to reconstruct a near - unitary process from such data . we find that when we have accurate prior information , an appropriate compressed sensing method reduces the required data needed for high - fidelity estimation , and different estimators applied to the same data are sensitive to different types of noise . compressed sensing techniques can therefore be used both as indicators of error models and to validate the use of the prior assumptions .
