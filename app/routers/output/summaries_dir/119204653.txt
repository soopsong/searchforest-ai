we analyze two families of three - state quantum walks which show the localization effect . we focus on the role of the initial coin state and its coherence in controlling the properties of the quantum walk . in particular , we show that the description of the walk simplifies considerably when the initial coin state is decomposed in the basis formed by the eigenvectors of the coin operator . this allows us to express the limit distributions in a much more convenient form . consequently , striking features which are hidden in the standard basis description are easily identified . moreover , the dependence of moments of the position distribution on the initial coin state can be analyzed in full detail . in particular , we find that in the eigenvector basis the even moments and the localization probability at the origin depend only on incoherent combination of probabilities . in contrast , odd moments and localization outside the origin are affected by the coherence of the initial coin state .
