we establish two complementarity relations for the relative entropy of coherence in quantum information processing , i.e. , quantum dense coding and teleportation . we first give an uncertaintylike expression relating local quantum coherence to the capacity of optimal dense coding for bipartite system . the relation can also be applied to the case of dense coding by using unital memoryless noisy quantum channels . further , the relation between local quantum coherence and teleportation fidelity for two - qubit system is given .
