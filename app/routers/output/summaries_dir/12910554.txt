we demonstrate the ability of a phase - sensitive amplifier ( psa ) to pre - amplify a selected quadrature of one mode of a two - mode squeezed state in order to improve the measurement of two - mode quantum correlations that exist before degradation due to optical and detection losses . we use four - wave mixing ( 4wm ) in $ ^{85}$rb vapor to generate bright beams in a two - mode squeezed state . one of these two modes then passes through a second 4wm interaction in a psa configuration to noiselessly pre - amplify the desired quadrature of the mode before loss is intentionally introduced . we demonstrate an enhancement in the measured degree of intensity correlation and intensity - difference squeezing between the two modes .
