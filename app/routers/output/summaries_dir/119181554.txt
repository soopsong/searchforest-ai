we study the ( pseudo- ) anyon hubbard model on a one - dimensional lattice without the presence of a three - body hardcore constraint . in particular , for the pseudo - fermion limit of a large statistical angle $ \theta\approx\pi$ , we observe a wealth of exotic properties including { a first order transition } between different superfluid phases and a { two - component } partially paired phase for large fillings without need of an additional three - body hardcore constraint.in this limit , we analyze the effect of an induced hardcore constraint , which leads to the stabilization of superfluid { ground states } for vanishing or even small attractive on - site interactions . for finite statistical angles , we study the unconventional broken - symmetry superfluid peaked at a finite momentum , resulting in an interesting beat phenomenon of single particle correlation functions.we show how some features of various ground state phases , including an analog of the partially paired phase in the pseudo - fermion limit , may be reproduced in a naive mean field frame .
