in 1994 , reck et al . showed how to realize any unitary transformation on a single photon using a product of beamsplitters and phaseshifters . here we show that any single beamsplitter that nontrivially mixes two modes , also densely generates the set of unitary transformations ( or orthogonal transformations , in the real case ) on the single - photon subspace with m>=3 modes . ( we prove the same result for any two - mode real optical gate , and for any two - mode optical gate combined with a generic phaseshifter . ) experimentally , this means that one does not need tunable beamsplitters or phaseshifters for universality : any nontrivial beamsplitter is universal for linear optics . theoretically , it means that one can not produce"intermediate"models of linear optical computation ( analogous to the clifford group for qubits ) by restricting the allowed beamsplitters and phaseshifters : there is a dichotomy ; one either gets a trivial set or else a universal set . no similar classification theorem for gates acting on qubits is currently known . we leave open the problem of classifying optical gates that act on three or more modes .
