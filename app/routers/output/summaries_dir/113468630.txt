we experimentally realize a measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution ( mdi - qkd ) system based on cost - effective and commercially available hardware such as distributed feedback ( dfb ) lasers and field - programmable gate arrays ( fpga ) that enable time - bin qubit preparation and time - tagging , and active feedback systems that allow for compensation of time - varying properties of photons after transmission through deployed fibre . we examine the performance of our system , and conclude that its design does not compromise performance . our demonstration paves the way for mdi - qkd - based quantum networks in star - type topology that extend over more than 100 km distance .
