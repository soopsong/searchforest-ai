we derive formal selection rules for stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) in structured waveguides . using a group - theoretical approach , we show how the waveguide symmetry determines which optical and acoustic modes interact for both forward and backward sbs . we present a general framework for determining this interaction and give important examples for sbs in waveguides with rectangular , triangular and hexagonal symmetry . the important role played by degeneracy of the optical modes is illustrated . these selection rules are important for sbs - based device design and for a full understanding the physics of sbs in structured waveguides .
