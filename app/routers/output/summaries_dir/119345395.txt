an optically levitated nonspherical nanoparticle can exhibit both librational and translational vibrations due to orientational and translational confinements of the optical tweezer , respectively . usually , the frequency of its librational mode in a linearly - polarized optical tweezer is much larger than the frequency of its translational mode . because of the frequency mismatch , the intrinsic coupling between librational and translational modes is very weak in vacuum . here we propose a scheme to couple its librational and center - of - mass modes with an optical cavity mode . by adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode , the beam splitter hamiltonian between librational and center - of - mass modes can be realized . we find that high - fidelity quantum state transfer between the librational and translational modes can be achieved with practical parameters . our work may find applications in sympathetic cooling of multiple modes and quantum information processing .
