the key cryptographic protocols used to secure the internet and financial transactions of today are all susceptible to attack by the development of a sufficiently large quantum computer . one particular area at risk is cryptocurrencies , a market currently worth over 100 billion usd . we investigate the risk posed to bitcoin , and other cryptocurrencies , by attacks using quantum computers . we find that the proof - of - work used by bitcoin is relatively resistant to substantial speedup by quantum computers in the next 10 years , mainly because specialized asic miners are extremely fast compared to the estimated clock speed of near - term quantum computers . on the other hand , the elliptic curve signature scheme used by bitcoin is much more at risk , and could be completely broken by a quantum computer as early as 2027 , by the most optimistic estimates . we analyze an alternative proof - of - work called momentum , based on finding collisions in a hash function , that is even more resistant to speedup by a quantum computer . we also review the available post - quantum signature schemes to see which one would best meet the security and efficiency requirements of blockchain applications .
