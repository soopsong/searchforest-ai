taming decoherence is essential in realizing quantum computation and quantum communication . here we experimentally demonstrate that decoherence due to amplitude damping can be suppressed by exploiting quantum measurement reversal in which a weak measurement and the reversing measurement are introduced before and after the decoherence channel , respectively . we have also investigated the trade - off relation between the degree of decoherence suppression and the channel transmittance .
