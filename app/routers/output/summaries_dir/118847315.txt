in this essay , we consider highly entangled states in theories with a gravity dual , where the entangled degrees of freedom are causally disconnected from each other . using the basic rules of holography , we argue that there is a non - traversable wormhole in the gravity dual whose geometry encodes the pattern of the entanglement .
