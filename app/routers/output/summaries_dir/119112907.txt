we use a quantum non - demolition measurement to generate a spin squeezed state and to create entanglement in a cloud of 10 ^ 5 cold cesium atoms , and for the first time operate an atomic clock improved by spin squeezing beyond the projection noise limit in a proof - of - principle experiment . for a clock - interrogation time of 10 \mu\s the experiments show an improvement of 1.1 db in the signal - to - noise ratio , compared to the atomic projection noise limit .
