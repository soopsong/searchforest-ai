we extend the idea of weak measurements to the general case , provide a complete treatment and obtain results for both the regime when the pre - selected and post - selected states ( pps ) are almost orthogonal and the regime when they are exactly orthogonal . we surprisingly find that for a fixed interaction strength , there may exist a maximum signal amplification and a corresponding optimum overlap of pps to achieve it . for weak measurements in the orthogonal regime , we find interesting quantities that play the same role that weak values play in the non - orthogonal regime .
