an analysis of the motion of a relativistic electron under a linear constraint in four dimensions is presented . interesting results are given that show that the state of the electron is well defined under the formalism of time optimal quantum state control . we establish compact mechanisms for achieving time dependent unitary evolution , and present new calculation methods for time - ordered exponential operators . a powerful modification of the brachistochrone technique is presented that allows solution of a class of problems via matrix decomposition of the hamiltonian . these techniques allow us to arrive at a series of solutions for quantum systems that have readily accessible physical realisations . we contrast the output of the theory when constrained to a relativistic space - time to that of other physical systems of lower dimensionality . some comment is given regarding hypercomplex numbers and their application in quantum mechanics .
