in traditional thermodynamics the carnot cycle yields the ideal performance bound of heat engines and refrigerators . we propose and analyze a minimal model of a heat machine that can play a similar role in quantum regimes . the minimal model consists of a single two - level system with periodically modulated energy splitting that is permanently , weakly , coupled to two spectrally - separated heat baths at different temperatures . the equation of motion allows to compute the stationary power and heat currents in the machine consistently with the second - law of thermodynamics . this dual - purpose machine can act as either an engine or a refrigerator ( heat pump ) depending on the modulation rate . in both modes of operation the maximal carnot efficiency is reached at zero power . we study the conditions for finite - time optimal performance for several variants of the model . possible realizations of the model are discussed .
