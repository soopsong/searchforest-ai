in this paper , we consider a linear quantum network composed of two distantly separated cavities that are connected via a one - way optical field . when one of the cavity is damped and the other is undamped , the overall cavity state obtains a large amount of entanglement in its quadratures . this entanglement however immediately decays and vanishes in a finite time . that is , entanglement sudden - death occurs . we show that the direct measurement feedback method proposed by wiseman can avoid this entanglement sudden - death , and further , enhance the entanglement . it is also shown that the entangled state under feedback control is robust against signal loss in a realistic detector , indicating the reliability of the proposed direct feedback method in practical situations .
