we design and explore a shortcut to adiabaticity ( sta ) for changing the interaction strength between two ultracold , harmonically trapped bosons . starting from initially uncorrelated , non - interacting particles , we assume a time - dependent tuning of the inter - particle interaction through a feshbach resonance , such that the two particles are strongly interacting at the end of the driving . the efficiency of the sta is then quantified by examining the thermodynamic properties of the system , such as the irreversible work , which is related to the out - of - equilibrium excitations in the system . we also quantify the entanglement of the two - particle state through the von neumann entropy and show that the entanglement produced in the sta process matches that of the desired target state . given the fundamental nature of the two - atom problem in ultracold atomic physics , the presented shortcut can be expected to have significant impact on many processes that rely on inter - particle interactions .
