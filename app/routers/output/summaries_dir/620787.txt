we propose a tunable on - chip micromaser using a superconducting quantum circuit ( sqc ) . by taking advantage of externally controllable state transitions , a state population inversion can be achieved and preserved for the two working levels of the sqc and , when needed , the sqc can generate a single photon . we can regularly repeat these processes in each cycle when the previously generated photon in the cavity is decaying , so that a periodic sequence of single photons can be produced persistently . this provides a controllable way for implementing a persistent single - photon source on a microelectronic chip .
