we report on energy - time and time - bin entangled photon - pair sources based on a periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) waveguide . degenerate twin photons at 1314 nm wavelength are created by spontaneous parametric down - conversion and coupled into standard telecom fibers . our ppln waveguide features a very high conversion efficiency of about 10^(-6 ) , roughly 4 orders of magnitude more than that obtained employing bulk crystals . even if using low power laser diodes , this engenders a significant probability for creating two pairs at a time - an important advantage for some quantum communication protocols . we point out a simple means to characterize the pair creation probability in case of a pulsed pump . to investigate the quality of the entangled states , we perform photon - pair interference experiments , leading to visibilities of 97 % for the case of energy - time entanglement and of 84 % for the case of time - bin entanglement . although the last figure must still be improved , these tests demonstrate the high potential of ppln waveguide based sources to become a key element for future quantum communication schemes
