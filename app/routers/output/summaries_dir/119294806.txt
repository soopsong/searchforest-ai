we revisit , in the framework of mach - zehnder interferometry , the connection between the complementarity and uncertainty principles of quantum mechanics . specifically , we show that , for a pair of suitably chosen observables , the trade - off relation between the complementary path information and fringe visibility is equivalent to the uncertainty relation given by schr\"odinger and robertson , and to the one provided by landau and pollak as well . we also employ entropic uncertainty relations ( based on r\'enyi entropic measures ) and study their meaning for different values of the entropic parameter . we show that these different values define regimes which yield qualitatively different information concerning the system , in agreement with findings of [ a. luis , phys . rev . a 84 , 034101 ( 2011 ) ] . we find that there exists a regime for which the entropic uncertinty relations can be used as criteria to pinpoint non trivial states of minimum uncertainty .
