we demonstrate an experimental method for measuring energy - time entanglement over almost 80 nm spectral bandwidth in a single shot with a quantum bit error rate below 0.5 % . our scheme is extremely cost - effective and efficient in terms of resources as it employs only one source of entangled photons and one fixed unbalanced interferometer per phase - coded analysis basis . we show that the maximum analysis spectral bandwidth is obtained when the analysis interferometers are properly unbalanced , a strategy which can be straightforwardly applied to most of today 's experiments based on energy - time and time - bin entanglement . our scheme has therefore a great potential for boosting bit rates and reducing the resource overhead of future entanglement - based quantum key distribution systems .
