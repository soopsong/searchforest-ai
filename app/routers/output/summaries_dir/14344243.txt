a smooth function of the second moments of $ n$ continuous variables gives rise to an uncertainty relation if it is bounded from below . we present a method to systematically derive such bounds by generalizing an approach applied previously to a single continuous variable . new uncertainty relations are obtained for multi - partite systems which allow one to distinguish entangled from separable states . we also investigate the geometry of the"uncertainty region"in the $ n(2n+1)$-dimensional space of moments . it is shown to be a convex set for any number continuous variables , and the points on its boundary found to be in one - to - one correspondence with pure gaussian states of minimal uncertainty . for a single degree of freedom , the boundary can be visualized as one sheet of a"lorentz - invariant"hyperboloid in the three - dimensional pace of second moments .
