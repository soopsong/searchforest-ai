we study the non - equilibrium transport properties of a highly anisotropic two - dimensional lattice of spin-1/2 particles governed by a heisenberg xxz hamiltonian . the anisotropy of the lattice allows us to approximate the system at finite temperature as an array of incoherently coupled one - dimensional chains . we show that in the regime of strong intrachain interactions , the weak interchain coupling considerably boosts spin transport in the driven system . interestingly , we show that this enhancement increases with the length of the chains , which is related to superdiffusive spin transport . we describe the mechanism behind this effect , compare it to a similar phenomenon in single chains induced by dephasing , and explain why the former is much stronger .
