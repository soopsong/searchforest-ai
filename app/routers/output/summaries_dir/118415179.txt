we present the born - markov approximated redfield quantum master equation ( rqme ) description for an open system of non - interacting particles ( bosons or fermions ) on an arbitrary lattice of $ n$ sites in any dimension and weakly connected to multiple reservoirs at different temperatures and chemical potentials . the rqme can be reduced to the lindblad equation , of various forms , by making further approximations . by studying the $ n=2 $ case , we show that rqme gives results which agree with exact analytical results for steady state properties and with exact numerics for time - dependent properties , over a wide range of parameters . in comparison , the lindblad equations have a limited domain of validity in non - equilibrium . we conclude that it is indeed justified to use microscopically derived full rqme to go beyond the limitations of lindblad equations in out - of - equilibrium systems . we also derive closed form analytical results for out - of - equilibrium time dynamics of two - point correlation functions . these results explicitly show the approach to steady state and thermalization . these results are experimentally relevant for cold atoms , cavity qed and far - from - equilibrium quantum dot experiments .
