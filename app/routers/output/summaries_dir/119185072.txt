non - gaussian states and operations are crucial for various continuous - variable quantum information processing tasks . to quantitatively understand non - gaussianity beyond states , we establish a resource theory for non - gaussian operations . in our framework , we consider gaussian operations as free operations , and non - gaussian operations as resources . we define entanglement - assisted non - gaussianity generating power and show that it is a monotone that is non - increasing under the set of free super - operations , i.e. , concatenation and tensoring with gaussian channels . for conditional unitary maps , this monotone can be analytically calculated . as examples , we show that the non - gaussianity of ideal photon - number subtraction and photon - number addition equal the non - gaussianity of the single - photon fock state . based on our non - gaussianity monotone , we divide non - gaussian operations into two classes : ( 1 ) the finite non - gaussianity class , e.g. , photon - number subtraction , photon - number addition and all gaussian - dilatable non - gaussian channels ; and ( 2 ) the diverging non - gaussianity class , e.g. , the binary phase - shift channel and the kerr nonlinearity . this classification also implies that not all non - gaussian channels are exactly gaussian - dilatable . our resource theory enables a quantitative characterization and a first classification of non - gaussian operations , paving the way towards the full understanding of non - gaussianity .
