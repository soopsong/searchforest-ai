we study the possibility of asymmetric transmission induced by a non - hermitian scattering center embedded in a one - dimensional waveguide , motivated by the aim of realizing quantum diode in a non - hermitian system . it is shown that a $ \mathcal{pt}$ symmetric non - hermitian scattering center always has symmetric transmission although the dynamics within the isolated center can be unidirectional , especially at its exceptional point . we propose a concrete scheme based on a flux - controlled non - hermitian scattering center , which comprises a non - hermitian triangular ring threaded by an aharonov - bohm flux . the analytical solution shows that such a complex scattering center acts as a diode at the resonant energy level of the spectral singularity , exhibiting perfect unidirectionality of the transmission . the connections between the phenomena of the asymmetric transmission and reflectionless absorption are also discussed .
