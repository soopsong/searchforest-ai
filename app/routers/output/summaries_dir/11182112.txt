we formulate a theory for the collective phase description of oscillatory convection in hele - shaw cells . it enables us to describe the dynamics of the oscillatory convection by a single degree of freedom which we call the collective phase . the theory can be considered as a phase reduction method for limit - cycle solutions in infinite - dimensional dynamical systems , namely , stable time - periodic solutions to partial differential equations , representing the oscillatory convection . we derive the phase sensitivity function , which quantifies the phase response of the oscillatory convection to weak perturbations applied at each spatial point , and analyze the phase synchronization between two weakly coupled hele - shaw cells exhibiting oscillatory convection on the basis of the derived phase equations .
