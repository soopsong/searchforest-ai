in this paper , using an exponential function of intensity of radiation field , two new classes of nonlinear coherent states will be constructed . for the first class , we choose the nonlinearity function as f(n ) = exp(\beta n ) , where \beta characterizes the strength of the nonlinearity of the quantum system . we show that , the corresponding \beta - states possess a collection of non - classicality features , only for the particular values of \beta and z. but , interestingly there exists finite ( threshold ) values of \beta , for which all of the non - classicality signs will disappear , in appropriate regions around the origin of the complex plane ( z<|z| ) . it is then illustrated that , using this threshold ( or greater ) value of \beta , the corresponding \beta - states behave very similar to canonical coherent states , as the most classical quantum states , in approximately whole of the space . in the continuation , we motivate to find another class of nonlinear coherent states , limited to a unit disk centered at the origin , looking like the canonical coherent states in behavior , in exactly the whole range of |z|<1 . this purpose also will be achieved by considering the nonlinearity function as f(n)= exp(\lambda / n)/\sqrt{n } , where \lambda is a tunable nonlinearity parameter . the canonical coherent state 's aspects of the corresponding \lambda - states will be refreshed , in particular cases , working with a threshold ( or greater ) value of \lambda .
