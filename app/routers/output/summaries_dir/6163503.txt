single photons are an important prerequisite for a broad spectrum of quantum optical applications . we experimentally demonstrate a heralded single - photon source based on spontaneous parametric down - conversion in collinear bulk optics , and fiber - coupled bolometric transition - edge sensors . without correcting for background , losses , or detection inefficiencies , we measure an overall heralding efficiency of 83 % . by violating a bell inequality , we confirm the single - photon character and high - quality entanglement of our heralded single photons which , in combination with the high heralding efficiency , are a necessary ingredient for advanced quantum communication protocols such as one - sided device - independent quantum key distribution .
