we demonstrate sub - shot - noise photon - number correlations in a ( temporal ) multimode mesoscopic ( $ \sim 10 ^ 3 $ detected photons ) twin - beam produced by ps - pulsed spontaneous non - degenerate parametric downconversion . we have separately detected the signal and idler distributions of photons collected in twin coherence areas and found that the variance of the photon - count difference goes below the shot - noise limit by 3.25 db . the number of temporal modes contained in the twin - beam , as well as the size of the twin coherence areas , depends on the pump intensity . our scheme is based on spontaneous downconversion and thus does not suffer from limitations due to the finite gain of the parametric process . twin - beams are also used to demonstrate the conditional preparation of a nonclassical ( sub - poissonian ) state .
