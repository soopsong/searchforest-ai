small inhibitory neuronal circuits have long been identified as key neuronal motifs to generate and modulate the coexisting rhythms of various motor functions . our paper highlights the role of a cellular switching mechanism to orchestrate such circuits . the cellular switch makes the circuits reconfigurable , robust , adaptable , and externally controllable . without this cellular mechanism , the circuits rhythms entirely rely on specific tunings of the synaptic connectivity , which makes them rigid , fragile , and difficult to control externally . we illustrate those properties on the much studied architecture of a small network controlling both the pyloric and gastric rhythms of crabs . the cellular switch is provided by a slow negative conductance often neglected in mathematical modeling of central pattern generators . we propose that this conductance is simple to model and key to computational studies of rhythmic circuit neuromodulation .
