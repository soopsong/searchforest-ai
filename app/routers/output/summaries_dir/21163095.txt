in this paper we present a novel construction of an active quenching circuit intended for single photon detection . for purpose of evaluation , we have combined this circuit with a standard avalanche photodiode c30902s to form a single photon detector . a series of measurements , presented here , show that this single photon detector has a dead time of less than 40ns , maximum random counting frequency of over 14mhz , low after pulsing , detection efficiency of over 20 % and a good noise performance . this simple and robust active quenching circuit can be built from of - the - shelf electronic components and needs no complicated adjustments .
