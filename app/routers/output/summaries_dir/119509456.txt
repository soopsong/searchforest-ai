realising a global quantum network requires combining individual strengths of different quantum systems to perform universal tasks , notably using flying and stationary qubits . however , transferring coherently quantum information between different systems is challenging as they usually feature different properties , notably in terms of operation wavelength and wavepacket . to circumvent this problem for quantum photonics systems , we demonstrate a polarisation - preserving quantum frequency conversion device in which telecom wavelength photons are converted to the near infrared , at which a variety of quantum memories operate . our device is essentially free of noise which we demonstrate through near perfect single photon state transfer tomography and observation of high - fidelity entanglement after conversion . in addition , our guided - wave setup is robust , compact , and easily adaptable to other wavelengths . this approach therefore represents a major building block towards advantageously connecting quantum information systems based on light and matter .
