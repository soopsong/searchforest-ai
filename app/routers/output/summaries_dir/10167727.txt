in this paper , we define four different notions of controllability of physical interest for multilevel quantum mechanical systems . these notions involve the possibility of driving the evolution operator as well as the state of the system . we establish the connections among these different notions as well as methods to verify controllability . the paper also contains results on the relation between the controllability in arbitrary small time of a system varying on a compact transformation lie group and the corresponding system on the associated homogeneous space . as an application , we prove that , for the system of two interacting spin 1/2 particles , not every state transfer can be obtained in arbitrary small time .
