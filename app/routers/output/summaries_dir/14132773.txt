we obtain expressions for the optimal rates of one- shot entanglement manipulation under operations which generate a negligible amount of entanglement . as the optimal rates for entanglement distillation and dilution in this paradigm , we obtain the max- and min - relative entropies of entanglement , the two logarithmic robustnesses of entanglement , and smoothed versions thereof . this gives a new operational meaning to these entanglement measures . moreover , by considering the limit of many identical copies of the shared entangled state , we partially recover the recently found reversibility of entanglement manipu- lation under the class of operations which asymptotically do not generate entanglement .
