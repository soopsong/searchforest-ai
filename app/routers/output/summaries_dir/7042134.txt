quantum versions of random walks on the line and the cycle show a quadratic improvement over classical random walks in their spreading rates and mixing times respectively . non - unitary quantum walks can provide a useful optimisation of these properties , producing a more uniform distribution on the line , and faster mixing times on the cycle . we investigate the interplay between quantum and random dynamics by comparing the resources required , and examining numerically how the level of quantum correlations varies during the walk . we show numerically that the optimal non - unitary quantum walk proceeds such that the quantum correlations are nearly all removed at the point of the final measurement . this requires only o(log t ) random bits for a quantum walk of t steps
