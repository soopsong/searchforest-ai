we report the implementation of a high - rate source of single and two - photon states . by combining the advantages of short pulses and cavities , heralding rates up to 250khz with 88 % fidelity have been obtained for the single photons as well as 800hz with 82 % fidelity for the two - photon states . furthermore , we developed a setup where the homodyne measurement is conditioned by the heralding of the quantum states , enabling the detection of most of the heralded events . this allows a faster characterization of the photon source leading to an increase in the fidelities up to 91 % and 88 % respectively for the single - photon and two - photon fock states . such high rates and fidelities in the generation of elementary fock states may open the path for the production of complex quantum states .
