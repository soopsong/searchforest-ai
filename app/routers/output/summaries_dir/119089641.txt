raman interactions in alkali vapours are used in applications such as atomic clocks , optical signal processing , generation of squeezed light and raman quantum memories for temporal multiplexing . to achieve a strong interaction the alkali ensemble needs both a large optical depth and a high level of spin - polarisation . we implement a technique known as quenching using a molecular buffer gas which allows near - perfect spin - polarisation of over $ 99.5\%$ in caesium vapour at high optical depths of up to $ \sim 2 \times 10 ^ 5 $ ; a factor of 4 higher than can be achieved without quenching . we use this system to explore efficient light storage with high gain in a ghz bandwidth raman memory .
