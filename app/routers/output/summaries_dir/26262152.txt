we propose a new approach to implement quantum repeaters for long distance quantum communication . our protocol generates a backbone of encoded bell pairs and uses the procedure of classical error correction during simultaneous entanglement connection . we illustrate that the repeater protocol with simple calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) encoding can significantly extend the communication distance , while still maintaining a fast key generation rate .
