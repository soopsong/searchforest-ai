i present an explicit classical simulation of arbitrary quantum noise for quantum models in which one qubit interacts with a quantum bath . the classical model simulates the interaction of the bath and the qubit by random unitary evolutions . i show that any arbitrary quantum dynamics , including quantum dissipation , recurrence , and dephasing , can be simulated classically when one allows the unitary operators in the classical model to depend on the initial state of the system and bath . for initial mixed states of the system and non - product states of the system and bath , i demonstrate that random unitary expansion is still possible , in terms of a set of pure states .
