memcomputing is a novel paradigm of computation that utilizes dynamical elements with memory to both store and process information on the same physical location . its building blocks can be fabricated in hardware with standard electronic circuits , thus offering a path to its practical realization . in addition , since memcomputing is based on non - quantum elements , the equations of motion describing these machines can be simulated efficiently on standard computers . in fact , it was recently realized that memcomputing , and in particular its digital ( hence scalable ) version , when simulated on a classical machine provides a significant speed - up over state - of - the - art algorithms on a variety of non - convex problems . here , we stress - test the capabilities of this approach on finding approximate solutions to hard combinatorial optimization problems . these fall into a class which is known to require exponentially growing resources in the worst cases , even to generate approximations . we recently showed that in a region where state of the art algorithms demonstrate this exponential growth , simulations of digital memcomputing machines performed using the falcon$^\copyright$ simulator of memcomputing , inc . only require time and memory resources that scale linearly . these results are extended in a stress - test up to $ 64\times10 ^ 6 $ variables ( corresponding to about 1 billion literals ) , namely the largest case that we could fit on a single node with 128 gb of dram . since memcomputing can be applied to a wide variety of optimization problems , this stress test shows the considerable advantage of non - combinatorial , physics - inspired approaches over standard combinatorial ones .
