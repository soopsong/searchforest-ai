we implement two quantum approximate optimisation algorithm ( qaoa ) variants for a battery revenue optimisation problem , equivalent to the weakly np - hard knapsack problem . both approaches investigate how to tackle constrained problems with qaoa . a first ' constrained ' approach introduces a quadratic penalty to enforce the constraint to be respected strictly and reformulates the problem into an ising problem . however , simulations on ibm 's simulator highlight non - convergent results for intermediate depth ( $ p\leq 50 $ ) . a second ' relaxed ' approach applies the qaoa with a non - ising target function to compute a linear penalty , running in time $ o(p(\log_2 n)^3)$ and needing $ o(n \log n)$ qubits . simulations reveal an exponential improvement over the number of depth levels and obtain approximations about $ 0.95 $ of the optimum with shallow depth ( $ p \leq 10 $ ) .
