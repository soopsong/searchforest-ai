we study the ergodicity of finite - dimensional approximations of the schr\"odinger equation . the system is driven by a multiplicative scalar noise . under general assumptions over the distribution of the noise , we show that the system has a unique stationary measure $ \mu$ on the unit sphere $ s$ in $ \c^n$ , and $ \mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the riemannian volume on $ s$. moreover , for any initial condition in $ s$ , the solution converges exponentially fast to the measure $ \mu$ in the variational norm .
