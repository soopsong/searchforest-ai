the continuous - variable measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution ( cv - mdi - qkd ) is a promising candidate for the immunity to side - channel attacks , but unfortunately seems to face the limitation of transmission distance in contrast to discrete - variable ( dv ) counterpart . in this paper , we suggest a method of improving the performance of cv - mdi - qkd involving the achievable secret key rate and transmission distance by using zero - photon catalysis ( zpc ) , which is indeed a noiseless attenuation process . the numerical stimulation results show that the transmission distance of zpc - based cv - mdi - qkd under the extreme asymmetric case is better than that of the original protocol . attractively , in contrast to the previous single - photon subtraction ( sps)-based cv - mdi - qkd , the proposed scheme enables a higher secret key rate and a longer transmission distance . in particular , the zpc - based cv - mdi - qkd can tolerate more imperfections of detectors than both the original protocol and the sps - based cv - mdi - qkd .
