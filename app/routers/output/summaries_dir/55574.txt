we consider quantum channels with two senders and one receiver . for an arbitrary such channel , we give multi - letter characterizations of two different two - dimensional capacity regions . the first region characterizes the rates at which it is possible for one sender to send classical information while the other sends quantum information . the second region gives the rates at which each sender can send quantum information . we give an example of a channel for which each region has a single - letter description , concluding with a characterization of the rates at which each user can simultaneously send classical and quantum information .
