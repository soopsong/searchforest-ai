we study the ground - state space properties for frustration - free hamiltonians . we introduce a concept of ` reduced spaces ' to characterize local structures of ground - state spaces . for a many - body system , we characterize mathematical structures for the set $ \theta_k$ of all the $ k$-particle reduced spaces , which with a binary operation called join forms a semilattice that can be interpreted as an abstract convex structure . the smallest nonzero elements in $ \theta_k$ , called atoms , are analogs of extreme points . we study the properties of atoms in $ \theta_k$ and discuss its relationship with ground states of $ k$-local frustration - free hamiltonians . for spin-1/2 systems , we show that all the atoms in $ \theta_2 $ are unique ground states of some 2-local frustration - free hamiltonians . moreover , we show that the elements in $ \theta_k$ may not be the join of atoms , indicating a richer structure for $ \theta_k$ beyond the convex structure . our study of $ \theta_k$ deepens the understanding of ground - state space properties for frustration - free hamiltonians , from a new angle of reduced spaces .
