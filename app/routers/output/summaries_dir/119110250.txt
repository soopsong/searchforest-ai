we show that it is possible to estimate the shape of an object by measuring only the fluctuations of a probing field , allowing us to expose the object to a minimal light intensity . this scheme , based on noise measurements through homodyne detection , is useful in the regime where the number of photons is low enough that direct detection with a photodiode is difficult but high enough such that photon counting is not an option . we generate a few - photon state of multi - spatial - mode vacuum - squeezed twin beams using four - wave mixing and direct one of these twin fields through a binary intensity mask whose shape is to be imaged . exploiting either the classical fluctuations in a single beam or quantum correlations between the twin beams , we demonstrate that under some conditions quantum correlations can provide an enhancement in sensitivity when estimating the shape of the object .
