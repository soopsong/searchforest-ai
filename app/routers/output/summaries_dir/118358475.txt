matchgates are a restricted set of two - qubit gates known to be classically simulable under particular conditions . specifically , if a circuit consists only of nearest - neighbour matchgates , an efficient classical simulation is possible if either ( i ) the input is a computational basis state and the simulation requires computing probabilities of multi - qubit outcomes ( including also adaptive measurements ) , or ( ii ) if the input is an arbitrary product state , but the output of the circuit consists of a single qubit . in this paper we extend these results to show that matchgates are classically simulable even in the most general combination of these settings , namely , if the inputs are arbitrary product states , if the measurements are over arbitrarily many output qubits , and if adaptive measurements are allowed . this remains true even for arbitrary single - qubit measurements , albeit only in a weaker notion of classical simulation . these results make for an interesting contrast with other restricted models of computation , such as clifford circuits or ( bosonic ) linear optics , where the complexity of simulation varies greatly under similar modifications .
