coupled resonator arrays have been shown to exhibit interesting many- body physics including mott and fractional hall states of photons . one of the main differences between these photonic quantum simulators and their cold atoms coun- terparts is in the dissipative nature of their photonic excitations . the natural equi- librium state is where there are no photons left in the cavity . pumping the system with external drives is therefore necessary to compensate for the losses and realise non - trivial states . the external driving here can easily be tuned to be incoherent , coherent or fully quantum , opening the road for exploration of many body regimes beyond the reach of other approaches . in this chapter , we review some of the physics arising in driven dissipative coupled resonator arrays including photon fermionisa- tion , crystallisation , as well as photonic quantum hall physics out of equilibrium . we start by briefly describing possible experimental candidates to realise coupled resonator arrays along with the two theoretical models that capture their physics , the jaynes - cummings - hubbard and bose - hubbard hamiltonians . a brief review of the analytical and sophisticated numerical methods required to tackle these systems is included .
