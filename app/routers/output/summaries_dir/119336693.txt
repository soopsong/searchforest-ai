in this paper , we study the properties of lackadaisical quantum walks on a line . this model is first proposed in~\cite{wong2015grover } as a quantum analogue of lazy random walks where each vertex is attached $ \tau$ self - loops . we derive an analytic expression for the localization probability of the walker at the origin after infinite steps , and obtain the peak velocities of the walker . we also calculate rigorously the wave function of the walker starting from the origin and obtain a long time approximation for the entire probability density function . as an application of the density function , we prove that lackadaisical quantum walks spread ballistically for arbitrary $ \tau$ , and give an analytic solution for the variance of the walker 's probability distribution .
