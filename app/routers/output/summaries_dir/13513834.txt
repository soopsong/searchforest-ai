the future of quantum communication relies on quantum networks composed by observers sharing multipartite quantum states . the certification of multipartite entanglement will be crucial to the usefulness of these networks . in many real situations it is natural to assume that some observers are more trusted than others in the sense that they have more knowledge of their measurement apparatuses . here we propose a general method to certify all kinds of multipartite entanglement in this asymmetric scenario and experimentally demonstrate it in an optical experiment . our results , which can be seen as a definition of genuine multipartite quantum steering , give a method to detect entanglement in a scenario in between the standard entanglement and fully device - independent scenarios , and provide a basis for semi - device - independent cryptographic applications in quantum networks .
