many - particle continuous - time quantum walks ( ctqws ) represent a resource for several tasks in quantum technology , including quantum search algorithms and universal quantum computation . in order to design and implement ctqws in a realistic scenario , one needs effective simulation tools for hamiltonians that take into account static noise and fluctuations in the lattice , i.e. hamiltonians containing stochastic terms . to this aim , we suggest a parallel algorithm based on the taylor series expansion of the evolution operator , and compare its performances with those of algorithms based on the exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian or a 4-th order runge - kutta integration . we prove that both taylor - series expansion and runge - kutta algorithms are reliable and have a low computational cost , the taylor - series expansion showing the additional advantage of a memory allocation not depending on the precision of calculation . both algorithms are also highly parallelizable within the simt paradigm , and are thus suitable for gpgpu computing . in turn , we have benchmarked 4 nvidia gpus and 3 quad - core intel cpus for a 2-particle system over lattices of increasing dimension , showing that the speedup providend by gpu computing , with respect to the openmp parallelization , lies in the range between 8x and ( more than ) 20x , depending on the frequency of post - processing . gpu - accelerated codes thus allow one to overcome concerns about the execution time , and make it possible simulations with many interacting particles on large lattices , with the only limit of the memory available on the device .
