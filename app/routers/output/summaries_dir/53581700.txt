squeezed states are one of the most useful quantum optical models having various applications in different areas , especially in quantum information processing . generalized squeezed states are even more interesting since , sometimes , they provide additional degrees of freedom in the system . however , they are very difficult to construct and , therefore , people explore such states for individual setting and , thus , a generic analytical expression for generalized squeezed states is yet inadequate in the literature . in this article , we propose a method for the generalization of such states , which can be utilized to construct the squeezed states for any kind of quantum models . our protocol works accurately for the case of the trigonometric rosen - morse potential , which we have considered as an example . presumably , the scheme should also work for any other quantum mechanical model . in order to verify our results , we have studied the nonclassicality of the given system using several standard mechanisms . among them , the wigner function turns out to be the most challenging from the computational point of view . we , thus , also explore a generalization of the wigner function and indicate how to compute it for a general system like the trigonometric rosen - morse potential with a reduced computation time .
