we analyze the entanglement dynamics in a nonlinear kerr - like coupler interacting with external environment . whenever the reservoir is in a thermal vacuum state , the entanglement ( measured by concurrence for a two - qubit system ) exhibits regular oscillations of decreasing amplitude . in contrast , for thermal reservoirs we can observe dark periods in concurrence oscillations ( which can be called a sudden death of the entanglement ) and the entanglement rebuild ( which can be named the sudden birth of entanglement ) . we show that these features can be observed when we deal with two - qubit system as well as qubit - qutrit system .
