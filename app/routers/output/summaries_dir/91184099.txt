ever since the appearance of the seminal work of einstein , podolsky and rosen ( the epr - paradox ) , the phenomenon of entanglement , which features the essential difference between classical and quantum physics , has received wide theoretical and experimental attentions . recently the desire to understand and create quantum entanglement between particles such as spins , photons , atoms and molecules is fueled by the development of quantum teleportation , quantum communication , quantum cryptography and quantum computation . although most of the work has focused on showing that entanglement violates the famous bell 's inequality and its generalization for discrete measurements , few recent attempts focus on continuous measurement results . here , we have developed a general practical inequality to test entanglement for continuous measurement results , particularly scattering of chemical reactions . after we explain how to implement this new inequality to classify entanglement in scattering experiments , we propose a specific chemical reaction to test the violation of this inequality . the method is general and could be used to classify entanglement for continuous measurement results .
