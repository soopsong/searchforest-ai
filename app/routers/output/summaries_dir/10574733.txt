we study the robustness and fragility of entanglement of open quantum systems in some exactly solvable models in which the decoherence is caused by a pure dephasing process . in particular , for the toy models presented in this paper , we identify two different time scales , one is responsible for local dephasing , while the other is for entanglement decay . for a class of fragile entangled states defined in this paper , we find that the entanglement of two qubits , as measured by concurrence , decays faster asymptotically than the quantum dephasing of an individual qubit .
