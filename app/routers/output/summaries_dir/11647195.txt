we use the qualitative insight of a planar neuronal phase portrait to detect an excitability switch in arbitrary conductance - based models from a simple mathematical condition . the condition expresses a balance between ion channels that provide a negative feedback at resting potential ( restorative channels ) and those that provide a positive feedback at resting potential ( regenerative channels ) . geometrically , the condition imposes a transcritical bifurcation that rules the switch of excitability through the variation of a single physiological parameter . our analysis of six different published conductance based models always finds the transcritical bifurcation and the associated switch in excitability , which suggests that the mathematical predictions have a physiological relevance and that a same regulatory mechanism is potentially involved in the excitability and signaling of many neurons .
