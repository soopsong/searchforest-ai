in the theory of quantum dynamical filtering , one of the biggest issues is that the underlying system dynamics represented by a quantum stochastic differential equation must be known exactly in order that the corresponding filter provides an optimal performance ; however , this assumption is in general unrealistic . therefore , in this paper we consider a class of linear quantum systems subject to time - varying norm - bounded parametric uncertainty and then propose a robust observer such that the variance of the estimation error is guaranteed to be within a certain bound . although the proposed observer is different from the optimal filter in the sense of the least mean square error , it is demonstrated in a typical quantum control problem that the observer is fairly robust against a parametric uncertainty even when the other estimators , the optimal kalman filter and the risk - sensitive observer , fail in the estimation due to the uncertain perturbation
