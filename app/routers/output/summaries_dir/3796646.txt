encoding information in the position of single photons has no known limits , given infinite resources . using a heralded single - photon source and a spatial light modulator ( slm ) , we steer single photons to specific positions in a virtual grid on a large - area spatially resolving photon - counting detector ( iccd ) . we experimentally demonstrate selective addressing any location ( symbol ) in a 9072 size grid ( alphabet ) to achieve 10.5 bit of mutual information between the sender and receiver per detected photon . our results set the stage for very - high - dimensional quantum information processing .
