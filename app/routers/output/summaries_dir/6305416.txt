we give an overview of different paradigms for control of quantum systems and their applications , illustrated with specific examples . we further discuss the implications of fault - tolerance requirements for quantum process engineering using optimal control , and explore the possibilities for architecture simplification and effective control using a minimum number of simple switch actuators .
