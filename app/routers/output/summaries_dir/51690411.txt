the exact factorization framework is extended and utilized to introduce the electronic - states of correlated electron - photon systems . the formal definitions of an exact scalar potential and an exact vector potential that account for the electron - photon correlation are given . inclusion of these potentials to the hamiltonian of the uncoupled electronic system leads to a purely electronic schr\"odinger equation that uniquely determines the electronic states of the complete electron - photon system . for a one - dimensional asymmetric double - well potential coupled to a single photon mode with resonance frequency , we investigate the features of the exact scalar potential . in particular , we discuss the significance of the step - and - peak structure of the exact scalar potential in describing the phenomena of photon - assisted delocalization and polaritonic squeezing of the electronic excited - states . in addition , we develop an analytical approximation for the scalar potential and demonstrate how the step - and - peak features of the exact scalar potential are captured by the proposed analytical expression .
