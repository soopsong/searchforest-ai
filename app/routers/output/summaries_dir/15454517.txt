this article provides sufficient conditions for positive maps on the schatten classes $ \mathcal j_{p } , 1\le p<\infty$ of bounded operators on a separable hilbert space such that a corresponding perron - frobenius theorem holds . with applications in quantum information theory in mind sufficient conditions are given for a trace preserving , positive map on $ \mathcal j_{1}$ , the space of trace class operators , to have a unique , strictly positive density matrix which is left invariant under the map . conversely to any given strictly positive density matrix there are trace preserving , positive maps for which the density matrix is the unique perron - frobenius vector .
