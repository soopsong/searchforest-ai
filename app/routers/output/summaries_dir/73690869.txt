wave function collapse models postulate a fundamental breakdown of the quantum superposition principle at the macroscale . therefore , experimental tests of collapse models are also fundamental tests of quantum mechanics . here , we compute the upper bounds on the collapse parameters , which can be inferred by the gravitational wave detectors ligo , lisa pathfinder , and auriga . we consider the most widely used collapse model , the continuous spontaneous localization ( csl ) model . we show that these experiments exclude a huge portion of the csl parameter space , the strongest bound being set by the recently launched space mission lisa pathfinder . we also rule out a proposal for quantum - gravity - induced decoherence .
