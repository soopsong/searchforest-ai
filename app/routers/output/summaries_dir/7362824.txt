non - stoquastic hamiltonians have both positive and negative signs in off - diagonal elements in their matrix representation in the standard computational basis and thus can not be simulated efficiently by the standard quantum monte carlo method due to the sign problem . we describe our analytical studies of this type of hamiltonians with infinite - range non - random as well as random interactions from the perspective of possible enhancement of the efficiency of quantum annealing or adiabatic quantum computing . it is shown that multi - body transverse interactions like $ xx$ and $ xxxxx$ with positive coefficients appended to a stoquastic transverse - field ising model render the hamiltonian non - stoquastic and reduce a first - order quantum phase transition in the simple transverse - field case to a second - order transition . this implies that the efficiency of quantum annealing is exponentially enhanced , because a first - order transition has an exponentially small energy gap ( and therefore exponentially long computation time ) whereas a second - order transition has a polynomially decaying gap ( polynomial computation time ) . the examples presented here represent rare instances where strong quantum effects , in the sense that they can not be efficiently simulated in the standard quantum monte carlo , have analytically been shown to exponentially enhance the efficiency of quantum annealing for combinatorial optimization problems .
