we propose a mechanism of ground - state blockade between two $ n$-type rydberg atoms in virtue of rydberg - antiblockade effect and raman transition . inspired by the quantum zeno effect , the strong rydberg antiblockade interaction plays a role in frequently measuring one ground state of two , leading to a blockade effect for double occupation of the corresponding quantum state . by encoding the logic qubits into the ground states , we efficiently avoid the spontaneous emission of the excited rydberg state , and maintain the nonlinear rydberg - rydberg interaction at the same time . as applications , we discuss in detail the feasibility of preparing two - atom and three - atom entanglement with ground - state blockade in closed system and open system , respectively , which shows that a high fidelity of entangled state can be obtained with current experimental parameters .
