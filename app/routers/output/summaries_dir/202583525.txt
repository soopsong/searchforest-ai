this paper considers one - mode open quantum harmonic oscillators with a pair of conjugate position and momentum variables driven by vacuum bosonic fields according to a linear quantum stochastic differential equation . such systems model cavity resonators in quantum optical experiments . assuming that the quadratic hamiltonian of the oscillator is specified by a positive definite energy matrix , we consider a modified version of the quantum karhunen - loeve expansion of the system variables proposed recently . the expansion employs eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the two - point commutator kernel for linearly transformed system variables . we take advantage of the specific structure of this eigenbasis in the one - mode case ( including its connection with the classical ornstein - uhlenbeck process ) . these results are applied to computing quadratic - exponential cost functionals which provide robust performance criteria for risk - sensitive control of open quantum systems .
