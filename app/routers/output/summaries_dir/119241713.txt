we calculate the full transport counting statistics in a three - terminal tunnel device with one superconducting source and two normal - metal or ferromagnet drains . we obtain the transport probability distribution from direct andreev reflection , crossed andreev reflection , and electron transfer which reveals how these processes ' statistics are determined by the device conductances . the cross - correlation noise is a result of competing contributions from crossed andreev reflection and electron transfer , as well as antibunching due to the pauli exclusion principle . for spin - active tunnel barriers that spin polarize the electron flow , crossed andreev reflection and electron transfer statistics exhibit different dependencies on the magnetization configuration , and can be controlled by relative magnetization directions and voltage bias .
