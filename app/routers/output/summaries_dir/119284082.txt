we study light induced spatial crystallization of ultracold quantum particles confined along the axis of a high-$q$ linear cavity via a transverse multicolor pump using numerical simulations . whenever a pump frequency is tuned close to resonance with a longitudinal cavity mode , the dynamics favors bistable spatial particle ordering into a bragg grating at a wavelength distance . simultaneous pumping at several resonant frequencies fosters competition between the different spatial lattice orders , exhibiting complex nonlinear field dynamics involving several metastable atom - field states . for few particles even superpositions of different spatial orders entangled with different light mode amplitudes appear . by a proper choice of trap geometry and pump frequencies a broad variety of many particle hamiltonians with a nontrivial long range coupling can be emulated in such a setup . when applying quantum monte carlo wave function simulations to study time evolution we find simultaneous super radiant scattering into several light modes and the buildup of strong non - classical atom field correlations .
