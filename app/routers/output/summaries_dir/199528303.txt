using papadodimas and raju construction of operators describing the interior of a black hole , we present a general relation between partition functions of operators describing inside and outside the black hole horizon . in particular for an eternal black hole the partition function of the interior modes may be given in terms those partition functions associated with the modes of left and right exteriors . by making use of this relation we observe that setting a finite uv cutoff will enforce us to have a cutoff behind the horizon whose value is fixed by the uv cutoff . the resultant cutoff is in agreement with what obtained in the context of holographic complexity .
