we present an empirical strategy to determine the hamiltonian dynamics of a two - qubit system using only initialization and measurement in a single fixed basis . signal parameters are estimated from measurement data using bayesian methods from which the underlying hamiltonian is reconstructed , up to three unobservable phase factors . we extend the method to achieve full control hamiltonian tomography for controllable systems via a multi - step approach . the technique is demonstrated and evaluated by analyzing data from simulated experiments including projection noise .
