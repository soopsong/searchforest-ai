a holographic dual description of inhomogeneous systems is discussed . notably , finite temperature results for the entanglement entropy in both the rainbow chain and the ssd model are obtained holographically by choosing appropriate foliations of the btz spacetime . other inhomogeneous theories are also discussed . the entanglement entropy results are verified numerically , indicating that a wide variety of inhomogeneous field theory phenomenology can be seen in different slicings of asymptotically $ ads_3 $ spacetimes .
