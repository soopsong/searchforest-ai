we consider the problem of mapping digital data encoded on a quantum register to analog amplitudes in parallel . it is shown to be unlikely that a fully unitary polynomial - time quantum algorithm exists for this problem ; np becomes a subset of bqp if it exists . in the practical point of view , we propose a nonunitary linear - time algorithm using quantum decoherence . it tacitly uses an exponentially large physical resource , which is typically a huge number of identical molecules . quantumness of correlation appearing in the process of the algorithm is also discussed .
