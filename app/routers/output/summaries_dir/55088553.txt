we show that the variance is its own concave roof . for rank-2 density matrices and operators with zero diagonal elements in the eigenbasis of the density matrix , we prove analytically that the quantum fisher information is four times the convex roof of the variance . strong numerical evidence suggests that this statement is true even for operators with nonzero diagonal elements or density matrices with a rank larger than 2 . we also find that within the different types of generalized quantum fisher information considered in [ d. petz , j. phys . a : math . gen . 35 , 929 ( 2002 ) ; p. gibilisco , f. hiai , and d. petz , ieee trans . inf . theory 55 , 439 ( 2009 ) ] , after appropriate normalization , the quantum fisher information is the largest . hence , we conjecture that the quantum fisher information is four times the convex roof of the variance even for the general case .
