we previously extended luenberger 's approach for observer design to the quantum case , and developed a class of coherent observers which tracks linear quantum stochastic systems in the sense of mean values . in light of the fact that the luenberger observer is commonly and successfully applied in classical control , it is interesting to investigate the role of coherent observers in quantum feedback . as the first step in exploring observer - based coherent control , in this paper we study pole - placement techniques for quantum systems using coherent observers , and in such a fashion , poles of a closed - loop quantum system can be relocated at any desired locations . in comparison to classical feedback control design incorporating the luenberger observer , here direct coupling between a quantum plant and the observer - based controller are allowed to enable a greater degree of freedom for the design of controller parameters . a separation principle is presented , and we show how to design the observer and feedback independently to be consistent with the laws of quantum mechanics . the proposed scheme is applicable to coherent feedback control of quantum systems , especially when the transient dynamic response is of interest , and this issue is illustrated in an example .
