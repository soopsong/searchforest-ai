an optical source that produces single photon pulses on demand has potential applications in linear optics quantum computation , provided that stringent requirements on indistinguishability and collection efficiency of the generated photons are met . we show that these are conflicting requirements for anharmonic emitters that are incoherently pumped via reservoirs . as a model for a coherently pumped single photon source , we consider cavity - assisted spin - flip raman transitions in a single charged quantum dot embedded in a microcavity . we demonstrate that using such a source , arbitrarily high collection efficiency and indistinguishability of the generated photons can be obtained simultaneously with increased cavity coupling . we analyze the role of errors that arise from distinguishability of the single photon pulses in linear optics quantum gates by relating the gate fidelity to the strength of the two - photon interference dip in photon cross - correlation measurements . we find that performing controlled phase operations with error<1 % requires nano - cavities with purcell factors f_p>= 40 in the absence of dephasing , without necessitating the strong coupling limit .
