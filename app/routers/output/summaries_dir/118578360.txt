we demonstrate site - resolved imaging of individual bosonic $ ^{174}\mathrm{yb}$ atoms in a hubbard - regime two - dimensional optical lattice with a short lattice constant of 266 nm . to suppress the heating by probe light with the $ ^1s_0$-$^1p_1 $ transition of the wavelength $ \lambda$ = 399 nm for high - resolution imaging and preserve atoms at the same lattice sites during the fluorescence imaging , we simultaneously cool atoms by additionally applying narrow - line optical molasses with the $ ^1s_0$-$^3p_1 $ transition of the wavelength $ \lambda$ = 556 nm . we achieve a low temperature of $ t = 7.4(1.3)\ \mu\mathrm{k}$ , corresponding to a mean oscillation quantum number along the horizontal axes of 0.22(4 ) during imaging process . we detect on average 200 fluorescence photons from a single atom within 400 ms exposure time , and estimate the detection fidelity of 87(2)% . the realization of a quantum gas microscope with enough fidelity for yb atoms in a hubbard - regime optical lattice opens up the possibilities for studying various kinds of quantum many - body systems such as bose and fermi gases , and their mixtures , and also long - range - interacting systems such as rydberg states .
