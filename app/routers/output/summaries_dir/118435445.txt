we propose a procedure to reconstruct characteristic features of an unknown stochastic system from the long - time full counting statistics of some of the system 's transitions that are monitored by a detector . the full counting statistics is conveniently parametrized by so - called generalized factorial cumulants . taking only a few of them as input information is sufficient to reconstruct important features such as the lower bound of the system dimension and the full spectrum of relaxation rates . the use of generalized factorial cumulants reveals system dimensions and rates that are hidden for ordinary cumulants . we illustrate the inverse counting - statistics procedure for two model systems : a single - level quantum dot in a zeeman field and a single - electron box subjected to sequential and andreev tunneling .
