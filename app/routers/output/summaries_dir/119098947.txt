quantum buoyancy has been proposed as the mechanism protecting the generalized second law when an entropy -- bearing object is slowly lowered towards a black hole and then dropped in . we point out that the original derivation of the buoyant force from a fluid picture of the acceleration radiation is invalid unless the object is almost at the horizon , because otherwise typical wavelengths in the radiation are larger than the object . the buoyant force is here calculated from the diffractive scattering of waves off the object , and found to be weaker than in the original theory . as a consequence , the argument justifying the generalized second law from buoyancy can not be completed unless the optimal drop point is next to the horizon . the universal bound on entropy is always a sufficient condition for operation of the generalized second law , and can be derived from that law when the optimal drop point is close to the horizon . we also compute the quantum buoyancy of an elementary charged particle ; it turns out to be negligible for energetic considerations . finally , we speculate on the significance of the absence from the bound of any mention of the number of particle species in nature .
