given an arbitrary measurement over a system of interest , the outcome of a posterior measurement can be used for improving the statistical estimation of the system state after the former measurement . here , we realize an informational - entropic study of this kind of ( bayesian ) retrodicted quantum measurement formulated in the context of quantum state smoothing . we show that the ( average ) entropy of the system state after the retrodicted measurement ( smoothed state ) is bounded from below and above by the entropies of the first measurement when performed in a selective and non - selective standard predictive ways respectively . for bipartite systems the same property is also valid for each subsystem . their mutual information , in the case of a former single projective measurement , is also bounded in a similar way . the corresponding inequalities provide a kind of retrodicted extension of holevo bound for quantum communication channels . these results quantify how much information gain is obtained through retrodicted quantum measurements in quantum state smoothing . while an entropic reduction is always granted , in bipartite systems mutual information may be degraded . relevant physical examples confirm these features .
