quantum gaussian states can be considered as the majority of the practical quantum states used in quantum communications and more generally in quantum information . here we consider their properties in relation with the geometrically uniform symmetry , a property of quantum states that greatly simplifies the derivation of the optimal decision by means of the square root measurements . in a general framework of the $ n$-mode gaussian states we show the general properties of this symmetry and the application of the optimal quantum measurements . an application example is presented , to quantum communication systems employing pulse position modulation . we prove that the geometrically uniform symmetry can be applied to the general class of multimode gaussian states .
