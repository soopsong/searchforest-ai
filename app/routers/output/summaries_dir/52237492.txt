we analyze the propagation of quantum states in the presence of weak disorder . in particular , we investigate the reliable transmittance of quantum states , as potential carriers of quantum information , through disorder - perturbed waveguides . we quantify wave - packet distortion , backscattering , and disorder - induced dephasing , which all act detrimentally on transport , and identify conditions for reliable transmission . our analysis relies on the treatment of the nonequilibrium dynamics of ensemble - averaged quantum states in terms of quantum master equations .
