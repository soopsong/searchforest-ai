this paper is concerned with linear quantum networks of $ n$ nondegenerate optical parametric amplifiers ( nopas ) , with $ n$ up to 6 , which are interconnected in a coherent feedback chain . each network connects two communicating parties ( alice and bob ) over two transmission channels . in previous work we have shown that a dual - nopa coherent feedback network generates better einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) entanglement ( i.e. , more two - mode squeezing ) between its two outgoing gaussian fields than a single nopa , when the same total pump power is consumed and the systems undergo the same transmission losses over the same distance . this paper aims to analyze stability , epr entanglement between two outgoing fields of interest , and bipartite entanglement of two - mode gaussian states of cavity modes of the $ n$-nopa networks under the effect of transmission and amplification losses , as well as time delays . it is numerically shown that , in the absence of losses and delays , the network with more nopas in the chain requires less total pump power to generate the same degree of epr entanglement . moreover , we report on the internal entanglement synchronization that occurs in the steady state between certain pairs of gaussian oscillator modes inside the nopa cavities of the networks .
