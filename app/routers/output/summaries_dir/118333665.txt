we propose an approach to quantum computing in which quantum gate strengths are parametrized by quantum degrees of freedom , and the capability of the quantum computer to perform desired tasks is monitored and gradually improved by successive feedback modifications of the coupling strength parameters . our proposal aims at experimental implementation , scalable to computational problems too large to be simulated theoretically , and we demonstrate feasibility of our proposal with simulations on search and factoring algorithms .
