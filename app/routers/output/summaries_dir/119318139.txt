we construct the photon added coherent states of a noncommutative harmonic oscillator associated to a $ q$-deformed oscillator algebra . various nonclassical properties of the corresponding system are explored , first , by studying two different types of higher order quadrature squeezing , namely the hillery - type and the hong -- mandel - type and , second , by testing the sub - poissonian nature of photon statistics in higher order with the help of the correlation function and the mandel parameter . by comparing our results with those of the usual harmonic oscillator , we notice that the quadratures and photon number distributions in noncommutative case are more squeezed for the same values of the parameters and , thus , the photon added coherent states of noncommutative harmonic oscillator may be more nonclassical in comparison to the ordinary harmonic oscillator .
