we present a new approach to long range coupling based on a combination of adiabatic passage and lateral leakage in thin shallow ridge waveguides on a silicon photonic platform . the approach enables transport of light between two isolated waveguides through a mode of the silicon slab that acts as an optical bus . due to the nature of the adiabatic protocol , the bus mode has minimal population and the transport is highly robust . we prove the concept and examine the robustness of this approach using rigorous modelling . we further demonstrate the utility of the approach by coupling power between two waveguides whilst bypassing an intermediate waveguide . this concept could form the basis of a new interconnect technology for silicon integrated photonic chips .
