we present the realization of a physical quantum random number generator based on the process of splitting a beam of photons on a beam splitter , a quantum mechanical source of true randomness . by utilizing either a beam splitter or a polarizing beam splitter , single photon detectors and high speed electronics the presented devices are capable of generating a binary random signal with an autocorrelation time of 11.8 ns and a continuous stream of random numbers at a rate of 1 mbit / s . the randomness of the generated signals and numbers is shown by running a series of tests upon data samples . the devices described in this paper are built into compact housings and are simple to operate .
