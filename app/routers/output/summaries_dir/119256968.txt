we propose nonreciprocal phonon lasing in a coupled cavity system composed of an optomechanical and a spinning resonator . we show that the optical sagnac effect leads to significant modifications in both the mechanical gain and the power threshold for phonon lasing . more importantly , the phonon lasing in this system is unidirectional , that is the phonon lasing takes place when the coupled system is driven in one direction but not the other . our work establishes the potential of spinning optomechanical devices for low - power mechanical isolation and unidirectional amplification . this provides a new route , well within the reach of current experimental abilities , to operate cavity optomechanics devices for such a wide range of applications as directional phonon switches , invisible sound sensing , and topological or chiral acoustics .
