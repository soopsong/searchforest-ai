the relative entropy is a principal measure of distinguishability in quantum information theory , with its most important property being that it is non - increasing with respect to noisy quantum operations . here , we establish a remainder term for this inequality that quantifies how well one can recover from a loss of information by employing a rotated petz recovery map . the main approach for proving this refinement is to combine the methods of [ fawzi and renner , arxiv:1410.0664 ] with the notion of a relative typical subspace from [ bjelakovic and siegmund - schultze , arxiv : quant - ph/0307170 ] . our paper constitutes partial progress towards a remainder term which features just the petz recovery map ( not a rotated petz map ) , a conjecture which would have many consequences in quantum information theory . a well known result states that the monotonicity of relative entropy with respect to quantum operations is equivalent to each of the following inequalities : strong subadditivity of entropy , concavity of conditional entropy , joint convexity of relative entropy , and monotonicity of relative entropy with respect to partial trace . we show that this equivalence holds true for refinements of all these inequalities in terms of the petz recovery map . so either all of these refinements are true or all are false .
