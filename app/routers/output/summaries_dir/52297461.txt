quantum theory provides an extremely accurate description of fundamental processes in physics . it thus seems likely that the theory is applicable beyond the , mostly microscopic , domain in which it has been tested experimentally . here we propose a gedankenexperiment to investigate the question whether quantum theory can , in principle , have universal validity . the idea is that , if the answer was yes , it must be possible to employ quantum theory to model complex systems that include agents who are themselves using quantum theory . analysing the experiment under this presumption , we find that one agent , upon observing a particular measurement outcome , must conclude that another agent has predicted the opposite outcome with certainty . the agents ' conclusions , although all derived within quantum theory , are thus inconsistent . this indicates that quantum theory can not be extrapolated to complex systems , at least not in a straightforward manner .
