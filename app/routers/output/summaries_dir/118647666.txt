integrated optics has brought unprecedented levels of stability and performance to quantum photonic circuits . however , integrated devices are not merely micron - scale equivalents of their bulk - optics counterparts . by exploiting the inherently dispersive characteristics of the integrated setting , such devices can play a remarkably more versatile role in quantum circuit architectures . we show this by examining the implications of linear dispersion in an ordinary directional coupler . dispersion unlocks several novel capabilities for this device , including in - situ control over photon spectral and polarization entanglement , tunable photon time - ordering , and entanglement - sensitive two - photon coincidence generation . also revealed is an ability to maintain perfect two - photon anti - coalescence while tuning the interference visibility , which has no equivalent in bulk - optics . the outcome of this work adds to a suite of state engineering and characterization tools that benefit from the advantages of integration . it also paves the way for re - evaluating the possibilities offered by dispersion in other on - chip devices .
