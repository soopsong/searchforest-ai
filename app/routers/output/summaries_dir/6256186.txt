the interest in memristors has risen due to their possible application both as memory units and as computational devices in combination with cmos . this is in part due to their nonlinear dynamics , and a strong dependence on the circuit topology . we provide evidence that also purely memristive circuits can be employed for computational purposes . in the present paper we show that a polynomial lyapunov function in the memory parameters exists for the case of dc controlled memristors . such lyapunov function can be asymptotically approximated with binary variables , and mapped to quadratic combinatorial optimization problems . this also shows a direct parallel between memristive circuits and the hopfield - little model . in the case of erdos - renyi random circuits , we show numerically that the distribution of the matrix elements of the projectors can be roughly approximated with a gaussian distribution , and that it scales with the inverse square root of the number of elements . this provides an approximated but direct connection with the physics of disordered system and , in particular , of mean field spin glasses . using this and the fact that the interaction is controlled by a projector operator on the loop space of the circuit . we estimate the number of stationary points of the approximate lyapunov function and provide a scaling formula as an upper bound in terms of the circuit topology only .
