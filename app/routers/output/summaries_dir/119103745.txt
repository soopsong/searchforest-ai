we propose a set of photonic crystals that realize a nonlinear quantum rabi model equivalent to a two - level system driven by the phase of a quantized electromagnetic field . the crystals are exactly soluble in the weak - coupling regime and their dispersion relation is discrete . the system is diagonalized by normal modes equivalent to a dressed state basis . in the strong - coupling regime , we use perturbation theory and find that the dispersion relation is continuous and give the normal modes of the crystal in terms of continued fractions . we show that these photonic crystals allow state reconstruction in the form of coherent oscillations in the weak - coupling regime .
