in this short paper we compute the various bipartite quantum correlations in the presence of the $ ( 4+n)$-dimensional schwarzschild black hole . in particular , we focus on the $ n$-dependence of various bosonic bipartite entanglements . for the case between alice and rob , where the former is free falling observer and the latter is at the near - horizon region , the quantum correlation is degraded compared to the case in the absence of the black hole . the degradation rate increases with decreasing $ n$. we also compute the physically inaccessible correlations . it is found that there is no creation of quantum correlation between alice and antirob . for the case between rob and antirob the quantum entanglement is created although they are separated in the causally disconnected regions . it is found that contrary to the physically accessible correlation the entanglement between rob and antirob decreases with decreasing $ n$.
