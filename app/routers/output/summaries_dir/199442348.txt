the goal of teleportation is to transfer the state of one particle to another particle . in coined quantum walks , conditional shift operators can introduce entanglement between position space and coin space . this entanglement resource can be used as a quantum channel for teleportation , as proposed by wang , shang and xue [ quantum inf . process . 16 , 221 ( 2017 ) ] . here , we demonstrate the implementation of quantum teleportation using quantum walks on a five - qubit quantum computer and a 32-qubit simulator provided by ibm quantum experience beta platform . we show the teleportation of single - qubit , two - qubit and three - qubit quantum states with circuit implementation on the quantum devices . the teleportation of bell , w and ghz states has also been demonstrated as special cases of the above states .
