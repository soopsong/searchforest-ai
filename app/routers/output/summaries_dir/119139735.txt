we find that real and complex bohmian quantum trajectories resulting from well - localized klauder coherent states in the quasi - poissonian regime possess qualitatively the same type of trajectories as those obtained from a purely classical analysis of the corresponding hamilton - jacobi equation . in the complex cases treated the quantum potential results to a constant , such that the agreement is exact . for the real cases we provide conjectures for analytical solutions for the trajectories as well as the corresponding quantum potentials . the overall qualitative behaviour is governed by the mandel parameter determining the regime in which the wavefunctions evolve as soliton like structures . we demonstrate these features explicitly for the harmonic oscillator and the poeschl - teller potential .
