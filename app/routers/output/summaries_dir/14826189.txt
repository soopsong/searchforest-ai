entanglement has been termed a critical resource for quantum information processing and is thought to be the reason that certain quantum algorithms , such as shor 's factoring algorithm , can achieve exponentially better performance than their classical counterparts . the nature of this resource is still not fully understood : here we use numerical simulation to investigate how entanglement between register qubits varies as shor 's algorithm is run on a quantum computer . the shifting patterns in the entanglement are found to relate to the choice of basis for the quantum fourier transform .
