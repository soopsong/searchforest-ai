we propose a method for preparing mixed quantum states of arbitrary dimension $ d$ ( $ d\geq2 $ ) which are codified in the discretized transverse momentum and position of single photons , once they are sent through an aperture with $ d$ slits . following our previous technique we use a programmable single phase - only spatial light modulator ( slm ) to define the aperture and set the complex transmission amplitude of each slit , allowing the independent control of the complex coefficients that define the quantum state . since these slms give us the possibility to dynamically varying the complex coefficients of the state during the measurement time , we can generate not only pure states but also quantum states compatible with a mixture of pure quantum states . therefore , by using these apertures varying on time according to a probability distribution , we have experimentally obtained $ d$-dimensional quantum states with purities that depend on the parameters of the distribution through a clear analytical expression . this fact allows us to easily customize the states to be generated . moreover , the method offer the possibility of working without changing the optical setup between pure and mixed states , or when the dimensionality of the states is increased . the obtained results show a quite good performance of our method at least up to dimension $ d=11 $ , being the fidelity of the prepared states $ f>0.98 $ in every case .
