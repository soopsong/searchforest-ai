in this paper , a novel method of quantum image rotation ( qir ) based on shear transformations on neqr quantum images is proposed . to compute the horizontal and vertical shear mappings required for rotation , we have designed quantum self - adder , quantum control multiplier , and quantum interpolation circuits as the basic computing units in the qir implementation . furthermore , we provide several examples of our results by presenting computer simulation experiments of qir under $ 30^\circ$ , $ 45^\circ$ , and $ 60^\circ$ rotation scenarios and have a discussion onto the anti - aliasing and computational complexity of the proposed qir method .
