we present qhipster , the quantum high performance software testing environment . qhipster is a distributed high - performance implementation of a quantum simulator on a classical computer , that can simulate general single - qubit gates and two - qubit controlled gates . we perform a number of single- and multi - node optimizations , including vectorization , multi - threading , cache blocking , as well as overlapping computation with communication . using the tacc stampede supercomputer , we simulate quantum circuits ( " quantum software " ) of up to 40 qubits . we carry out a detailed performance analysis to show that our simulator achieves both high performance and high hardware efficiency , limited only by the sustainable memory and network bandwidth of the machine .
