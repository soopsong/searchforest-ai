we present a robust method for quantum process tomography , which yields a set of lindblad operators that optimally fit the measured density operators at a sequence of time points . the benefits of this method are illustrated using a set of liquid - state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements on a molecule containing two coupled hydrogen nuclei , which are sufficient to fully determine its relaxation superoperator . it was found that the complete positivity constraint , which is necessary for the existence of the lindblad operators , was also essential for obtaining a robust fit to the measurements . the general approach taken here promises to be broadly useful in studying dissipative quantum processes in many of the diverse experimental systems currently being developed for quantum information processing purposes .
