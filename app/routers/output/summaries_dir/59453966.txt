verification is a task to check whether a given quantum state is close to an ideal state or not . in this paper , we show that a variety of many - qubit quantum states can be verified with only sequential single - qubit measurements of pauli operators . first , we introduce a protocol for verifying ground states of hamiltonians . we next explain how to verify quantum states generated by a certain class of quantum circuits . we finally propose an adaptive test of stabilizers that enables the verification of all polynomial - time - generated hypergraph states , which include output states of the bremner - montanaro - shepherd - type instantaneous quantum polynomial time ( iqp ) circuits . importantly , we do not make any assumption that the identically and independently distributed copies of the same states are given : our protocols work even if some highly complicated entanglement is created among copies in any artificial way . as applications , we consider the verification of the quantum computational supremacy demonstration with iqp models , and verifiable blind quantum computing .
