we report on the measurement of topological invariants in an electromagnetic topological insulator analog formed by a microwave network , consisting of the winding numbers of scattering matrix eigenvalues . the experiment can be regarded as a variant of a topological pump , with non - zero winding implying the existence of topological edge states . in microwave networks , unlike most other systems exhibiting topological insulator physics , the winding can be directly observed . the effects of loss on the experimental results , and on the topological edge states , is discussed .
