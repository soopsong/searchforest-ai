we introduce a new distance - based measure for the nonclassicality of the states of a bosonic field , which outperforms the existing such measures in several ways . we define for that purpose the operator ordering sensitivity of the state which evaluates the sensitivity to operator ordering of the renyi entropy of its quasi - probabilities and which measures the oscillations in its wigner function . through a sharp control on the operator ordering sensitivity of classical states we obtain a precise geometric image of their location in the density matrix space allowing us to introduce a distance - based measure of nonclassicality . we analyse the link between this nonclassicality measure and a recently introduced quantum macroscopicity measure , showing how the two notions are distinct .
