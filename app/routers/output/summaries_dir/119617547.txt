we approach multipartite entanglement classification in the symmetric subspace in terms of algebraic geometry , its natural language . we show that the class of symmetric separable states has the structure of a veronese variety and that its $ k$-secant varieties are slocc invariants . thus slocc classes gather naturally into families . this classification presents useful properties such as a linear growth of the number of families with the number of particles , and nesting , i.e. upward consistency of the classification . we attach physical meaning to this classification through the required interaction length of parent hamiltonians . we show that the states $ w_n$ and ghz$_n$ are in the same secant family and that , effectively , the former can be obtained in a limit from the latter . this limit is understood in terms of tangents , leading to a refinement of the previous families . we compute explicitly the classification of symmetric states with $ n\leq 4 $ qubits in terms of both secant families and its refinement using tangents . this paves the way to further use of projective varieties in algebraic geometry to solve open problems in entanglement theory .
