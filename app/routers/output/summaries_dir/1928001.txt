i review and expand the model of quantum associative memory that i have recently proposed . in this model binary patterns of n bits are stored in the quantum superposition of the appropriate subset of the computational basis of n qbits . information can be retrieved by performing an input - dependent rotation of the memory quantum state within this subset and measuring the resulting state . the amplitudes of this rotated memory state are peaked on those stored patterns which are closest in hamming distance to the input , resulting in a high probability of measuring a memory pattern very similar to it . the accuracy of pattern recall can be tuned by adjusting a parameter playing the role of an effective temperature . this model solves the well - known capacity shortage problem of classical associative memories , providing an exponential improvement in capacity . the price to pay is the probabilistic nature of information retrieval , a feature that , however , this model shares with our own brain .
