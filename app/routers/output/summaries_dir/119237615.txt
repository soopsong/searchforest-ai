in this paper , we show reduction methods for search algorithms on graphs using quantum walks . by using a graph partitioning method called equitable partition for the the given graph , we determine"effective subspace"for the search algorithm to reduce the size of the problem . we introduce the equitable partition for quantum walk based search algorithms and show how to determine"effective subspace"and reduced operator .
