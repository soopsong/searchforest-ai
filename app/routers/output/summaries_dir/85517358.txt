in a multipartite scenario quantum entanglement manifests its most dramatic form when the state is genuinely entangled . such a state is more beneficial for information theoretic applications if it contains distillable entanglement in every bipartition . it is , therefore , of significant operational interest to identify subspaces of multipartite quantum systems that contain such properties apriori . in this letter , we introduce the notion of unextendible biseparable bases ( ubb ) that provides an adequate method to construct genuinely entangled subspaces ( ges ) . we provide an explicit construction of two types of ubbs -- party symmetric and party asymmetric -- for every $ 3$-{\it qudit } quantum system , with local dimension d\ge 3 . further , we show that the ges resulting from the symmetric construction is indeed a { \it bidistillable } subspace , i.e. , all the states supported on it contain distillable entanglement across every bipartition .
