we demonstrate an efficient fiber - coupled source of nondegenerate polarization entangled photons at 795 and 1609 nm using bidirectionally pumped parametric down - conversion in bulk periodically poled lithium niobate . the single - mode source has an inferred bandwidth of 50 ghz and a spectral brightness of 300 pairs / s / ghz / mw of pump power that is suitable for narrowband applications such as entanglement transfer from photonic to atomic qubits .
