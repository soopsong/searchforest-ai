we study the small mass limit ( or : the smoluchowski - kramers limit ) of a class of quantum brownian motions with inhomogeneous damping and diffusion . for ohmic bath spectral density with a lorentz - drude cutoff , we derive the heisenberg - langevin equations for the particle 's observables using a quantum stochastic calculus approach . we set the mass of the particle to equal $ m = m_{0 } \epsilon$ , the reduced planck constant to equal $ \hbar = \epsilon$ and the cutoff frequency to equal $ \lambda = e_{\lambda}/\epsilon$ , where $ m_0 $ and $ e_{\lambda}$ are positive constants , so that the particle 's de broglie wavelength and the largest energy scale of the bath are fixed as $ \epsilon \to 0$. we study the limit as $ \epsilon \to 0 $ of the rescaled model and derive a limiting equation for the ( slow ) particle 's position variable . we find that the limiting equation contains several drift correction terms , the quantum noise - induced drifts , including terms of purely quantum nature , with no classical counterparts .
