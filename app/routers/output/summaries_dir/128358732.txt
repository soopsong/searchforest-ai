this paper focuses on the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm , which is a core subroutine in quantum computation for various applications . the conventional approach for amplitude estimation is to use the phase estimation algorithm which consists of many controlled amplification operations followed by the quantum fourier transform . the whole procedure is however hard to implement with current and near - term quantum computers . in this paper , we propose a quantum amplitude estimation algorithm without the use of expensive controlled operations ; the key idea is to employ the maximum likelihood estimation based on the combined measurement data produced from quantum circuits with different numbers of amplitude amplification operations . numerical simulations demonstrate that our algorithm asymptotically achieves nearly the optimal quantum speedup yet with reasonable circuit length .
