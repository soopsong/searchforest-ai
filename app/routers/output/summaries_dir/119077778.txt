we examine entanglement dynamics via concurrence among four two - state systems labeled $ a , ~a , ~b , ~b$. the four systems are arranged on an addressable"lattice"in such a way that $ a$ and $ a$ at one location labeled $ aa$ can interact with each other via excitation exchange , and the same for $ b$ and $ b$ at location $ bb$. the $ aa$ location is prepared entangled with the $ bb$ location , but their mutual complete isolation prevents interaction in the interval between actions of an external addressing agent . there are six pairwise concurrences on the lattice , and we follow their evolution in the interval between external actions . we show how entanglement evolves and may exhibit the non - analytic effect termed entanglement sudden death ( esd ) , with periodic recovery . these loss and gain processes may be interpreted as entanglement transfer between the subsystems .
