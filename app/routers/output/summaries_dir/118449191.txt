a family of high rate quantum error correcting codes adapted to the amplitude damping channel is presented . these codes are nonadditive and exploit self - complementarity structure to correct all first - order errors . their rates can be higher than 1/2 . the recovery operations of these codes can be generated by a simple algorithm and have a projection nature , which makes them potentially easy to implement .
