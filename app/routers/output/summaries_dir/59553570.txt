finding the maximum value of a function in a dynamic model plays an important role in many application settings , including discrete optimization in the presence of hard constraints . we present an iterative quantum algorithm for finding the maximum value of a function in which prior search results update the acceptable response . our approach is based on quantum search and utilizes a dynamic oracle function to mark items in a specified input set . as a realization of function optimization , we verify the correctness of the algorithm using numerical simulations of quantum circuits for the knapsack problem . our simulations make use of an explicit oracle function based on arithmetic operations and a comparator subroutine , and we verify these implementations using numerical simulations up to 30 qubits .
