single - photon entanglement is one of the primary resources for quantum networks , including quantum repeater architectures . such entanglement can be revealed with only local homodyne measurements through the entanglement witness presented in [ morin et al . phys . rev . lett . 110 , 130401 ( 2013 ) ] . here , we provide an extended analysis of this witness by introducing analytical bounds and by reporting measurements confirming its great robustness with regard to losses . this study highlights the potential of optical hybrid methods , where discrete entanglement is characterized through continuous - variable measurements .
