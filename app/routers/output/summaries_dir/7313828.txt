classical and quantum information are very different . together they can perform feats that neither could achieve alone , such as quantum computing , quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation . some of the applications range from helping to preventing spies from reading private communications . among the tools that will facilitate their implementation , we note quantum purification and quantum error correction . although some of these ideas are still beyond the grasp of current technology , quantum cryptography has been implemented and the prospects are encouraging for small - scale prototypes of quantum computation devices before the end of the millennium .
