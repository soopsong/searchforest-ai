we study states of one- and two - dimensional spin systems that are constructed as correlators within the conformal field theory of a massless , free boson . in one dimension , these are good variational wave functions for xxz spin chains and they are similar to lattice laughlin states in two dimensions . we show that their zz correlations are determined by a modification of the original free - boson theory . an expansion to quadratic order leads to a solvable , effective theory for the correlations in these states . compared to the massless boson , there is an additional term in this effective theory that explains the behavior of the correlations : a polynomial decay in one dimension and at the edge of a two - dimensional system and an exponential decay in the bulk of a two - dimensional system . we test the validity of our approximation by comparing it to monte carlo computations .
