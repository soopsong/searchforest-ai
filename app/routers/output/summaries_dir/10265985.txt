we consider the problem of implementing mutually unbiased bases ( mub ) for a polarization qubit with only one wave plate , the minimum number of wave plates . we show that one wave plate is sufficient to realize two mub as long as its phase shift ( modulo $ 360^\circ$ ) ranges between $ 45^\circ$ and $ 315^\circ$. { it can realize } three mub ( a complete set of mub for a qubit ) if the phase shift of the wave plate is within $ [ 111.5^\circ , 141.7^\circ]$ or its symmetric range with respect to 180$^\circ$. the systematic error of the realized mub using a third - wave plate ( twp ) with $ 120^\circ$ phase is calculated to be a half of that using the combination of a quarter - wave plate ( qwp ) and a half - wave plate ( hwp ) . as experimental applications , twps are used in single - qubit and two - qubit quantum state tomography experiments and the results show a systematic error reduction by $ 50\%$. this technique not only saves one wave plate but also reduces the systematic error , which can be applied to quantum state tomography and other applications involving mub . the proposed twp may become a useful instrument in optical experiments , replacing multiple elements like qwp and hwp .
