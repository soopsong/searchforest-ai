we model repetitive quantum error correction ( qec ) with the single - error - correcting five - qubit code on a network of individually - controlled qubits with always - on ising couplings , using our previously designed universal set of quantum gates based on sequences of shaped decoupling pulses . in addition to serving as accurate quantum gates , the sequences also provide dynamical decoupling ( dd ) of low - frequency phase noise . the simulation involves integrating unitary dynamics of six qubits over the duration of tens of thousands of control pulses , using classical stochastic phase noise as a source of decoherence . the combined dd / qec protocol dramatically improves the coherence , with the qec alone responsible for more than an order of magnitude infidelity reduction .
