recent experimental progress in quantum information processing with trapped ions have demonstrated most of the fundamental elements required to realize a scalable quantum computer . the next set of challenges lie in realization of a large number of qubits and the means to prepare , manipulate and measure them , leading to error - protected qubits and fault tolerant architectures . the integration of qubits necessarily require integrated optical approach as most of these operations involve interaction with photons . in this paper , we discuss integrated optics technologies and concrete optical designs needed for the physical realization of scalable quantum computer .
