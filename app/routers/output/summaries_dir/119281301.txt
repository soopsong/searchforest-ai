this paper proposes a new robust control method for quantum systems with uncertainties involving sliding mode control ( smc ) . sliding mode control is a widely used approach in classical control theory and industrial applications . we show that smc is also a useful method for robust control of quantum systems . in this paper , we define two specific classes of sliding modes ( i.e. , eigenstates and state subspaces ) and propose two novel methods combining unitary control and periodic projective measurements for the design of quantum sliding mode control systems . two examples including a two - level system and a three - level system are presented to demonstrate the proposed smc method . one of main features of the proposed method is that the designed control laws can guarantee desired control performance in the presence of uncertainties in the system hamiltonian . this sliding mode control approach provides a useful control theoretic tool for robust quantum information processing with uncertainties .
