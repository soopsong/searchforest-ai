the partner mode with respect to a vacuum state for a given mode ( like that corresponding to one of the thermal particles emitted by a black hole ) is defined and calculated . the partner modes are explicitly calculated for a number of cases , in particular for the modes corresponding to a particle detector being excited by turn - on / turn - off transients , or with the thermal particles emitted by the accelerated mirror model for black hole evaporation . one of the key results is that the partner mode in general is just a vacuum fluctuation , and one can have the partner mode be located in a region where the state can not be distinguished from the vacuum state by any series of local measurements , including the energy density . i.e . ,"information"(the correlations with the thermal emissions ) need not be associated with any energy transport . the idea that black holes emit huge amounts of energy in their last stages because of all the information which must be emitted under the assumption of black - hole unitarity is found not necessarily to be the case .
