we present ultrafast all - optical switching measurements of si woodpile photonic band gap crystals . the crystals are spatially homogeneously excited , and probed by measuring reflectivity over an octave in frequency ( including the telecom range ) as a function of time . after 300 fs , the complete stop band has shifted to higher frequencies as a result of optically excited free carriers . the switched state relaxes quickly with a time constant of 18 ps . we present a quantitative analysis of switched spectra with theory for finite photonic crystals . the induced changes in refractive index are well described by a drude model with a carrier relaxation time of 10 fs . we briefly discuss possible applications of high - repetition rate switching of photonic crystal cavities .
