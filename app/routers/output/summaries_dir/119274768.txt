we derive the filtering equation for markovian systems undergoing homodyne measurement in the situation where the output processes being monitored are squeezed . the filtering theory applies to case where the system is driven by fock noise ( that , quantum input processes in a coherent state ) and where the output is mixed with a squeezed signal . it also applies to the case of a system driven by squeezed noise , but here there is a physical restriction to emission / absorption coupling only . for the special case of a cavity mode where the dynamics is linear , we are able to derive explicitly the filtered estimate $ \pi_t ( a)$ for the mode annihilator $ a$ based on the homodyne quadrature observations up to time $ t$.
