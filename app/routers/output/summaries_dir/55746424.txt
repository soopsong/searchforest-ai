we study the interplay of disorder with pumping and decay in coupled qubit - cavity arrays , the jaynes - cummings - hubbard model . we find that relatively weak disorder can wash out the bistability present in the clean pumped system , and that moreover , the combination of disorder in on - site energies and decay can lead to effective phase disorder . to explore these questions , we present a non- equilibrium generalisation of stochastic - mean - field theory , providing a simple tool to address such questions . this technique is developed for rather general forms of light - matter coupling , driving , dissipation , and on - site disorder , making it applicable to a wide range of systems .
