we consider thermodynamic systems with finitely many degrees of freedom and subject to an external control action . we derive some basic results on the dependence of the relative entropy production rate on the controlling force . applications to macromolecular cooling and to controlling the convergence to equilibrium rate are sketched . analogous results are derived for closed and open n - level quantum systems .
