we study numerically the dynamics of the rabi hamiltonian , describing the interaction of a single cavity mode and a two - level atom without the rotating wave approximation , subjected to damping and dephasing reservoirs included via usual lindblad superoperators in the master equation . we show that the combination of the antirotating term and the atomic dephasing leads to linear asymptotic photons generation from vacuum . we reveal the origins of the phenomenon and estimate its importance in realistic situations .
