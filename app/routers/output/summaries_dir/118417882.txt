we explore a version of black hole complementarity , where an approximate semiclassical effective field theory for interior infalling degrees of freedom emerges holographically from an exact evolution of exterior degrees of freedom . the infalling degrees of freedom have a complementary description in terms of outgoing hawking radiation and must eventually decohere with respect to the exterior hamiltonian , leading to a breakdown of the semiclassical description for an infaller . trace distance is used to quantify the difference between the complementary time evolutions , and to define a decoherence time . we propose a dictionary where the evolution with respect to the bulk effective hamiltonian corresponds to mean field evolution in the holographic theory . in a particular model for the holographic theory , which exhibits fast scrambling , the decoherence time coincides with the scrambling time . the results support the hypothesis that decoherence of the infalling holographic state and disruptive bulk effects near the curvature singularity are complementary descriptions of the same physics , which is an important step toward resolving the black hole information paradox .
