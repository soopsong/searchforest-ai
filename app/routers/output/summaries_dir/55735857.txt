we demonstrate a method for general linear optical networks that allows one to factorize any su($n$ ) matrix in terms of two su($n-1)$ blocks coupled by an su(2 ) entangling beam splitter . the process can be recursively continued in an efficient way , ending in a tidy arrangement of su(2 ) transformations . the method hinges only on a linear relationship between input and output states , and can thus be applied to a variety of scenarios , such as microwaves , acoustics , and quantum fields .
