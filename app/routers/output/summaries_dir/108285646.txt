we investigate the creation of squeezed states of a vibrating membrane or a movable mirror in an opto - mechanical system . an optical cavity is driven by squeezed light and couples via radiation pressure to the membrane / mirror , effectively providing a squeezed heat - bath for the mechanical oscillator . under the conditions of laser cooling to the ground state , we find an efficient transfer of squeezing with roughly 60 % of light squeezing conveyed to the membrane / mirror ( on a db scale ) . we determine the requirements on the carrier frequency and the bandwidth of squeezed light . beyond the conditions of ground state cooling , we predict mechanical squashing to be observable in current systems .
