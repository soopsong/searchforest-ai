we describe the results of a parametric down - conversion experiment in which the detection of one photon of a pair causes the other photon to be switched into a storage loop . the stored photon can then be switched out of the loop at a later time chosen by the user , providing a single photon for potential use in a variety of quantum information processing applications . although the stored single photon is only available at periodic time intervals , those times can be chosen to match the cycle time of a quantum computer by using pulsed down - conversion . the potential use of the storage loop as a photonic quantum memory device is also discussed .
