we consider some consequences of describing the gauge and matter degrees of freedom in our universe by open strings , as suggested by the braneworld scenario . we focus on the geometric effects described by the open string metric and investigate their observational implications . the causal structure of spacetime on the brane is altered ; it is described not by the usual metric $ g_{\mu\nu}$ , but instead by the open string metric , that incorporates the electromagnetic background , $ g_{\mu\nu } = g_{\mu\nu } - ( 2\pi \alpha^\prime)^2 ( f^2)_{\mu\nu}$. the speed of light is now slower when propagating along directions transverse to electromagnetic fields or an ns - ns two form , so that lorentz invariance is explicitly broken . a generalized equivalence principle guarantees that the propagation of { \it all } particles , not just photons , ( with the exception of gravitons ) is slower in these transverse directions . we describe a variety of astrophysical and laboratory - based experiments designed to detect the predicted variations in the causal structure . we show that current technology can not probe beyond open string lengths of $ 10^{-13}$ cm , corresponding to mev string scales . we also point out that in a braneworld scenario , constraints on large scale electromagnetic fields together with a modest phenomenological bound on the ns - ns two - form naturally lead to a bound on the scale of canonical noncommutativity that is two orders of magnitude below the string length . by invoking theoretical constraints on the ns - ns two - form this bound can be improved to give an extremely strong bound on the noncommutative scale well below the planck length , $ \sqrt{|\theta|_{max}}<10^{-35 } { \rm cm } \times ( { { \rm tev } \over { \rm string } { \rm scale } }
