we apply collective raman scattering to create , store and retrieve spatially multimode light in warm rubidium-87 vapors . the light is created in a spontaneous stokes scattering process . this is accompanied by the creation of counterpart collective excitations in the atomic ensemble -- the spin waves . after a certain storage time we coherently convert the spin waves into the light in deterministic anti - stokes scattering . the whole process can be regarded as a delayed four - wave mixing which produces pairs of correlated , delayed random images . storage of higher order spatial modes up to microseconds is possible owing to usage of a buffer gas . we study the performance of the raman scattering , storage and retrieval of collective excitations focusing on spatial effects and the influence of decoherence caused by diffusion of rubidium atoms in different buffer gases . we quantify the number of modes created and retrieved by analyzing statistical correlations of intensity fluctuations between portions of the light scattered in the far field .
