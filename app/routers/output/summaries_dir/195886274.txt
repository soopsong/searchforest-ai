we consider a qubit coupled to another system ( its environment ) , and discuss the relationship between the effects of subjecting the qubit to either a dynamical decoupling sequence of unitary operations , or a sequence of projective measurements . we give a formal statement concerning equivalence of a sequence of coherent operations on a qubit , precisely operations from a minimal set $ \left\{1_q,\hat{\sigma}_x\right\}$ , and a sequence of projective measurements of $ \hat{\sigma}_x$ observable . using it we show that when a qubit is subjected to $ n$ such successive projective measurements at certain times , the expectation value of the last measurement can be expressed as a linear combination of expectation values of $ \hat{\sigma}_x$ observed after subjecting the qubit to dynamical decoupling sequences of $ \pi$ pulses , with $ k\leq n$ of them applied at subsets of these times . performing a sequence of measurements on the qubit gives then the same information about qubit decoherence and dynamics of environment as that contained in dynamical decoupling signal . analyzing the latter has been widely used to gain information about the environmental dynamics ( perform so - called noise spectroscopy ) , so our result shows how all the data obtained for dynamical decoupling based protocols is related to those that can be obtained just by performing multiple measurements on the qubit . we also discuss in more detail the application of the general result to the case of the qubit undergoing pure dephasing , and outline possible extensions to higher - dimensional ( a qudit or multiple qubits ) systems .
