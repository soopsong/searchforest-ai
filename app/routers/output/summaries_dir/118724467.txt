based on the framework of consistent history theory , the quantum entangled history was proposed in 2015 and experimentally verified through temporal greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) test with $ 3 $ time nodes in 2016 . in this paper , we extend the temporal ghz test to arbitrary time nodes and even system dimensions . then , we define a witness to distinguish between the quantum entangled histories and the classical histories . the minimums of the witness for the classical histories are calculated for arbitrary number of time nodes and the system dimensions $ 2 $ and $ \infty$. it is found that the minimums of the witness for the classical histories is always larger than the quantum entangled histories minimum $ -1$. only when both the number of time nodes and system dimensions approach to infinity , the minimum of the witness for classical and quantum entangled histories are identical .
