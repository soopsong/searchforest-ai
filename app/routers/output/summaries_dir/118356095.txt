we propose an entanglement distillation and purification scheme for symmetric two - mode entangled gaussian states that allows to asymptotically extract a pure entangled gaussian state from any input entangled symmetric gaussian state . the proposed scheme is a modified and extended version of the entanglement distillation protocol originally developed by [ browne et al . , phys . rev . a 67 , 062320 ( 2003 ) ] . a key feature of the present protocol is that it utilizes a two - copy de - gaussification procedure that involves a mach - zehnder interferometer with single - mode non - gaussian filters inserted in its two arms . the required non - gaussian filtering operations can be implemented by coherently combining two sequences of single - photon addition and subtraction operations .
