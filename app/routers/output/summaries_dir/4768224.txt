deterministic techniques enabling the implementation and engineering of bright and coherent solid - state quantum light sources are key for the reliable realization of a next generation of quantum devices . such a technology , at best , should allow one to significantly scale up the number of implemented devices within a given processing time . in this work , we discuss a possible technology platform for such a scaling procedure , relying on the application of nanoscale quantum dot imaging to the pillar microcavity architecture , which promises to combine very high photon extraction efficiency and indistinguishability . we discuss the alignment technology in detail , and present the optical characterization of a selected device which features a strongly purcell - enhanced emission output . this device , which yields an extraction efficiency of $ \eta=(49\pm4)~\%$ , facilitates the emission of photons with $ ( 94\pm2.7)~\%$ indistinguishability .
