we consider entanglement detection for quantum key distribution systems that use two signal states and continuous variable measurements . this problem can be formulated as a separability problem in a qubit - mode system . to verify entanglement , we introduce an object that combines the covariance matrix of the mode with the density matrix of the qubit . we derive necessary separability criteria for this scenario . these criteria can be readily evaluated using semidefinite programming and we apply them to the specific quantum key distribution protocol .
