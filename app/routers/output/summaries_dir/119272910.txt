we investigate the spontaneous emission of a two - level system , e.g. an atom or atomlike object , coupled to a single - end , i.e. , semi - infinite , one - dimensional photonic waveguide such that one end behaves as a perfect mirror while light can pass through the opposite end with no back - reflection . through a quantum microscopic model we show that such geometry can cause non - exponential and long - lived atomic decay . under suitable conditions , a bound atom - photon stationary state appears in the atom - mirror interspace so as to trap a considerable amount of initial atomic excitation . yet , this can be released by applying an atomic frequency shift causing a revival of photon emission . the resilience of such effects to typical detrimental factors is analyzed .
