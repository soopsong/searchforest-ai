recent improvements in control of quantum systems make it seem feasible to finally build a quantum computer within a decade . while it has been shown that such a quantum computer can in principle solve certain small electronic structure problems and idealized model hamiltonians , the highly relevant problem of directly solving a complex correlated material appears to require a prohibitive amount of resources . here , we show that by using a hybrid quantum - classical algorithm that incorporates the power of a small quantum computer into a framework of classical embedding algorithms , the electronic structure of complex correlated materials can be efficiently tackled using a quantum computer . in our approach , the quantum computer solves a small effective quantum impurity problem that is self - consistently determined via a feedback loop between the quantum and classical computation . use of a quantum computer enables much larger and more accurate simulations than with any known classical algorithm , and will allow many open questions in quantum materials to be resolved once a small quantum computer with around one hundred logical qubits becomes available .
