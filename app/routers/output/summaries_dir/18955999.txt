we show that quantum coherence of biomolecular excitons is maintained over exceedingly long times due to the constructive role of their non - markovian protein - solvent environment . using a numerically exact approach , we demonstrate that a slow quantum bath helps to sustain quantum entanglement of two pairs of forster coupled excitons , in contrast to a markovian environment . we consider the crossover from a fast to a slow bath and from weak to strong dissipation and show that a slow bath can generate robust entanglement . this persists to surprisingly high temperatures , even higher than the excitonic gap and is absent for a markovian bath .
