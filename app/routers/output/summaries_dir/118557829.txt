the realisation of large - scale quantum computing is no longer simply a hardware question . the rapid development of quantum technology has resulted in dozens of control and programming problems that should be directed towards the classical computer science and engineering community . one such problem is known as pauli tracking . methods for implementing quantum algorithms that are compatible with crucial error correction technology utilise extensive quantum teleportation protocols . these protocols are intrinsically probabilistic and result in correction operators that occur as byproducts of teleportation . these byproduct operators do not need to be corrected in the quantum hardware itself . instead , byproduct operators are tracked through the circuit and output results reinterpreted . this tracking is routinely ignored in quantum information as it is assumed that tracking algorithms will eventually be developed . in this work we help fill this gap and present an algorithm for tracking byproduct operators through a quantum computation . we formulate this work based on quantum gate sets that are compatible with all major forms of quantum error correction and demonstrate the completeness of the algorithm .
