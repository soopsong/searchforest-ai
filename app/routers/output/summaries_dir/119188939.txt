since the very first experiments , superconducting circuits have suffered from strong coupling to environmental noise , destroying quantum coherence and degrading performance . in state - of - the - art experiments , it is found that the relaxation time of superconducting qubits fluctuates as a function of time . we present measurements of such fluctuations in a 3d - transmon circuit and develop a qualitative model based on interactions within a bath of background two - level systems ( tls ) which emerge from defects in the device material . in our model , the time - dependent noise density acting on the qubit emerges from its near - resonant coupling to high - frequency tls which experience energy fluctuations due to their interaction with thermally fluctuating tls at low frequencies . we support the model by providing experimental evidence of such energy fluctuations observed in a single tls in a phase qubit circuit .
