we propose methods for the preparation and entanglement detection of multi - qubit ghz states in circuit quantum electrodynamics . using quantum trajectory simulations appropriate for the situation of a weak continuous measurement , we show that the joint dispersive readout of several qubits can be utilized for the probabilistic production of high - fidelity ghz states . when employing a nonlinear filter on the recorded homodyne signal , the selected states are found to exhibit values of the bell - mermin operator exceeding 2 under realistic conditions . we discuss the potential of the dispersive readout to demonstrate a violation of the mermin bound , and present a measurement scheme avoiding the necessity for full detector tomography .
