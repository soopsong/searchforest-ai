imperfect devices in commercial quantum key distribution systems open security loopholes that an eavesdropper may exploit . an example of one such imperfection is the wavelength dependent coupling ratio of the fiber beam splitter . utilizing this loophole , the eavesdropper can vary the transmittances of the fiber beam splitter at the receiver 's side by inserting lights with wavelengths different from what is normally used . here , we propose a wavelength attack on a practical continuous - variable quantum key distribution system using homodyne detection . by inserting light pulses at different wavelengths , this attack allows the eavesdropper to bias the shot noise estimation even if it is done in real time . based on experimental data , we discuss the feasibility of this attack and suggest a prevention scheme by improving the previously proposed countermeasures .
