we propose how to generate macroscopic quantum superposition states using a microwave cavity containing a superconducting charge qubit . based on the measurement of charge states , we show that the superpositions of two macroscopically distinguishable coherent states of a single - mode cavity field can be generated by a controllable interaction between a cavity field and a charge qubit . after such superpositions of the cavity field are created , the interaction can be switched off by the classical magnetic field , and there is no information transfer between the cavity field and the charge qubit . we also discuss the generation of the superpositions of two squeezed coherent states .
