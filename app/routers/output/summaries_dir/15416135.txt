we present an efficient addition circuit , borrowing techniques from the classical carry - lookahead arithmetic circuit . our quantum carry - lookahead ( qcla ) adder accepts two n - bit numbers and adds them in o(log n ) depth using o(n ) ancillary qubits . we present both in - place and out - of - place versions , as well as versions that add modulo 2^n and modulo 2^n - 1 . previously , the linear - depth ripple - carry addition circuit has been the method of choice . our work reduces the cost of addition dramatically with only a slight increase in the number of required qubits . the qcla adder can be used within current modular multiplication circuits to reduce substantially the run - time of shor 's algorithm .
