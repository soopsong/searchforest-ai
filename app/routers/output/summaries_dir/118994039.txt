we address continuous - time quantum walks on graphs , and discuss whether and how quantum - limited measurements on the walker may extract information on the tunnelling amplitude between the nodes of the graphs . for a few remarkable families of graphs , we evaluate the ultimate quantum bound to precision , i.e. we compute the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) , and assess the performances of incomplete measurements , i.e. measurements performed on a subset of the graph 's nodes . we also optimize the qfi over the initial preparation of the walker and find the optimal measurement achieving the ultimate precision in each case . as the topology of the graph is changed , a non - trivial interplay between the connectivity and the achievable precision is uncovered .
