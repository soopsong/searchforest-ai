quantum memories are an integral component of quantum repeaters - devices that will allow the extension of quantum key distribution to communication ranges beyond that permissible by passive transmission . a quantum memory for this application needs to be highly efficient and have coherence times approaching a millisecond . here we report on work towards this goal , with the development of a $ ^{87}$rb magneto - optical trap with a peak optical depth of 1000 for the d2 $ f=2 \rightarrow f'=3 $ transition using spatial and temporal dark spots . with this purpose - built cold atomic ensemble to implement the gradient echo memory ( gem ) scheme . our data shows a memory efficiency of $ 80\pm 2$% and coherence times up to 195 $ \mu$s , which is a factor of four greater than previous gem experiments implemented in warm vapour cells .
