we present experimental results which demonstrate that nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is capable of efficiently emulating many of the capabilities of quantum computers , including unitary evolution and coherent superpositions , but without attendant wave - function collapse . specifically , we have : ( 1 ) implemented the quantum xor gate in two different ways , one using pound - overhauser double resonance , and the other using a spin - coherence double resonance pulse sequence ; ( 2 ) demonstrated that the square root of the pound - overhauser xor corresponds to a conditional rotation , thus obtaining a universal set of gates ; ( 3 ) devised a spin - coherence implementation of the toffoli gate , and confirmed that it transforms the equilibrium state of a four - spin system as expected ; ( 4 ) used standard gradient - pulse techniques in nmr to equalize all but one of the populations in a two - spin system , so obtaining the pseudo - pure state that corresponds to |00 > ; ( 5 ) validated that one can identify which basic pseudo - pure state is present by transforming it into one - spin superpositions , whose associated spectra jointly characterize the state ; ( 6 ) applied the spin - coherence xor gate to a one - spin superposition to create an entangled state , and confirmed its existence by detecting the associated double - quantum coherence via gradient - echo methods .
