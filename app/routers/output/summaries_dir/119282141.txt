we revisit the notion of nonclassical distance of states of bosonic quantum systems introduced in [ m. hillery , phys . rev . a 35 , 725 ( 1987 ) ] in a general multimode setting . after reviewing its definition , we establish some of its general properties . we obtain new upper and lower bounds on the nonclassical distance in terms of the supremum of the husimi function of the state . considering several examples , we elucidate the cases for which our lower bound is tight , which include the multimode number states and a class of multimode n00n states . the latter provide examples of states of definite photon number $ n \geq 2 $ whose nonclassical distance can be made arbitrarily close to the upper limit of $ 1 $ by increasing the number of modes . we show that the nonclassical distance of the even and odd schr\"odinger cat states is bounded away from unity regardless of how macroscopic the superpositions are , and that the nonclassical distance is not necessarily monotonically increasing with respect to macroscopicity .
