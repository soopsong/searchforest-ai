closed - system quantum annealing is expected to sometimes fail spectacularly in solving simple problems for which the gap becomes exponentially small in the problem size . much less is known about whether this gap scaling also impedes open - system quantum annealing . here we study the performance of a quantum annealing processor in solving such a problem : a ferromagnetic chain with sectors of alternating coupling strength that is classically trivial but exhibits an exponentially decreasing gap in the sector size . the gap is several orders of magnitude smaller than the device temperature . contrary to the closed - system expectation , the success probability rises for sufficiently large sector sizes . the success probability is strongly correlated with the number of thermally accessible excited states at the critical point . we demonstrate that this behavior is consistent with a quantum open - system description that is unrelated to thermal relaxation , and is instead dominated by the system 's properties at the critical point .
