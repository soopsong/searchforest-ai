measurement - based quantum computation offers exponential computational speed - up via simple measurements on a large entangled cluster state . we propose and demonstrate a scalable scheme for the generation of photonic cluster states suitable for universal measurement - based quantum computation . we exploit temporal multiplexing of squeezed light modes , delay loops , and beam - splitter transformations to deterministically generate a cylindrical cluster state with a two - dimensional ( 2d ) topological structure as required for universal quantum information processing . the generated state consists of more than 30000 entangled modes arranged in a cylindrical lattice with 24 modes on the circumference , defining the input register , and a length of 1250 modes , defining the computation depth . our demonstrated source of 2d cluster states can be combined with quantum error correction based on the gottesman - kitaev - preskill qubit encoding to enable fault - tolerant quantum computation .
