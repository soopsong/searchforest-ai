propagating quantum microwaves have been proposed and successfully implemented to generate entanglement , thereby establishing a promising platform for the realisation of a quantum communication channel . however , the implementation of quantum teleportation with photons in the microwave regime is still absent . at the same time , recent developments in the field show that this key protocol could be feasible with current technology , which would pave the way to boost the field of microwave quantum communication . here , we discuss the feasibility of a possible implementation of microwave quantum teleportation in a realistic scenario with losses . furthermore , we propose how to implement quantum repeaters in the microwave regime without using photodetection , a key prerequisite to achieve long distance entanglement distribution .
