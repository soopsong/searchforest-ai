we analytically study a system of spinless fermions driven at the boundary with an oscillating chemical potential . various transport regimes can be observed : at zero driving frequency the particle current through the system is independent of the system 's length ; at the phase - transition frequency , being equal to the bandwidth , the current decays as n^{-alpha } with the chain length n , alpha being either 2 or 3 ; below the transition the scaling of the current is n^{-1/2 } , indicating anomalous transport , while it is exponentially small exp{(-n/2xi ) } above the transition . therefore , by a simple change of frequency of the a.c . driving one can vary transport from ballistic , anomalous , to insulating .
