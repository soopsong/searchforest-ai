a new type of complex hadamard matrices of order 9 are constructed . the studied matrices are symmetric , block circulant with circulant blocks ( $ bccb$ ) and form an until now unknown non - reducible and non - affine two - parameter orbit . several suborbits are identified , including a one - parameter intersection with the fourier orbit $ f_{9}^{(4)}$. the defect of this new type of hadamard matrices is observed to vary , from a generic value 2 to the anomalous values 4 and 10 for some sub - orbits , and to 12 and 16 for some single matrices . the latter matrices are shown to be related to complete sets of mubs in dimension 9 .
