in this paper , we study the quantum self - contained refrigerator [ linden et al . , phys . rev . lett . 105 , 130401 ( 2010)prltao0031 - 900710.1103 / physrevlett.105.130401 ] in the strong internal coupling regime with engineered reservoirs . we find that if some modes of the three thermal reservoirs can be properly filtered out , the efficiency and the working domain of the refrigerator can be improved in contrast to the those in the weak internal coupling regime , which indicates one advantage of the strong internal coupling . in addition , we find that the background natural vacuum reservoir could cause the filtered refrigerator to stop working and the background natural thermal reservoir could greatly reduce the cooling efficiency .
