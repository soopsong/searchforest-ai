we present networks for directly estimating the polynomial invariants of multi - party quantum states under local transformations . the structure of these networks is closely related to the structure of the invariants themselves and this lends a physical interpretation to these otherwise abstract mathematical quantities . specifically , our networks estimate the invariants under local unitary ( lu ) transformations and under stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) . our networks can estimate the lu invariants for multi - party states , where each party can have a hilbert space of arbitrary dimension and the slocc invariants for multi - qubit states . we analyze the statistical efficiency of our networks compared to methods based on estimating the state coefficients and calculating the invariants .
