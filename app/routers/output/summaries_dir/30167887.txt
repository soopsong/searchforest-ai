we report on ultrastrong coupling between a superconducting flux qubit and a resonant mode of a system comprised of two superconducting coplanar stripline resonators coupled galvanically to the qubit . with a coupling strength as high as 17 % of the mode frequency , exceeding that of previous circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments , we observe a pronounced bloch - siegert shift . the spectroscopic response of our multimode system reveals a clear breakdown of the jaynes - cummings model . in contrast to earlier experiments , the high coupling strength is achieved without making use of an additional inductance provided by a josephson junction .
