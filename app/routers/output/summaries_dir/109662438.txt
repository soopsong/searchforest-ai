all - linear - optical scheme for fully featured quantum router is presented . this device directs the signal photonic qubit according to the state of one control photonic qubit . in the introduction we formulate the list of requirements imposed on a fully quantum router . then we describe our proposal showing the exact principle of operation on a linear - optical scheme . subsequently we provide generalization of the scheme in order to optimize the success probability by means of a tunable controlled - phase gate . at the end , we show how one can modify the device to route multiple signal qubits using the same control qubit .
