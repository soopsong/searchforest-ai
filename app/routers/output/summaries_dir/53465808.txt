we investigate schemes for hamiltonian parameter estimation of a two - level system using repeated measurements in a fixed basis . the simplest ( fourier based ) schemes yield an estimate with a mean square error ( mse ) that decreases at best as a power law ~n^{-2 } in the number of measurements n. by contrast , we present numerical simulations indicating that an adaptive bayesian algorithm , where the time between measurements can be adjusted based on prior measurement results , yields a mse which appears to scale close to \exp(-0.3 n ) . that is , measurements in a single fixed basis are sufficient to achieve exponential scaling in n.
