we study the coexistence of the quantum zeno effect and non - markovianity for a system decaying in a structured bosonic environment and subject to a control field . the interaction with the environment induces decay from the excited to the ground level , which , in turn , is coherently coupled to another meta - stable state . the control of the strength of the coherent coupling between the stable levels allows the engineering of both the dissipation and of the memory effects , without modifying neither the system - reservoir interaction , nor environmental properties . we use this framework in two different parameter regimes corresponding to fast ( bad cavity limit ) and slow dissipation ( good cavity limit ) in the original , un - controlled qubit system . our results show a non - monotonic behavior of memory effects when increasing the effectiveness of the zeno - like freezing . moreover , we identify a new source of memory effects which allows the persistence of non - markovianity for long times while the excited state has already been depleted .
