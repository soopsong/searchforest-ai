we investigate theoretically quantum effects of a cavity - atom system in which the upper two levels of a cascade - type three - level atom interact with a cavity field mode in the ultrastrong coupling regime . by exploiting the virtual photons carried by atom - cavity dressed states , we indicate how two external driving fields induce raman transitions such that a continuous conversion of virtual photons into real photons can be achieved with a high probability . we present analytical and numerical solutions of the system . in addition , we show that the converted photons exhibit a bunching behavior in the steady state . our scheme demonstrates that atom - cavity dressed states in the ultrastrong coupling regime can serve as intermediate states to invoke nonlinear optical processes .
