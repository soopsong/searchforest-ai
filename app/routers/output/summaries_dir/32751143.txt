we introduce a new direction in the field of atom optics , atom interferometry , and neutral - atom quantum information processing . it is based on the use of microfabricated optical elements . with these elements versatile and integrated atom optical devices can be created in a compact fashion . this approach opens the possibility to scale , parallelize , and miniaturize atom optics for new investigations in fundamental research and application . it will lead to new , compact sources of ultracold atoms , compact sensors based on matter wave interference and new approaches towards quantum computing with neutral atoms . the exploitation of the unique features of the quantum mechanical behavior of matter waves and the capabilities of powerful state - of - the - art micro- and nanofabrication techniques lend this approach a special attraction .
