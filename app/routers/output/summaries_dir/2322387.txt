in this paper , simultaneous reduction of circuit depth and synthesis cost of reversible circuits in quantum technologies with limited interaction is addressed . we developed a cycle - based synthesis algorithm which uses negative controls and limited distance between gate lines . to improve circuit depth , a new parallel structure is introduced in which before synthesis a set of disjoint cycles are extracted from the input specification and distributed into some subsets . the cycles of each subset are synthesized independently on different sets of ancillae . accordingly , each disjoint set can be synthesized by different synthesis methods . our analysis shows that the best worst - case synthesis cost of reversible circuits in the linear nearest neighbor architecture is improved by the proposed approach . our experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed approach to reduce cost and circuit depth for several benchmarks .
