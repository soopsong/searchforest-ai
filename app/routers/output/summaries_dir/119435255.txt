a parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) source can be used as either a triggered single photon source or an entangled photon source in quantum key distribution ( qkd ) . the triggering pdc qkd has already been studied in the literature . on the other hand , a model and a post - processing protocol for the entanglement pdc qkd are still missing . in this paper , we fill in this important gap by proposing such a model and a post - processing protocol for the entanglement pdc qkd . although the pdc model is proposed to study the entanglement - based qkd , we emphasize that our generic model may also be useful for other non - qkd experiments involving a pdc source . since an entangled pdc source is a basis independent source , we apply koashi - preskill 's security analysis to the entanglement pdc qkd . we also investigate the entanglement pdc qkd with two - way classical communications . we find that the recurrence scheme increases the key rate and gottesman - lo protocol helps tolerate higher channel losses . by simulating a recent 144 km open - air pdc experiment , we compare three implementations -- entanglement pdc qkd , triggering pdc qkd and coherent state qkd . the simulation result suggests that the entanglement pdc qkd can tolerate higher channel losses than the coherent state qkd . the coherent state qkd with decoy states is able to achieve highest key rate in the low and medium - loss regions . by applying gottesman - lo two - way post - processing protocol , the entanglement pdc qkd can tolerate up to 70db combined channel losses ( 35db for each channel ) provided that the pdc source is placed in between alice and bob . after considering statistical fluctuations , the pdc setup can tolerate up to 53db channel losses .
