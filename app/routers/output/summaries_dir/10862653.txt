quantum - enhanced metrology can be achieved by entangling a probe with an auxiliary system , passing the probe through an interferometer , and subsequently making measurements on both the probe and auxiliary system . conceptually , this corresponds to performing metrology with the purification of a ( mixed ) probe state . we demonstrate via the quantum fisher information how to design mixed states whose purifications are an excellent metrological resource . in particular , we give examples of mixed states with purifications that allow ( near ) heisenberg - limited metrology , and provide example entangling hamiltonians that can generate these states . finally , we present the optimal measurement and parameter - estimation procedure required to realize these sensitivities ( i.e. that saturate the quantum cram\'er - rao bound ) . since pure states of comparable metrological usefulness are typically challenging to generate , it may prove easier to use this approach of entanglement and measurement of an auxiliary system . an example where this may be the case is atom interferometry , where entanglement with optical systems is potentially easier to engineer than the atomic interactions required to produce nonclassical atomic states .
