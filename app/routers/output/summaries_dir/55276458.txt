nonlocality of two - mode states of light is addressed by means of chsh inequality based on displaced on / off photodetection . effects due to non - unit quantum efficiency and nonzero dark counts are taken into account . nonlocality of both balanced and unbalanced superpositions of few photon - number states , as well as that of multiphoton twin beams , is investigated . we find that unbalanced superpositions show larger nonlocality than balanced one when noise affects the photodetection process . de - gaussification by means of ( inconclusive ) photon subtraction is shown to enhance nonlocality of twin beams in the low energy regime . we also show that when the measurement is described by a povm , rather than a set of projectors , the maximum achievable value of the bell parameter in the chsh inequality is decreased , and is no longer given by the cirel'son bound .
