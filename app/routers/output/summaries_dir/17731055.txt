we report on the generation of indistinguishable photon pairs at telecom wavelengths based on a type - ii parametric down conversion process in a periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ppktp ) crystal . the phase matching , pump laser characteristics and coupling geometry are optimised to obtain spectrally uncorrelated photons with high coupling efficiencies . four photons are generated by a counter- propagating pump in the same crystal and anlysed via two photon interference experiments between photons from each pair source as well as joint spectral and g^(2 ) measurements . we obtain a spectral purity of 0.91 and coupling efficiencies around 90 % for all four photons without any filtering . these pure indistinguishable photon sources at telecom wavelengths are perfectly adapted for quantum network demonstrations and other multi - photon protocols .
