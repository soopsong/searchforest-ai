we develop a model which can be used to analyse the scenario of exploring quantum network with a distracted sense of direction . using this model we analyse the behaviour of quantum mobile agents operating with non - adaptive and adaptive strategies which can be employed in this scenario . we introduce the notion of node visiting suitable for analysing quantum superpositions of states by distinguishing between visiting and attaining a position . we show that without a proper model of adaptiveness , it is not possible for the party representing the distraction in the sense of direction , to obtain the results analogous to the classical case . moreover , with additional control resources the total number of attained positions is maintained if the number of visited positions is strictly limited .
