we investigate the performance of m - th order consensus systems with stochastic external perturbations , where a subset of leader nodes incorporates absolute information into their control laws . the system performance is measured by its coherence , an $ h_2 $ norm that quantifies the total steady - state variance of the deviation from the desired trajectory . we first give conditions under which such systems are stable , and we derive expressions for coherence in stable second , third , and fourth order systems . we next study the problem of how to identify a set of leaders that optimizes coherence . to address this problem , we define set functions that quantify each system 's coherence and prove that these functions are submodular . this allows the use of an efficient greedy algorithm that to find a leader set with which coherence is within a constant bound of optimal . we demonstrate the performance of the greedy algorithm empirically , and further , we show that the optimal leader sets for the different orders of consensus dynamics do not necessarily coincide .
