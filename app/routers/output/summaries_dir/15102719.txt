bellqma protocols are a subclass of multi - prover quantum merlin - arthur protocols in which the verifier is restricted to perform nonadaptive , unentangled measurements on the quantum states received from each merlin . in this paper , we prove that m - clause 3-sat instances have bellqma proofs of satisfiability with constant soundness gap , in which o(sqrt(m)polylog(m ) ) merlins each send o(log m ) qubits to arthur . our result answers a question of aaronson et al . , who gave a protocol with similar parameters that used entangled measurements ; the analysis of our protocol is significantly simpler than that of aaronson et al . our result also complements recent work of brandao , christandl , and yard , who showed upper bounds on the power of multiprover quantum proofs with unentangled but adaptive ( locc ) measurements .
