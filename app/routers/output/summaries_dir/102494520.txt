we consider a quantum system continuously monitored in time which in turn is coupled to an arbitrary dissipative classical system ( diagonal reduced density matrix ) . the quantum and classical dynamics can modify each other , being described by an arbitrary time - irreversible hybrid lindblad equation . given a measurement trajectory , a conditional bipartite stochastic state can be inferred by taking into account all previous recording information ( filtering ) . here , we demonstrate that the joint quantum - classical state can also be inferred by taking into account both past and future measurement results ( smoothing ) . the smoothed hybrid state is estimated without involving information from unobserved measurement channels . its average over recording realizations recovers the joint time - irreversible behavior . as an application we consider a fluorescent system monitored by an inefficient photon detector . this feature is taken into account through a fictitious classical two - level system . the average purity of the smoothed quantum state increases over that of the ( mixed ) state obtained from the standard quantum jump approach .
