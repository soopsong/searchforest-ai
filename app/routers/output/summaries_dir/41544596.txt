we study the synchronization of dissipatively - coupled van der pol oscillators in the quantum limit , when each oscillator is near its quantum ground state . two quantum oscillators with different frequencies exhibit an entanglement tongue , which is the quantum analogue of an arnold tongue . it means that the oscillators are entangled in steady state when the coupling strength is greater than a critical value , and the critical coupling increases with detuning . an ensemble of many oscillators with random frequencies still exhibits a synchronization phase transition in the quantum limit , and we analytically calculate how the critical coupling depends on the frequency disorder . our results can be experimentally observed with trapped ions or neutral atoms .
