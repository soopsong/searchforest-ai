based on the recent derivation of quadrature bases that incorporate the spatiotemporal degrees of freedom [ phys . rev . a 98 , 043841 ( 2018 ) ] , we develop a wigner functional theory for quantum optics , as an extension of the moyal formalism . since the spatiotemporal quadrature bases span the complete hilbert space of all quantum optical states , it does not require factorization as a tensor product of discrete hilbert spaces . the wigner functions associated with such a space become functionals and operations are expressed by functional integrals --- the functional version of the star product . the resulting formalism enables tractable calculations for scenarios where both spatiotemporal degrees of freedom and particle - number degrees of freedom are relevant . to demonstrate it , we compute examples of wigner functionals for a few well - known states and operators .
