inhomogeneity , in its many forms , appears frequently in practical physical systems . readily apparent in quantum systems , inhomogeneity is caused by hardware imperfections , measurement inaccuracies , and environmental variations , and subsequently limits the performance and efficiency achievable in current experiments . in this paper , we provide a systematic methodology to mathematically characterize and optimally manipulate inhomogeneous ensembles with concepts taken from ensemble control . in particular , we develop a computational method to solve practical quantum pulse design problems cast as optimal ensemble control problems , based on multidimensional pseudospectral approximations . we motivate the utility of this method by designing pulses for both standard and novel applications . we also show the convergence of the pseudospectral method for optimal ensemble control . the concepts developed here are applicable beyond quantum control , such as to neuron systems , and furthermore to systems with by parameter uncertainty , which pervade all areas of science and engineering .
