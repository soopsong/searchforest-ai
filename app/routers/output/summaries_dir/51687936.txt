matters falling into and consisting of a blackhole can oscillate periodically across instead of accumulate statically on the central point and form singularities there . in quantum language , this oscillation not only resolves central singularities of the blackhole but also blurs its horizon remarkably . this blurring makes the horizon not a zero - thickness geometric surface any more , but an extended physic region whose thickness is comparable with the horizon radius itself . it is our negligence of this fact that leads to the information missing puzzle , and other related question in blackhole physics . besides the title question and schwarzschild singularity 's resolving , the current work also provides interpretations for the origin of bekenstein - hawking entropy and an explicitly unitary formulation of hawking radiations .
