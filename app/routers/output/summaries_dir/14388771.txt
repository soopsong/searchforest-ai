semigroups describing the time evolution of open quantum systems in finite dimensional spaces have generators of a special form , known as lindblad generators . the simple generators , characterized by only one operator , are analyzed . the complete set of all the stationary states is presented in detail , including a formula to calculate a stationary state from the generating operator . also the opposite task can be fulfilled , to construct an evolution leading to a prescribed stationary state .
