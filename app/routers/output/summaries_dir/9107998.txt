a controlled - not logic gate based on conditional spectroscopy has been demonstrated recently for a pair of superconducting flux qubits [ plantenberg et al . , nature 447 , 836 ( 2007 ) ] . here we study the fidelity of this type of gate applied to a phase qubit coupled to a resonator ( or a pair of capacitively coupled phase qubits ) . our results show that an intrinsic fidelity of more than 99 % is achievable in 45ns .
