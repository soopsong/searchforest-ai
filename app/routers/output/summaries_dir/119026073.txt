the ability of implementing quantum operations plays fundamental role in manipulating quantum systems . creation and annihilation operators which transform a quantum state to another by adding or subtracting a particle are crucial of constructing quantum description of many body quantum theory and quantum field theory . here we present a quantum algorithm to perform them by the linear combination of unitary operations associated with a two - qubit ancillary system . our method can realize creation and annihilation operators simultaneously in the subspace of the whole system . a prototypical experiment was performed with a 4-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance processor , demonstrating the algorithm via full state tomography . the creation and annihilation operators are realized with a fidelity all above 96 % and a probability about 50 % . moreover , our method can be employed to quantum random walk in an arbitrary initial state . with the prosperous development of quantum computing , our work provides a quantum control technology to implement non - unitary evolution in near - term quantum computer .
