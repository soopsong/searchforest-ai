we study the resonance interaction between two uniformly accelerated identical atoms , one excited and the other in the ground state , prepared in a correlated ( symmetric or antisymmetric ) state and interacting with the scalar field or the electromagnetic field in the vacuum state . in this case ( resonance interaction ) , the interatomic interaction is a second - order effect in the atom - field coupling . we separate the contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the resonance energy shift of the system , and show that only radiation reaction contributes , while unruh thermal fluctuations do not affect the resonance interaction . we also find that beyond a characteristic length scale related to the atomic acceleration , non - thermal effects in the radiation reaction contribution change the distance - dependence of the resonance interaction . finally , we find that previously unidentified features appear , compared with the scalar field case , when the interaction with the electromagnetic field is considered , as a consequence of the peculiar nature of the vacuum quantum noise of the electromagnetic field in a relativistically accelerated background .
