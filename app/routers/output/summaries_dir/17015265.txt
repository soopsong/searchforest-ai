a quantum harmonic oscillator ( spring subsystem ) is stabilized towards a target fock state by reservoir engineering . this passive and open - loop stabilization works by consecutive and identical hamiltonian interactions with auxiliary systems , here three - level atoms ( the auxiliary ladder subsystem ) , followed by a partial trace over these auxiliary atoms . a scalar control input governs the interaction , defining which atomic transition in the ladder subsystem is in resonance with the spring subsystem . we use it to build a time - varying interaction with individual atoms , that combines three non - commuting steps . we show that the resulting reservoir robustly stabilizes any initial spring state distributed between 0 and 4n+3 quanta of vibrations towards a pure target fock state of vibration number n. the convergence proof relies on the construction of a strict lyapunov function for the kraus map induced by this reservoir setting on the spring subsystem . simulations with realistic parameters corresponding to the quantum electrodynamics setup at ecole normale superieure further illustrate the robustness of the method .
