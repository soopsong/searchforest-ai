quantum emitters coupled to plasmonic resonators are known to allow enhanced broadband purcell factors , and such systems have been recently suggested as possible candidates for on - demand single photon sources , with fast operation speeds . however , a true single photon source has strict requirements of high efficiency ( brightness ) and quantum indistinguishability of the emitted photons , which can be quantified through two - photon interference experiments . to help address this problem , we employ and extend a recently developed quantized quasinormal mode approach , which rigorously quantizes arbitrarily lossy open system modes , to compute the key parameters that accurately quantify the figures of merit for plasmon - based single photon sources . we also present a quantized input - output theory to quantify the radiative and nonradiative quantum efficiencies . we exemplify the theory using a nanoplasmonic dimer resonator made up of two gold nanorods , which yields large purcell factors and good radiative output beta factors . considering an optically pulsed excitation scheme , we explore the key roles of pulse duration and pure dephasing on the single photon properties , and show that ultrashort pulses ( sub - ps ) are generally required for such structures , even for low temperature operation . we also quantify the role of the nonradiative beta factor both for single photon and two - photon emission processes . our general approach can be applied to a wide variety of plasmon systems , including metal - dielectrics , and cavity - waveguide systems , without recourse to phenomenological quantization schemes .
