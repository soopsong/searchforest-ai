engineering and controlling well defined states of light for quantum information applications is of increasing importance as the complexity of quantum systems grows . for example , in quantum networks high multi - photon interference visibility requires properly devised single mode sources . in this paper we propose a spontaneous parametric down conversion source based on an integrated cavity - waveguide , where single narrow - band , possibly distinct , spectral modes for the idler and the signal fields can be generated . this mode selection takes advantage of the clustering effect , due to the intrinsic dispersion of the nonlinear material . in combination with a cw laser and fast detection , our approach provides a means to engineer a source that can efficiently generate pure photons , without filtering , that is compatible with long distance quantum communication . furthermore , it is extremely flexible and could easily be adapted to a wide variety of wavelengths and applications .
