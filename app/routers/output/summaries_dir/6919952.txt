we show that there is a polynomial space algorithm that counts the number of perfect matchings in an $ n$-vertex graph in $ o^*(2^{n/2})\subset o(1.415^n)$ time . ( $ o^*(f(n))$ suppresses functions polylogarithmic in $ f(n)$).the previously fastest algorithms for the problem was the exponential space $ o^*(((1+\sqrt{5})/2)^n ) \subset o(1.619^n)$ time algorithm by koivisto , and for polynomial space , the $ o(1.942^n)$ time algorithm by nederlof . our new algorithm 's runtime matches up to polynomial factors that of ryser 's 1963 algorithm for bipartite graphs . we present our algorithm in the more general setting of computing the hafnian over an arbitrary ring , analogously to ryser 's algorithm for permanent computation . we also give a simple argument why the general exact set cover counting problem over a slightly superpolynomial sized family of subsets of an $ n$ element ground set can not be solved in $ o^*(2^{(1-\epsilon_1)n})$ time for any $ \epsilon_1>0 $ unless there are $ o^*(2^{(1-\epsilon_2)n})$ time algorithms for computing an $ n\times n$ 0/1 matrix permanent , for some $ \epsilon_2>0 $ depending only on $ \epsilon_1$.
