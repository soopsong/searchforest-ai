we study the relaxation dynamics of a one - dimensional quantum spin-1/2 chain obtained by joining two semi - infinite halves supporting ballistic transport , the xx model and the xxz model . we initialize the system in a pure state with either a strong energy or magnetization imbalance and employ a matrix - product state ansatz of the wavefunction to numerically assess the long - time dynamics . we show that the relaxation process takes place inside a light cone , as in homogeneous ballistic systems . differently from that case , in the light cone two qualitatively different regions coexist : an internal one close to the junction , with a strong tendency towards thermalization , and an outer one supporting ballistic transport . we argue that at infinite times the system relaxes to an out - of - equilibrium steady state which exhibits stationary currents with a non - zero thermal kapitza boundary resistance at the junction . this scenario is corroborated via generalized hydrodynamic calculations of the long - time dynamics of an ohmic model where the two halves are coupled by a chaotic junction .
