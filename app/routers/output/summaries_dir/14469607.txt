two types of results are presented for distinguishing pure bipartite quantum states using local operations and classical communications . we examine sets of states that can be perfectly distinguished , in particular showing that any three orthogonal maximally entangled states in c^3 tensor c^3 form such a set . in cases where orthogonal states can not be distinguished , we obtain upper bounds for the probability of error using locc taken over all sets of k orthogonal states in c^n tensor c^m . in the process of proving these bounds , we identify some sets of orthogonal states for which perfect distinguishability is not possible .
