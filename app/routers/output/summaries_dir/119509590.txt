conventional coherent states ( css ) are defined in various ways . for example , cs is defined as an infinite poissonian expansion in fock states , as displaced vacuum state , or as an eigenket of annihilation operator . in the infinite dimensional hilbert space , these definitions are equivalent . however , these definitions are not equivalent for the finite dimensional systems . in this work , we present a comparative description of the lower- and higher - order nonclassical properties of the finite dimensional css which are also referred to as qudit css ( qcss ) . for the comparison , nonclassical properties of two types of qcss are used : ( i ) nonlinear qcs produced by applying a truncated displacement operator on the vacuum and ( ii ) linear qcs produced by the poissonian expansion in fock states of the cs truncated at ( d-1)-photon fock state . the comparison is performed using a set of nonclassicality witnesses ( e.g. , higher order antiubunching , higher order sub - poissonian statistics , higher order squeezing , agarwal - tara parameter , klyshko 's criterion ) and a set of quantitative measures of nonclassicality ( e.g. , negativity potential , concurrence potential and anticlassicality ) . the higher order nonclassicality witness have found to reveal the existence of higher order nonclassical properties of qcs for the first time .
