for spins chains to be useful for quantum information processing tasks , the interaction between the spin chain and its environment generally needs to be suppressed . in this paper , we propose the use of strong static and oscillating control fields in order to effectively remove the spin chain - environment interaction . we find that our control fields can also effectively transform the spin chain hamiltonian . in particular , interaction terms which are absent in the original spin chain hamiltonian appear in the time - averaged effective hamiltonian once the control fields are applied , implying that spin - spin interactions can be engineered via the application of static and oscillating control fields . this transformation of the spin chain can then potentially be used to improve the performance of the spin chain for quantum information processing tasks . for example , our control fields can be used to achieve almost perfect quantum state transfer across a spin chain even in the presence of noise . as another example , we show how the use of particular static and oscillating control fields not only suppresses the effect of the environment , but can also improve the generation of two - spin entanglement in the spin chain .
