the accelerated development of quantum technology has reached a pivotal point . early in 2014 , several results were published demonstrating that several experimental technologies are now accurate enough to satisfy the requirements of fault - tolerant , error corrected quantum computation . while there are many technological and experimental issues that still need to be solved , the ability of experimental systems to now have error rates low enough to satisfy the fault - tolerant threshold for several error correction models is a tremendous milestone . consequently , it is now a good time for the computer science and classical engineering community to examine the { \em classical } problems associated with compiling quantum algorithms and implementing them on future quantum hardware . in this paper , we will review the basic operational rules of a topological quantum computing architecture and outline one of the most important classical problems that need to be solved ; the decoding of error correction data for a large - scale quantum computer . we will endeavour to present these problems independently from the underlying physics as much of this work can be effectively solved by non - experts in quantum information or quantum mechanics .
