internet - scale quantum repeater networks will be heterogeneous in physical technology , repeater functionality , and management . the classical control necessary to use the network will therefore face similar issues as internet data transmission . many scalability and management problems that arose during the development of the internet might have been solved in a more uniform fashion , improving flexibility and reducing redundant engineering effort . quantum repeater network development is currently at the stage where we risk similar duplication when separate systems are combined . we propose a unifying framework that can be used with all existing repeater designs . we introduce the notion of a quantum recursive network architecture , developed from the emerging classical concept of ' recursive networks ' , extending recursive mechanisms from a focus on data forwarding to a more general distributed computing request framework . recursion abstracts independent transit networks as single relay nodes , unifies software layering , and virtualizes the addresses of resources to improve information hiding and resource management . our architecture is useful for building arbitrary distributed states , including fundamental distributed states such as bell pairs and ghz , w , and cluster states .
