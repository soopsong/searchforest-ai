using lindblad dynamics we study quantum spin systems with dissipative boundary dynamics that generate a stationary nonequilibrium state with a non - vanishing spin current that is locally conserved except at the boundaries . we demonstrate that with suitably chosen boundary target states one can solve the many - body lindblad equation exactly in any dimension . as solution we obtain pure states at any finite value of the dissipation strength and any system size . they are characterized by a helical stationary magnetization profile and a superdiffusive ballistic current of order one , independent of system size even when the quantum spin system is not integrable . these results are derived in explicit form for the one - dimensional spin-1/2 heisenberg chain and its higher - spin generalizations ( which include for spin-1 the integrable zamolodchikov - fateev model and the bi - quadratic heisenberg chain ) . the extension of the results to higher dimensions is straightforward .
