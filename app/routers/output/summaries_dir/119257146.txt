we explore theoretically the optical response properties in an optomechanical system under electromagneti- cally induced transparency condition but with the mechanical resonator being driven by an additional coherent field . in this configuration , more complex quantum coherent and interference phenomena occur . in partic- ular , we find that the probe transmission spectra depend on the total phase of the applied fields . our study also provides an efficient way to control propagation of amplification .
