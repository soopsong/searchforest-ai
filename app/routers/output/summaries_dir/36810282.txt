based on recent work on the asymptotic behavior of controlled quantum markovian dynamics , we show that any generic quantum state can be stabilized by devising constructively a simple lindblad - gks generator that can achieve global asymptotic stability at the desired state . the applications of such result is demonstrated by designing a direct feedback strategy that achieves global stabilization of a qubit state encoded in a noise - protected subspace .
