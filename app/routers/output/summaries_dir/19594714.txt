we consider how much entanglement can be produced by a non - local two - qubit unitary operation , $ u_{ab}$ - the entangling capacity of $ u_{ab}$. for a single application of $ u_{ab}$ , with no ancillas , we find the entangling capacity and show that it generally helps to act with $ u_{ab}$ on an entangled state . allowing ancillas , we present numerical results from which we can conclude , quite generally , that allowing initial entanglement typically increases the optimal capacity in this case as well . next , we show that allowing collective processing does not increase the entangling capacity if initial entanglement is allowed .
