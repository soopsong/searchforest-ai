employing a recently proposed separability criterion we develop analytical lower bounds for the concurrence and for the entanglement of formation of bipartite quantum systems . the separability criterion is based on a nondecomposable positive map which operates on state spaces with even dimension n>= 4 , and leads to a class of nondecomposable optimal entanglement witnesses . it is shown that the bounds derived here complement and improve the existing bounds obtained from the criterion of positive partial transposition and from the realignment criterion .
