granting information privacy is of crucial importance in our society , notably in fiber communication networks . quantum cryptography provides a unique means to establish , at remote locations , identical strings of genuine random bits , with a level of secrecy unattainable using classical resources . however , several constraints , such as non - optimized photon number statistics and resources , detectors ' noise , and optical losses , currently limit the performances in terms of both achievable secret key rates and distances . here , these issues are addressed using an approach that combines both fundamental and off - the - shelves technological resources . high - quality bipartite photonic entanglement is distributed over a 150 km fiber link , exploiting a wavelength demultiplexing strategy implemented at the end - user locations . it is shown how coincidence rates scale linearly with the number of employed telecommunication channels , with values outperforming previous realizations by almost one order of magnitude . thanks to its potential of scalability and compliance with device - independent strategies , this system is ready for real quantum applications , notably entanglement - based quantum cryptography .
