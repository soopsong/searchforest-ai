we study a fully on - fiber optomechanical cavity and characterize its performance as a sensor . the cavity is formed by patterning a suspended metallic mirror near the tip of an optical fiber and by introducing a static reflector inside the fiber . optically induced self - excited oscillation ( seo ) is observed above a threshold value of the injected laser power . the seo phase can be synchronized by periodically modulating the optical power that is injected into the cavity . noise properties of the system in the region of synchronization are investigated . moreover , the spectrum is measured near different values of the modulation frequency , at which phase locking occurs . a universal behavior is revealed in the transition between the regions of phase locked and free running seo .
