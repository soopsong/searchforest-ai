we use the dynamical algebra of a quantum system and its dynamical invariants to inverse engineer feasible hamiltonians for implementing shortcuts to adiabaticity . these are speeded up processes that end up with the same populations than slow , adiabatic ones . as application examples we design families of shortcut hamiltonians that drive two and a three - level systems between initial and final configurations imposing physically motivated constraints on the terms ( generators ) allowed in the hamiltonian .
