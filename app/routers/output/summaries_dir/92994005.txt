bragg - reflection waveguides ( brws ) fabricated from algaas provide an interesting non - linear optical platform for photon - pair generation via parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) . in contrast to many conventional pdc sources , brws are made of high refractive index materials and their characteristics are very sensitive to the underlying layer structure . first , we show that the design parameters like the phasematching wavelength and the group refractive indices of the interacting modes can be reliably controlled even in the presence of fabrication tolerances . we then investigate , how these characteristics can be taken advantage of when designing quantum photonic applications with brws . we especially concentrate on achieving a small differential group delay between the generated photons of a pair and then explore the performance of our design when realizing a hong - ou - mandel interference experiment or generating spectrally multi - band polarization entangled states . our results show that the versatility provided by engineering the dispersion in brws is important for employing them in different quantum optics tasks .
