we study the controllability of a closed control - affine quantum system driven by two or more external fields . we provide a sufficient condition for controllability in terms of existence of conical intersections between eigenvalues of the hamiltonian in dependence of the controls seen as parameters . such spectral condition is structurally stable in the case of three controls or in the case of two controls when the hamiltonian is real . the spectral condition appears naturally in the adiabatic control framework and yields approximate controllability in the infinite - dimensional case . in the finite - dimensional case it implies that the system is lie - bracket generating when lifted to the group of unitary transformations , and in particular that it is exactly controllable . hence , lie algebraic conditions are deduced from purely spectral properties . we conclude the article by proving that approximate and exact controllability are equivalent properties for general finite - dimensional quantum systems .
