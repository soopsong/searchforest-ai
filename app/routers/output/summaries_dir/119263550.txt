the p\'olya number characterizes the recurrence of a random walk . we apply the generalization of this concept to quantum walks [ m. \v{s}tefa\v{n}\'ak , i. jex and t. kiss , phys . rev . lett . \textbf{100 } , 020501 ( 2008 ) ] which is based on a specific measurement scheme . the p\'olya number of a quantum walk depends in general on the choice of the coin and the initial coin state , in contrast to classical random walks where the lattice dimension uniquely determines it . we analyze several examples to depict the variety of possible recurrence properties . first , we show that for the class of quantum walks driven by independent coins for all spatial dimensions , the p\'olya number is independent of the initial conditions and the actual coin operators , thus resembling the property of the classical walks . we provide an analytical estimation of the p\'olya number for this class of quantum walks . second , we examine the 2-d grover walk , which exhibits localisation and thus is recurrent , except for a particular initial state for which the walk is transient . we generalize the grover walk to show that one can construct in arbitrary dimensions a quantum walk which is recurrent . this is in great contrast with the classical walks which are recurrent only for the dimensions $ d=1,2$. finally , we analyze the recurrence of the 2-d fourier walk . this quantum walk is recurrent except for a two - dimensional subspace of the initial states . we provide an analytical formula of the p\'olya number in its dependence on the initial state .
