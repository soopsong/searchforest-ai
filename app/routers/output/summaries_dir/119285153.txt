this paper is devoted to the study of continuous - time processes known as continuous - time open quantum walks ( ctoqws ) . a ctoqw represents the evolution of a quantum particle constrained to move on a discrete graph , but also has internal degrees of freedom modeled by a state ( in the quantum mechanical sense ) , and contain as a special case continuous - time markov chains on graphs . recurrence and transience of a vertex are an important notion in the study of markov chains , and it is known that all vertices must be of the same nature if the markov chain is irreducible . in the present paper we address the corresponding results in the context of irreducible ctoqws . because of the"quantum"internal degrees of freedom , ctoqws exhibit non standard behavior , and the classification of recurrence and transience properties obeys a"trichotomy"rather than the classical dichotomy . essential tools in this paper are the so - called"quantum trajectories"which are jump stochastic differential equations which can be associated with ctoqws .
