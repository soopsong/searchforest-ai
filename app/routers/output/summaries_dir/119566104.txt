open quantum walks ( oqws ) , originally introduced by s. attal , are quantum generalizations of classical markov chains . recently , natural continuous time models of oqw have been developed by c. pellegrini . these models , called continuous time open quantum walks ( ctoqws ) , appear as natural continuous time limits of discrete time oqws . in particular they are quantum extensions of continuous time markov chains . this article is devoted to the study of homogeneous ctoqw on $ \mathbb{z}^d$. we focus namely on their associated quantum trajectories which allow us to prove a central limit theorem for the"position"of the walker as well as a large deviation principle .
