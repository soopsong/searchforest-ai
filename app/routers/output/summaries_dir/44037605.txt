we demonstrate sensing of inhomogeneous dc magnetic fields by employing entangled trapped ions , which are shuttled in a segmented paul trap . as \textit{sensor states } , we use bell states of the type $ \left|\uparrow\downarrow\right>+\text{e}^{\text{i}\varphi}\left|\downarrow\uparrow\right>$ encoded in two $ ^{40}$ca$^+$ ions stored at different locations . due to the linear zeeman effect , the relative phase $ \varphi$ serves to measure the magnetic field difference between the constituent locations , while common - mode fluctuations are rejected . consecutive measurements on sensor states encoded in the $ \text{s}_{1/2}$ ground state and in the $ \text{d}_{5/2}$ metastable state are used to separate an ac zeeman shift from the linear dc zeeman effect . we measure magnetic field differences over distances of up to $ 6.2~\text{mm}$ , with accuracies of around 300~ft , sensitivities down to $ 12~\text{pt } / \sqrt{\text{hz}}$ , and spatial resolutions down to $ 10~\text{nm}$. for optimizing the information gain while maintaining a high dynamic range , we implement an algorithm for bayesian frequency estimation .
