frames for operators or k - frames were recently considered by gavruta ( 2012 ) in connection with atomic systems . also generalized frames are important frames in the hilbert space of bounded linear operators . fusion frames , which are a special case of generalized frames have various applications . this paper introduces the concept of generalized fusion frames for operators aka k - g - fusion frames and we get some results for characterization of these frames . we further discuss on duals and q - duals in connection with k - g - fusion frames . also we obtain some useful identities for these frames . we also give several methods to construct k - g - fusion frames . the results of this paper can be used in sampling theory which are developed by g - frames and especially fusion frames . in the end , we discuss the stability of a more general perturbation for k - g - fusion frames .
