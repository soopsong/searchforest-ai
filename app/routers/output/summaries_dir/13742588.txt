this work addresses the optimal covariance control problem for stochastic discrete - time linear time - varying systems subject to chance constraints . covariance steering is a stochastic control problem to steer the system state gaussian distribution to another gaussian distribution while minimizing a cost function . to the best of our knowledge , covariance steering problems have never been discussed with probabilistic chance constraints although it is a natural extension . in this work , first we show that , unlike the case with no chance constraints , the covariance steering with chance constraints problem can not decouple the mean and covariance steering sub - problems . then we propose an approach to solve the covariance steering with chance constraints problem by converting it to a semidefinite programming problem . the proposed algorithm is verified using two simple numerical simulations .
