hybrid architectures integrating mesoscopic electronic conductors with resonant microwave cavities have a great potential for investigating unexplored regimes of electron - photon coupling . in this context , producing nonclassical squeezed light is a key step towards quantum communication with scalable solid - state devices . here we show that parametric driving of the electronic conductor induces a squeezed steady state in the cavity . we find that squeezing properties of the cavity are essentially determined by the electronic noise correlators of the quantum conductor . in the case of a tunnel junction , we predict that squeezing is optimized by applying a time - periodic series of quantized $ \delta-$peaks in the bias voltage . for an asymmetric quantum dot , we show that a sharp leviton pulse is able to achieve perfect cavity squeezing .
