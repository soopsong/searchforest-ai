we provide a solution to the problem of determining whether a target pure state can be asymptotically prepared using dissipative markovian dynamics under fixed locality constraints . beside recovering existing results for a large class of physically relevant entangled states , our approach has the advantage of providing an explicit stabilization test solely based on the input state and constraints of the problem . connections with the formalism of frustration - free parent hamiltonians are discussed , as well as control implementations in terms of a switching output - feedback law .
