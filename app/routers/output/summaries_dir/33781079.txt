the problem of distinguishing two unitary transformations , or quantum gates , is analyzed and a function reflecting their statistical distinguishability is found . given two unitary operations , $ u_1 $ and $ u_2 $ , it is proved that there always exists a finite number $ n$ such that $ u_1^{\otimes n}$ and $ u_2^{\otimes n}$ are perfectly distinguishable , although they were not in the single - copy case . this result can be extended to any finite set of unitary transformations . finally , a fidelity for one - qubit gates , which satisfies many useful properties from the point of view of quantum information theory , is presented .
