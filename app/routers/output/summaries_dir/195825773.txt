quantum simulation of chemical systems is one of the most promising near - term applications of quantum computers . the variational quantum eigensolver , a leading algorithm for molecular simulations on quantum hardware , has a serious limitation in that it typically relies on a pre - selected wavefunction ansatz that results in approximate wavefunctions and energies . here we present an arbitrarily accurate variational algorithm that instead of fixing an ansatz upfront , this algorithm grows it systematically one operator at a time in a way dictated by the molecule being simulated . this generates an ansatz with a small number of parameters , leading to shallow - depth circuits . we present numerical simulations , including for a prototypical strongly correlated molecule , which show that our algorithm performs much better than a unitary coupled cluster approach , in terms of both circuit depth and chemical accuracy . our results highlight the potential of our adaptive algorithm for exact simulations with present - day and near - term quantum hardware .
