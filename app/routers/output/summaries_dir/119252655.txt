a scheme is proposed for the fast generation of three - dimensional entanglement between two atoms trapped in two cavities connected by a fiber via invariant - based shortcut to adiabatic passage . with the help of quantum zeno dynamics , the technique of invariant - based shortcut to adiabatic passage is applied for the generation of two - atom three - dimensional entanglement . the numerical simulation results show that , within a short time , the scheme has a high fidelity and is robust against the decoherence caused by the atomic spontaneous emission , photon leakage , and the variations in the parameters selected . moreover , the scheme may be possible to be implemented with the current experimental technology .
