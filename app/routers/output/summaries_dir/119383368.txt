we study different notions of quantum correlations in multipartite systems of distinguishable and indistinguishable particles . based on the definition of quantum coherence for a single particle , we consider two possible extensions of this concept to the many - particle scenario and determine the influence of the exchange symmetry . moreover , we characterize the relation of multiparticle coherence to the entanglement of the compound quantum system . to support our general treatment with examples , we consider the quantum correlations of a collection of qudits . the impact of local and global quantum superpositions on the different forms of quantum correlations is discussed . for differently correlated states in the bipartite and multipartite scenarios , we provide a comprehensive characterization of the various forms and origins of quantum correlations .
