implementation of discrete - time quantum walk ( dtqw ) with superconducting qubits is difficult since on - chip superconducting qubits can not hop between lattice sites . we propose an efficient protocol for the implementation of dtqw in circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , in which only $ n+1 $ qutrits and $ n$ assistant cavities are needed for an $ n$-step dtqw . the operation of each dtqw step is very quick because only resonant processes are adopted . the numerical simulations show that high - similarity dtqw with the number of step up to $ 20 $ is feasible with present - day circuit qed technique . this protocol can help to study properties and applications of large - step dtqw in experiments , which is important for the development of quantum computation and quantum simulation in circuit qed .
