quantum algorithm design usually assumes access to a perfect quantum computer with ideal properties like full connectivity , noise - freedom and arbitrarily long coherence time . in noisy intermediate - scale quantum ( nisq ) devices , however , the number of qubits is highly limited and quantum operation error and qubit coherence are not negligible . besides , the connectivity of physical qubits in a quantum processing unit ( qpu ) is also strictly constrained . thereby , additional operations like swap gates have to be inserted to satisfy this constraint while preserving the functionality of the original circuit . this process is known as quantum circuit transformation . adding additional gates will increase both the size and depth of a quantum circuit and therefore cause further decay of the performance of a quantum circuit . thus it is crucial to minimize the number of added gates . in this paper , we propose an efficient method to solve this problem . we first choose by using simulated annealing an initial mapping which fits well with the input circuit and then , with the help of a heuristic cost function , stepwise apply the best selected swap gates until all quantum gates in the circuit can be executed . our algorithm runs in time polynomial in all parameters including the size and the qubit number of the input circuit , and the qubit number in the qpu . its space complexity is quadratic to the number of edges in the qpu . experimental results on extensive realistic circuits confirm that the proposed method is efficient and can reduce by 57 % on average the size of the output circuits when compared with the state - of - the - art algorithm on the most recent ibm quantum device viz . ibm q20 ( tokyo ) .
