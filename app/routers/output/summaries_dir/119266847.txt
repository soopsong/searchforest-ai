a recent paper [ chuan wang , phys . rev . a \textbf{86 } , 012323 ( 2012 ) ] discussed an entanglement concentration protocol ( ecp ) for partially entangled electrons using a quantum dot and microcavity coupled system . in his paper , each two - electron spin system in a partially entangled state can be concentrated with the assistance of an ancillary quantum dot and a single photon . in this paper , we will present an optimal ecp for such entangled electrons with the help of only one single photon . compared with the protocol of wang , the most significant advantage is that during the whole ecp , the single photon only needs to pass through one microcavity which will increase the total success probability if the cavity is imperfect . the whole protocol can be repeated to get a higher success probability . with the feasible technology , this protocol may be useful in current long - distance quantum communications .
