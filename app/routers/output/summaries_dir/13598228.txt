random projections have proven extremely useful in many signal processing and machine learning applications . however , they often require either to store a very large random matrix , or to use a different , structured matrix to reduce the computational and memory costs . here , we overcome this difficulty by proposing an analog , optical device , that performs the random projections literally at the speed of light without having to store any matrix in memory . this is achieved using the physical properties of multiple coherent scattering of coherent light in random media . we use this device on a simple task of classification with a kernel machine , and we show that , on the mnist database , the experimental results closely match the theoretical performance of the corresponding kernel . this framework can help make kernel methods practical for applications that have large training sets and/or require real - time prediction . we discuss possible extensions of the method in terms of a class of kernels , speed , memory consumption and different problems .
