certain lattice wave systems in translationally invariant settings have one or more spectral bands that are strictly flat or independent of momentum in the tight binding approximation , arising from either internal symmetries or fine - tuned coupling . these flat bands display remarkable strongly - interacting phases of matter . originally considered as a theoretical convenience useful for obtaining exact analytical solutions of ferromagnetism , flat bands have now been observed in a variety of settings , ranging from electronic systems to ultracold atomic gases and photonic devices . here we review the design and implementation of flat bands and chart future directions of this exciting field .
