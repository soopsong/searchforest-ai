quantum systems whose classical counterparts are chaotic typically have highly correlated eigenvalues and level statistics that coincide with those from ensembles of full random matrices . a dynamical manifestation of these correlations comes in the form of the so - called correlation hole , which is a dip below the saturation point of the survival probability 's time evolution . in this work , we study the correlation hole in the spin - boson ( dicke ) model , which presents a chaotic regime and can be realized in experiments with ultracold atoms and ion traps . we derive an analytical expression that describes the entire evolution of the survival probability and allows us to determine the timescales of its relaxation to equilibrium . this expression shows remarkable agreement with our numerical results . while the initial decay and the time to reach the minimum of the correlation hole depend on the initial state , the dynamics beyond the hole up to equilibration is universal . we find that the relaxation time of the survival probability for the dicke model increases linearly with system size .
