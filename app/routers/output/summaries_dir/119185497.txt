the calculation of excited state energies of electronic structure hamiltonians has many important applications , such as the calculation of optical spectra and reaction rates . while low - depth quantum algorithms , such as the variational quantum eigenvalue solver ( vqe ) , have been used to determine ground state energies , methods for calculating excited states currently involve the implementation of high - depth controlled - unitaries or a large number of additional samples . here we show how overlap estimation can be used to deflate eigenstates once they are found , enabling the calculation of excited state energies and their degeneracies . we propose an implementation that requires the same number of qubits as vqe and at most twice the circuit depth . our method is robust to control errors , is compatible with error - mitigation strategies and can be implemented on near - term quantum computers .
