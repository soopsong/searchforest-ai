integer linear programming ( ilp ) encompasses a very important class of optimization problems that are of great interest to both academia and industry . several algorithms are available that attempt to explore the solution space of this class efficiently , while requiring a reasonable compute time . however , although these algorithms have reached various degrees of success over the years , they still face considerable challenges when confronted with particularly hard problem instances , such as those of the miplib 2010 library . in this work we propose a radically different non - algorithmic approach to ilp based on a novel physics - inspired computing paradigm : memcomputing . this paradigm is based on digital ( hence scalable ) machines represented by appropriate electrical circuits with memory . these machines can be either built in hardware or , as we do here , their equations of motion can be efficiently simulated on our traditional computers . we first describe a new circuit architecture of memcomputing machines specifically designed to solve for the linear inequalities representing a general ilp problem . we call these self - organizing algebraic circuits , since they self - organize dynamically to satisfy the correct ( algebraic ) linear inequalities . we then show simulations of these machines using matlab running on a single core of a xeon processor for several ilp benchmark problems taken from the miplib 2010 library , and compare our results against a renowned commercial solver . we show that our approach is very efficient when dealing with these hard problems . in particular , we find within minutes feasible solutions for one of these hard problems ( f2000 from miplib 2010 ) whose feasibility , to the best of our knowledge , has remained unknown for the past eight years .
