recently , ibm has made available a quantum computer provided with 16 qubits , denoted as ibm q16 . previously , only a 5 qubit device , denoted as q5 , was available . both ibm devices can be used to run quantum programs , by means of a cloud - based platform . in this paper , we illustrate our experience with ibm q16 in demonstrating entanglement assisted invariance , also known as envariance , and parity learning by querying a uniform quantum example oracle . in particular , we illustrate the non - trivial strategy we have designed for compiling $ n$-qubit quantum circuits ( $ n$ being an input parameter ) on any ibm device , taking into account topological constraints .
