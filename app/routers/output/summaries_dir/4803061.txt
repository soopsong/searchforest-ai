we address the presence of non - distillable ( bound ) entanglement in natural many - body systems . in particular , we consider standard harmonic and spin-1/2 chains , at thermal equilibrium and characterized by few interaction parameters . the existence of bound entanglement is addressed by calculating explicitly the negativity of entanglement for different partitions . this allows to individuate a range of temperatures for which no entanglement can be distilled by means of local operations , despite the system being globally entangled . we discuss how the appearance of bound entanglement can be linked to entanglement - area laws , typical of these systems . various types of interactions and topologies are explored , showing that the presence of bound entanglement is an intrinsic feature of these systems . in the harmonic case , we analytically prove that thermal bound entanglement persists for systems composed by an arbitrary number of particles . our results strongly suggest the existence of bound entangled states in the macroscopic limit also for spin-1/2 systems .
