we derive the analytical expression of local quantum uncertainty for three - qubit x - states . we give also the expressions of quantum discord and the negativity . a comparison of these three quantum correlations quantifiers is discussed in the special cases of mixed ghz states and bell - type states . we find that local quantum uncertainty gives the same amount of non - classical correlations as are measured by entropic quantum discord and goes beyond negativity . we also discuss the dynamics of non - classical correlations under the effect of phase damping , depolarizing and phase reversal channels . we find the local quantum uncertainty shows more robustness and exhibits , under phase reversal effect , revival and frozen phenomena . the monogamy property of local quantum uncertainty is also discussed . it is shown that it is monogamous for three - qubit states .
