we consider an error model for quantum computing that consists of"contagious quantum germs"that can infect every output qubit when at least one input qubit is infected . once a germ actively causes error , it continues to cause error indefinitely for every qubit it infects , with arbitrary quantum entanglement and correlation . although this error model looks much worse than quasi - independent error , we show that it reduces to quasi - independent error with the technique of quantum teleportation . the construction , which was previously described by knill , is that every quantum circuit can be converted to a mixed circuit with bounded quantum depth . we also consider the restriction of bounded quantum depth from the point of view of quantum complexity classes .
