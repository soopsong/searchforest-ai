we introduce a new spin chain which is a deformation of the fredkin spin chain and has a phase transition between bounded and extensive entanglement entropy scaling . in this chain , spins have a local interaction of three nearest neighbors . the hamiltonian is frustration - free and its ground state can be described analytically as a weighted superposition of dyck paths . in the purely spin $ 1/2 $ case , the entanglement entropy obeys an area law : it is bounded from above by a constant , when the size of the block $ n$ increases ( and $ t>1 $ ) . when a local color degree of freedom is introduced the entanglement entropy increases linearly with the size of the block ( and $ t>1 $ ) . the entanglement entropy of half of the chain is tightly bounded by $ { n}\log s$ where $ n$ is the size of the block , and $ s$ is the number of colors . our chain fosters a new example for a significant boost to entropy and for the existence of the associated critical rainbow phase where the entanglement entropy scales with volume that has recently been discovered in zhang et al .
