we give a detailed discussion of optimal quantum states for optical two - mode interferometry in the presence of photon losses . we derive analytical formulae for the precision of phase estimation obtainable using quantum states of light with a definite photon number and prove that maximization of the precision is a convex optimization problem . the corresponding optimal precision , i.e. the lowest possible uncertainty , is shown to beat the standard quantum limit thus outperforming classical interferometry . furthermore , we discuss more general inputs : states with indefinite photon number and states with photons distributed between distinguishable time bins . we prove that neither of these is helpful in improving phase estimation precision .
