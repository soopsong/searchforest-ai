here we focus on the measurement induced nonlocality and present a redefinition in terms of the skew information subject to a broken observable . it is shown that the obtained quantity possesses an obvious operational meaning , can tackle the noncontractivity of the measurement induced nonlocality and has analytic expressions for many quantum states . most importantly , an inverse approximate joint diagonalization algorithm , due to its simplicity , high efficiency , stability , and state independence , is presented to provide almost analytic expressions for any quantum state , which can also shed light on other aspects in physics .
