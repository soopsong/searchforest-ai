we consider an optical and mechanical mode interacting through both linear and quadratic dispersive couplings in a general cavity - optomechanical set - up . the parity and strength of an intrinsic quadratic optomechanical coupling ( qoc ) provides an opportunity to control the optomechanical ( om ) interaction . we quantify this interaction by studying normal - mode splitting ( nms ) as a function of the qoc 's strength . the proposed scheme exhibits nms features equivalent to a hybrid - om system containing either an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) or a kerr medium . such a system in reality could offer an alternative platform for devising state - of - art quantum devices with requiring no extra degrees - of - freedom as in hybrid - om systems .
