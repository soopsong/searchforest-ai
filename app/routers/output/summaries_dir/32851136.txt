the efficient conversion of thermal energy to mechanical work by a heat engine is an ongoing technological challenge . since the pioneering work of carnot , it is known that the efficiency of heat engines is bounded by a fundamental upper limit , the carnot limit . theoretical studies suggest that heat engines may be operated beyond the carnot limit by exploiting stationary , non - equilibrium reservoirs that are characterized by a temperature as well as further parameters . in a proof - of - principle experiment , we demonstrate that the efficiency of a nano - beam heat engine coupled to squeezed thermal noise is not bounded by the standard carnot limit . remarkably , we also show that it is possible to design a cyclic process that allows for extraction of mechanical work from a single squeezed thermal reservoir . our results demonstrate a qualitatively new regime of non - equilibrium thermodynamics at small scales and provide a new perspective on the design of efficient , highly miniaturized engines .
