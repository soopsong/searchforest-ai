we show that mode - mixing quantum gates can be produced by non - uniform relativistic acceleration . periodic motion in cavities exhibits a series of resonant conditions producing entangling quantum gates between different frequency modes . the resonant condition associated with particle creation is the main feature of the dynamical casimir effect which has been recently demonstrated in superconducting circuits . we show that a second resonance , which has attracted less attention since it implies negligible particle production , produces a beam splitting quantum gate leading to a resonant enhancement of entanglement which can be used as the first evidence of acceleration effects in mechanical oscillators . we propose a desktop experiment where the frequencies associated with this second resonance can be produced mechanically .
