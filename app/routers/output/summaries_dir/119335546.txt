we prove a no - go theorem for storing quantum information in equilibrium systems . namely , quantum information can not be stored in a system with time - independent hamiltonian interacting with heat bath of temperature $ t>0 $ during time that grows with the number of used qubits . we prove it by showing , that storing quantum information for macroscopic time would imply existence of perpetuum mobile of the second kind . the general results are illustrated by the kitaev model of quantum memory . in contrast , classical information can be stored in equilibrium states for arbitrary long times . we show how it is possible via phase - transition type phenomena . our result shows that there is a fundamental difference between quantum and classical information in { \it physical } terms .
