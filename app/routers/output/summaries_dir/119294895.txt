we review ` particle partitioning entanglement ' for itinerant many - particle systems . this is defined as the entanglement between two subsets of particles making up the system . we identify generic features and mechanisms of particle entanglement that are valid over whole classes of itinerant quantum systems . we formulate the general structure of particle entanglement in many - fermion ground states , analogous to the ` area law ' for the more usually studied entanglement between spatial regions . basic properties of particle entanglement are first elucidated by considering relatively simple itinerant models . we then review particle - partitioning entanglement in quantum states with more intricate physics , such as anyonic models and quantum hall states .
