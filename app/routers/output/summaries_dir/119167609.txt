we develop a technique for finding the dynamical evolution in time of an averaged density matrix . the result is an equation of evolution that includes an effective hamiltonian , as well as decoherence terms in lindblad form . applying the general equation to harmonic hamiltonians , we confirm a previous formula for the effective hamiltonian together with a new decoherence term which should in general be included , and whose vanishing provides the criteria for validity of the effective hamiltonian approach . finally , we apply the theory to examples of the ac stark shift and three- level raman transitions , recovering a new decoherence effect in the latter .
