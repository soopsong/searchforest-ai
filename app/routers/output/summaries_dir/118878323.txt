a measure of total correlations can not increase under deterministic local operations . we show that , for any number of systems , this condition alone does not guarantee the existence of maximally correlated states . namely , there is no state that simultaneously maximizes all the measures satisfying it . if , in addition , the measures do not increase with probability unity under local measurements , then such states exist for two systems . they are the maximally entangled states . for a larger number of systems , it depends on their hilbert space dimensions .
