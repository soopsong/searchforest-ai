we have theoretically studied the effect of deterministic temporal control of spontaneous emission in a dynamic optical microcavity . we propose a new paradigm in light emission : we envision an ensemble of two - level emitters in an environment where the local density of optical states is modified on a time scale shorter than the decay time . a rate equation model is developed for the excited state population of two - level emitters in a time - dependent environment in the weak coupling regime in quantum electrodynamics . as a realistic experimental system , we consider emitters in a semiconductor microcavity that is switched by free - carrier excitation . we demonstrate that a short temporal increase of the radiative decay rate depletes the excited state and drastically increases the emission intensity during the switch time . the resulting time - dependent spontaneous emission shows a distribution of photon arrival times that strongly deviates from the usual exponential decay : a deterministic burst of photons is spontaneously emitted during the switch event .
