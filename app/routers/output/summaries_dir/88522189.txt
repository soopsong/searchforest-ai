quantum computing for machine learning attracts increasing attention and recent technological developments suggest that especially adiabatic quantum computing may soon be of practical interest . in this paper , we therefore consider this paradigm and discuss how to adopt it to the problem of binary clustering . numerical simulations demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and illustrate how systems of qubits adiabatically evolve towards a solution .
