we compute the photon creation inside a perfectly conducting , three dimensional oscillating cavity , taking the polarization of the electromagnetic field into account . as the boundary conditions for this field are both of dirichlet and ( generalized ) neumann type , we analyze as a preliminary step the dynamical casimir effect for a scalar field satisfying generalized neumann boundary conditions . we show that particle production is enhanced with respect to the case of dirichlet boundary conditions . then we consider the transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations of the electromagnetic field . for resonant frequencies , the total number of photons grows exponentially in time for both polarizations , the rate being greater for transverse magnetic modes .
