eigenstates of permutation gates are either stabilizer states ( for gates in the pauli group ) or magic states , thus allowing universal quantum computation [ m. planat and rukhsan - ul - haq , preprint 1701.06443 ] . we show in this paper that a subset of such magic states , when acting on the generalized pauli group , define ( asymmetric ) informationally complete povms . such ic - povms , investigated in dimensions $ 2 $ to $ 12 $ , exhibit simple finite geometries in their projector products and , for dimensions $ 4 $ and $ 8 $ and $ 9 $ , relate to two - qubit , three - qubit and two - qutrit contextuality .
