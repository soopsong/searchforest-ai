we consider the separability of various joint states of d - dimensional quantum systems , which we call"qudits . "we derive two main results : ( i ) the separability condition for a two - qudit state that is a mixture of the maximally mixed state and a maximally entangled state ; ( ii ) lower and upper bounds on the size of the neighorhood of separable states surrounding the maximally mixed state for n qudits .
