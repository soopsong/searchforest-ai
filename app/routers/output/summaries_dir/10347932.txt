we introduce and study quantized versions of cop and robber game . we achieve this by using graph - preserving quantum operations , which are the quantum analogues of stochastic operations preserving the graph . we provide the tight bound for the number of operations required to reach the given state . by extending them to the controlled operations , we define a quantum - controlled cop and robber game , which expands the classical cop and robber game , as well as the classically controlled quantum cop and robber game . in contrast to the typical scheme for introducing quantum games , we assume that both parties can utilise full information about the opponent 's strategy . we show that the utilisation of the full knowledge about the opponent 's state does not provide the advantage . moreover , the chances of catching the robber decrease for classical cop - win graphs . this result does not depend on the chosen model of evolution . on the other hand , the possibility to execute controlled quantum operations allows catching the robber on almost all classical cop - win graphs . by this , we demonstrate that it is necessary to enrich the structure of correlations between the players ' systems to provide a non - trivial quantized cop and robber game . thus the quantum controlled operations offer a significant advantage over the classically controlled quantum operations .
