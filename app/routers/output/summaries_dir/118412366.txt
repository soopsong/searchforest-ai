dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) is the name assigned to the process of generating quanta from vacuum due to an accelerated motion of macroscopic neutral bodies ( mirrors ) or time - modulation of cavity material properties , as well as the simulation of such processes . here i review the theoretical results on the detection of dce using intracavity quantum detectors , such as multi - level atoms , atomic networks and harmonic oscillators . i also stress the mathematical equivalence of this problem to the physics of optical parametric oscillators interacting with atoms or quantum wells , studied in quantum nonlinear optics .
