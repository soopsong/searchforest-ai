the dimension of the state space for information encoding offered by the transverse structure of light is usually limited by the finite size of apertures . the widely used orbital angular momentum ( oam ) number of laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) modes in free - space communications can not achieve the theoretical maximum transmission capacity unless the radial degree of freedom is multiplexed into the protocol . while the methodology to sort the radial quantum number has been developed , the application of radial modes in quantum communications requires an additional ability to efficiently measure the superposition of lg modes in the mutually unbiased basis . here we develop and implement a generic mode sorter that is capable of sorting the superposition of lg modes through the use of a mode converter . as a consequence , we demonstrate an 8-dimensional quantum key distribution experiment involving all three transverse degrees of freedom : spin , azimuthal , and radial quantum numbers of photons . our protocol presents an important step towards the goal of reaching the capacity limit of a free - space link and can be useful to other applications that involve spatial modes of photons .
