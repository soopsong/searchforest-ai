proposed in 1984 , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) allows two users to exchange provably secure keys via a potentially insecure quantum channel . since then , qkd has attracted much attention and significant progress has been made in both theory and practice . on the application front , however , the operating distance of practical fibre - based qkd systems is limited to about 150 km , which is mainly due to the high background noise produced by commonly used semiconductor single - photon detectors ( spds ) and the stringent demand on the minimum classical- post - processing ( cpp ) block size . here , we present a compact and autonomous qkd system that is capable of distributing provably - secure cryptographic key over 307 km of ultra - low - loss optical fibre ( 51.9 db loss ) . the system is based on a recently developed standard semiconductor ( ingaas ) spds with record low background noise and a novel efficient finite - key security analysis for qkd . this demonstrates the feasibility of practical long - distance qkd based on standard fibre optic telecom components .
