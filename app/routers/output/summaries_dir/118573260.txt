we study a general theory of phonon lasing [ i. s. grudinin et al . , phys . rev . lett . 104 , 083901 ( 2010 ) ] in coupled optomechancial systems . we derive the dynamical equation of the phonon lasing using supermodes formed by two cavity modes . a general threshold condition for phonon lasing is obtained . we also show the differences between phonon lasing and photon lasing , generated by photonic supermodes and two - level atomic systems , respectively . we find that the phonon lasing can be realized in certain parameter regime near the threshold . the phase diagram and second - order correlation function of the phonon lasing are also studied to show some interesting phenomena that can not be observed in the common photon lasing with the two - level systems .
