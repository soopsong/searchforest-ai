we present a general approach to calculating the entanglement of formation for superpositions of two - mode coherent states , placed equidistantly on a circle in the phase space . we show that in the particular case of rotationally - invariant circular states the schmidt decomposition of two modes , and therefore the value of their entanglement , are given by analytical expressions . we analyse the dependence of the entanglement on the radius of the circle and number of components in the superposition . we also show that the set of rotationally - invariant circular states creates an orthonormal basis in the state space of the harmonic oscillator , and this basis is advantageous for representation of other circular states of light .
