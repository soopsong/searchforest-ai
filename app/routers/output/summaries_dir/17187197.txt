exploiting the peculiar properties of proximity - induced superconductivity on the surface of a topological insulator , we propose a device which allows the creation of a majorana fermion inside the core of a pinned abrikosov vortex . the relevant bogolyubov - de gennes equations are studied analytically . we demonstrate that in this system the zero - energy majorana fermion state is separated by a large energy gap , of the order of the zero - temperature superconducting gap $ \delta$ , from a band of single - particle non - topological excitations . in other words , the majorana fermion remains robust against thermal fluctuations , as long as the temperature remains substantially lower than the critical superconducting temperature . experimentally , the majorana state may be detected by measuring the tunneling differential conductance at the center of the abrikosov vortex . in such an experiment , the majorana state manifests itself as a zero - bias anomaly separated by a gap , of the order of $ \delta$ , from the contributions of the nontopological excitations .
