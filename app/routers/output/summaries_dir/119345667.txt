we propose a realistic scheme to implement discrete - time quantum walks in the brillouin zone ( i.e. , in quasimomentum space ) with a spinor bose - einstein condensate . relying on a static optical lattice to suppress tunneling in real space , the condensate is displaced in quasimomentum space in discrete steps conditioned upon the internal state of the atoms , while short pulses periodically couple the internal states . we show that tunable twisted boundary conditions can be implemented in a fully natural way by exploiting the periodicity of the brillouin zone . the proposed setup does not suffer from off - resonant scattering of photons and could allow a robust implementation of quantum walks with several tens of steps at least . in addition , onsite atom - atom interactions can be used to simulate interactions with infinitely long range in the brillouin zone .
