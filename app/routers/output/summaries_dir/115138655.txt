we introduce and test an algorithm that adaptively estimates large deviation functions characterizing the fluctuations of additive functionals of markov processes in the long - time limit . these functions play an important role for predicting the probability and pathways of rare events in stochastic processes , as well as for understanding the physics of nonequilibrium systems driven in steady states by external forces and reservoirs . the algorithm uses methods from risk - sensitive and feedback control to estimate from a single trajectory a new process , called the driven process , known to be efficient for importance sampling . its advantages compared to other simulation techniques , such as splitting or cloning , are discussed and illustrated with simple equilibrium and nonequilibrium diffusion models .
