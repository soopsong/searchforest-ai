we derive explicit expressions for the quantum fisher information and the symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) of a quantum state in the exponential form ; the sld is expressed in terms of the generator . applications include quantum - metrology problems with gaussian states and general thermal states . specifically , we give the sld for a gaussian state in two forms , in terms of its generator and its moments ; the fisher information is also calculated for both forms . special cases are discussed , including pure , degenerate , and very noisy gaussian states .
