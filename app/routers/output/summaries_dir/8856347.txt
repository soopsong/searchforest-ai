analytic expressions for the probability density distribution of the linear entropy and the purity are derived for bipartite pure random quantum states . the explicit distributions for a state belonging to a product of hilbert spaces of dimensions p and q are given for p=3 and any q>=3 , as well as for p = q=4 .
