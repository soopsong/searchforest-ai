we study the creation of a spherical , finite radius source for a quantized massless scalar field in 3 + 1 dimensions . the goal is to model the breakdown of correlations that has been proposed to occur at the horizon of an evaporating black hole . we do this by introducing at fixed radius $ r = a$ a one parameter family of self - adjoint extensions of the three dimensional laplacian operator that interpolate between the condition that the values and the derivatives on the two sides of $ r = a$ coincide for $ t\le0 $ ( no wall ) and the two - sided dirichlet boundary condition for $ t \ge 1/\lambda$ ( fully - developed wall ) . creation of the shell produces null , spherical pulses of energy on either side of the shell , one ingoing and the other outgoing . the renormalized energy density $ \langle t_{00}\rangle$ diverges to positive infinity in the outgoing energy pulse , just outside the light cone of the fully - formed wall at $ t=1/\lambda$. unlike in the 3 + 1 point source creation , there is no persistent memory cloud of energy . as in the creation of a 1 + 1 dimensional wall , the response of an unruh - dewitt detector in the post - shell region is independent of the time scale for shell formation and is finite . the latter property casts doubt on the efficacy of this mechanism for firewall creation .
