in this work , we show that a complex equiangular tight frame ( etf ) composed by $ n$ vectors in dimension $ d$ exists if and only if a certain bistochastic matrix , univocally determined by $ n$ and $ d$ , belongs to a special class of unistochastic matrices . this connection allows us to find new complex etf in infinitely many dimensions and to derive a method to introduce non - trivial free parameters in etf . we derive a 6-parametric family of complex etf(6,16 ) , which defines a family of symmetric povm . minimal and maximal possible average entanglement of the vectors within this qubit - qutrit family are presented . furthermore , we propose an efficient numerical procedure to find the unitary matrix underlying a unistochastic matrix , which we apply to find all existing classes of complex etf containing up to 19 vectors .
