we consider the problem of interconverting a finite amount of resources within all theories whose single - shot transformation rules are based on a majorisation relation , e.g. the resource theories of entanglement and coherence ( for pure state transformations ) , as well as thermodynamics ( for energy - incoherent transformations ) . when only finite resources are available we expect to see a non - trivial trade - off between the rate $ r_n$ at which $ n$ copies of a resource state $ \rho$ can be transformed into $ nr_n$ copies of another resource state $ \sigma$ , and the error level $ \varepsilon_n$ of the interconversion process , as a function of $ n$. in this work we derive the optimal trade - off in the so - called moderate deviation regime , where the rate of interconversion $ r_n$ approaches its optimum in the asymptotic limit of unbounded resources ( $ n\to\infty$ ) , while the error $ \epsilon_n$ vanishes in the same limit . we find that the moderate deviation analysis exhibits a resonance behaviour which implies that certain pairs of resource states can be interconverted at the asymptotically optimal rate with negligible error , even in the finite $ n$ regime .
