perceptrons are the basic computational unit of artificial neural networks , as they model the activation mechanism of an output neuron due to incoming signals from its neighbours . as linear classifiers , they play an important role in the foundations of machine learning . in the context of the emerging field of quantum machine learning , several attempts have been made to develop a corresponding unit using quantum information theory . based on the quantum phase estimation algorithm , this paper introduces a quantum perceptron model imitating the step - activation function of a classical perceptron . this scheme requires resources in $ \mathcal{o}(n)$ ( where $ n$ is the size of the input ) and promises efficient applications for more complex structures such as trainable quantum neural networks .
