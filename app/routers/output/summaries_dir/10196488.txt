we consider realistic , multi - parameter error models and investigate the performance of the surface code for three possible fault - tolerant superconducting quantum computer architectures . we map amplitude and phase damping to a diagonal pauli"depolarization"channel via the pauli twirl approximation , and obtain the logical error rate as a function of the qubit t1 , t2 and state preparation , gate , and readout errors . a numerical monte carlo simulation is performed to obtain the logical error rates and a leading - order analytic formula is derived to estimate their behavior below threshold . our results suggest that scalable fault - tolerant quantum computation should be possible with existing superconducting devices .
