in this paper we improve the layered implementation of arbitrary stabilizer circuits introduced by aaronson and gottesman in phys . rev . a 70(052328 ) , 2004 : to obtain a general stabilizer circuit , we reduce their $ 11$-stage computation -h - c - p - c - p - c - h - p - c - p - c- over the gate set consisting of hadamard , controlled - not , and phase gates , into a $ 7$-stage computation of the form -c - cz - p - h - p - cz - c- . we show arguments in support of using -cz- stages over the -c- stages : not only the use of -cz- stages allows a shorter layered expression , but -cz- stages are simpler and appear to be easier to implement compared to the -c- stages . based on this decomposition , we develop a two - qubit gate depth-$(14n{-}4)$ implementation of stabilizer circuits over the gate library $ \{$h , p , cnot$\}$ , executable in the linear nearest neighbor ( lnn ) architecture , improving best previously known depth-$25n$ circuit , also executable in the lnn architecture . our constructions rely on bruhat decomposition of the symplectic group and on folding arbitrarily long sequences of the form $ ( $ -p - c-$)^m$ into a 3-stage computation -p - cz - c- . our results include the reduction of the $ 11$-stage decomposition -h - c - p - c - p - c - h - p - c - p - c- into a $ 9$-stage decomposition of the form -c - p - c - p - h - c - p - c - p- . this reduction is based on the bruhat decomposition of the symplectic group . this result also implies a new normal form for stabilizer circuits . we show that a circuit in this normal form is optimal in the number of hadamard gates used . we also show that the normal form has an asymptotically optimal number of parameters .
