a challenge for constructing large circuits of superconducting qubits is to balance addressability , coherence and coupling strength . high coherence can be attained by building circuits from fixed - frequency qubits , however , leading techniques can not couple qubits that are far detuned . here we introduce a method based on a tunable bus which allows for the coupling of two fixed - frequency qubits even at large detunings . by parametrically oscillating the bus at the qubit - qubit detuning we enable a resonant exchange ( xx+yy ) interaction . we use this interaction to implement a 183ns two - qubit iswap gate between qubits separated in frequency by 854mhz with a measured average fidelity of 0.9823(4 ) from interleaved randomized benchmarking . this gate may be an enabling technology for surface code circuits and for analog quantum simulation .
