given an arbitrary $ 2^w \times 2^w$ unitary matrix $ u$ , a powerful matrix decomposition can be applied , leading to four different syntheses of a $ w$-qubit quantum circuit performing the unitary transformation . the demonstration is based on a recent theorem by f\"uhr and rzeszotnik , generalizing the scaling of single - bit unitary gates ( $ w=1 $ ) to gates with arbitrary value of~$w$. the synthesized circuit consists of controlled 1-qubit gates , such as negator gates and phasor gates . interestingly , the approach reduces to a known synthesis method for classical logic circuits consisting of controlled not gates , in the case that $ u$ is a permutation matrix .
