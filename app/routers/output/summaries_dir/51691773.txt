quantum self - testing addresses the following question : is it possible to verify the existence of a multipartite state even when one 's measurement devices are completely untrusted ? this problem has seen abundant activity in the last few years , particularly with the advent of parallel self - testing ( i.e. , testing several copies of a state at once ) , which has applications not only to quantum cryptography but also quantum computing . in this work we give the first error - tolerant parallel self - test in a three - party ( rather than two - party ) scenario , by showing that an arbitrary number of copies of the ghz state can be self - tested . in order to handle the additional complexity of a three - party setting , we use a diagrammatic proof based on categorical quantum mechanics , rather than a typical symbolic proof . the diagrammatic approach allows for manipulations of the complicated tensor networks that arise in the proof , and gives a demonstration of the importance of picture - languages in quantum information .
