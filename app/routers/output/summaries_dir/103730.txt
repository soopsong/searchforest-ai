while thousands of experimental physicists and chemists are currently trying to build scalable quantum computers , it appears that simulation of quantum computation will be at least as critical as circuit simulation in classical vlsi design . however , since the work of richard feynman in the early 1980s little progress was made in practical quantum simulation . most researchers focused on polynomial - time simulation of restricted types of quantum circuits that fall short of the full power of quantum computation . simulating quantum computing devices and useful quantum algorithms on classical hardware now requires excessive computational resources , making many important simulation tasks infeasible . in this work we propose a new technique for gate - level simulation of quantum circuits which greatly reduces the difficulty and cost of such simulations . the proposed technique is implemented in a simulation tool called the quantum information decision diagram ( quidd ) and evaluated by simulating grover 's quantum search algorithm . the back - end of our package , quidd pro , is based on binary decision diagrams , well - known for their ability to efficiently represent many seemingly intractable combinatorial structures . this reliance on a well - established area of research allows us to take advantage of existing software for bdd manipulation and achieve unparalleled empirical results for quantum simulation .
