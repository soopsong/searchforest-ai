the line packing problem is concerned with the optimal packing of points in real or complex projective space so that the minimum distance between points is maximized . until recently , all bounds on optimal line packings were known to be derivable from delsarte 's linear program . last year , bukh and cox introduced a new bound for the line packing problem using completely different techniques . in this paper , we use ideas from the bukh -- cox proof to find a new proof of the welch bound , and then we use ideas from delsarte 's linear program to find a new proof of the bukh -- cox bound . hopefully , these unifying principles will lead to further refinements .
