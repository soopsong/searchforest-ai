we investigate schemes to dynamically create many particle entangled states of a two component bose - einstein condensate in a very short time proportional to 1 / n where $ n$ is the number of condensate particles . for small $ n$ we compare exact numerical calculations with analytical semiclassical estimates and find very good agreement for $ n \geq 50$. we also estimate the effect of decoherence on our scheme , study possible scenarios for measuring the entangled states , and investigate experimental imperfections .
