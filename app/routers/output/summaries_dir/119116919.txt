nowadays , quantum router is playing a key role in quantum communication and quantum network- s. here we propose a tunable single - photon routing scheme , based on quantum interference , which uses two distant artificial atoms coupling to two transmission lines . depending on the distance between the two atoms , the collective effect will lead to destructive or constructive interference between the scattered photons . under standing wave condition , single photon from the incident channel can be perfectly transmitted or redirected into another channel by asymmetric or symmet- ric reflected phase shift of atoms , respectively . therefore , we show that our router can be controlled by adjusting the detuning of the atoms and interatomic distance , without any classical field .
