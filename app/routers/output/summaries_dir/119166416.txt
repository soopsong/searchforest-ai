we study the problem of constructing mutually unbiased bases in dimension six . this approach is based on an efficient numerical method designed to find solutions to the quantum state reconstruction problem in finite dimensions . our technique suggests the existence of previously unknown symmetries in karlsson 's non - affine family $ k_6^{(2)}$ which we confirm analytically . also , we obtain strong evidence that no more than three mutually unbiased bases can be constructed from pairs which contain members of some non - affine families of complex hadamard matrices .
