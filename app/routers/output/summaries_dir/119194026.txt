we propose a novel solution for the endpoint of gravitational collapse , in which spacetime ends ( and is orbifolded ) at a microscopic distance from black hole event horizons . this model is motivated by the emergence of singular event horizons in the gravitational aether theory , a semi - classical solution to the cosmological constant problem(s ) , and thus suggests a catastrophic breakdown of general relativity close to black hole event horizons . a similar picture emerges in fuzzball models of black holes in string theory , as well as the recent firewall proposal to resolve the information paradox . we then demonstrate that positing a surface fluid in thermal equilibrium with hawking radiation , with vanishing energy density ( but non - vanishing pressure ) at the new boundary of spacetime , which is required by israel junction conditions , yields a thermodynamic entropy that is identical to the bekenstein - hawking area law , $ s_{bh}$ , for charged rotating black holes . to our knowledge , this is the first derivation of black hole entropy which only employs local thermodynamics . furthermore , a model for the microscopic degrees of freedom of the surface fluid ( which constitute the micro - states of the black hole ) is suggested , which has a finite , but lorentz - violating , quantum field theory . finally , we comment on the effects of physical boundary on hawking radiation , and show that relaxing the assumption of equilibrium with hawking radiation sets $ s_{bh}$ as an upper limit for black hole entropy .
