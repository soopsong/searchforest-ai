we study quench dynamics in the many - body hilbert space using two isolated systems with a finite number of interacting particles : a paradigmatic model of randomly interacting bosons and a dynamical ( clean ) model of interacting spins-$1/2$. for both systems in the region of strong quantum chaos , the number of components of the evolving wave function , defined through the number of principal components $ n_{pc}$ ( or participation ratio ) , was recently found to increase exponentially fast in time [ phys . rev . e 99 , 010101r ( 2019 ) ] . here , we ask whether the out - of - time ordered correlator ( otoc ) , which is nowadays widely used to quantify instability in quantum systems , can manifest analogous time - dependence . we show that $ n_{pc}$ can be formally expressed as the inverse of the sum of all otoc 's for projection operators . while none of the individual projection - otoc 's shows an exponential behavior , their sum decreases exponentially fast in time . the comparison between the behavior of the otoc with that of the $ n_{pc}$ helps us better understand wave packet dynamics in the many - body hilbert space , in close connection with the problems of thermalization and information scrambling .
