we propose two schemes for concentration of hyperentanglement of nonlocal multipartite states which are simultaneously entangled in the polarization and spatial modes . one scheme uses an auxiliary singlephoton state prepared according to the parameters of the less - entangled states . the other scheme uses two less - entangled states with unknown parameters to distill the maximal hyperentanglement . the procrustean concentration is realized by two parity check measurements in both the two degrees of freedom . nondestructive quantum nondemolition detectors based on cross - kerr nonlinearity are used to implement the parity check , which makes the unsuccessful instances reusable in the next concentration round . the success probabilities in both schemes can be made to approach unity by iteration . moreover , in both schemes only one of the n parties has to perform the parity check measurements . our schemes are efficient and useful for quantum information processing involving hyperentanglement .
