we present a family of extensions of spherically symmetric einstein - lanczos - lovelock gravity . the field equations are second order and obey a generalized birkhoff 's theorem . the hamiltonian constraint can be written in terms of a generalized misner - sharp mass function that determines the form of the vacuum solution . the action can be designed to yield interesting non - singular black - hole spacetimes as the unique vacuum solutions , including the hayward black hole as well as a completely new one . the new theories therefore provide a consistent starting point for studying the formation and evaporation of non - singular black holes as a possible resolution to the black hole information loss conundrum .
