we propose a scheme with dc - control of finite bandwidth to implement two - qubit gate for superconducting flux qubits at the optimal point . we provide a detailed non - perturbative analysis on the dynamic evolution of the qubits interacting with a common quantum bus . an effective qubit - qubit coupling is induced while decoupling the quantum bus with proposed pulse sequences . the two - qubit gate is insensitive to the initial state of the quantum bus and applicable to non - perturbative coupling regime which enables rapid two - qubit operation . this scheme can be scaled up to multi - qubit coupling .
