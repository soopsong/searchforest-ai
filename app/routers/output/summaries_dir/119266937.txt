we advance a holographic conjecture for the entanglement negativity of bipartite quantum states in $ ( 1 + 1)$-dimensional conformal field theories in the $ ads_3 / cft_2 $ framework . our conjecture exactly reproduces the replica technique results in the large central charge limit , for both the pure state described by the $ cft_{1 + 1}$ vacuum dual to bulk the pure $ ads_3 $ geometry and the finite temperature mixed state dual to a euclidean btz black hole respectively . the holographic entanglement negativity characterizes the distillable entanglement and reduces to a specific sum of holographic mutual informations . we briefly allude to a possible higher dimensional generalization of our conjecture in a generic $ ads_{d+1}/cft_{d}$ scenario .
