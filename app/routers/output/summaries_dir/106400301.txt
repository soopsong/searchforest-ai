quantum channels , which are completely positive and trace preserving mappings , can alter the dimension of a system ; e.g. , a quantum channel from a qubit to a qutrit . we study the convex set properties of dimension - altering quantum channels , and particularly the channel decomposition problem in terms of convex sum of extreme channels . we provide various quantum circuit representations of extreme and generalized extreme channels , which can be employed in an optimization to approximately decompose an arbitrary channel . numerical simulations of low - dimensional channels are performed to demonstrate our channel decomposition scheme .
