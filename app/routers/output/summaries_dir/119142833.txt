the lohe matrix model is a continuous - time dynamical system describing the collective dynamics of group elements in the unitary group manifold , and it has been introduced as a toy model of a non abelian generalization of the kuramoto phase model . in the absence of couplings , it reduces to the finite - dimensional decoupled free schr\"{o}dinger equations with constant hamiltonians . in this paper , we study a rigorous mean - field limit of the lohe matrix model which results in a vlasov type equation for the probability density function on the corresponding phase space . we also provide two different settings for the emergent synchronous dynamics of the kinetic lohe equation in terms of the initial data and the coupling strength .
