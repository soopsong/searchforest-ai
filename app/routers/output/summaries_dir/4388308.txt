a deterministic photon - photon quantum - logic gate is a long - standing goal . building such a gate becomes possible if a light pulse containing only one photon imprints a phase shift of $ \pi$ onto another light field . here we experimentally demonstrate the generation of such a $ \pi$ phase shift with a single - photon pulse . a first light pulse containing less than one photon on average is stored in an atomic gas . rydberg blockade combined with electromagnetically induced transparency creates a phase shift for a second light pulse which propagates through the medium . postselected on the detection of a retrieved photon from the first pulse , we measure a $ \pi$ phase shift of the second pulse . this demonstrates a crucial step toward a photon - photon gate and offers a variety of applications in the field of quantum information processing .
