we investigate how the entanglement properties of a two - mode state can be improved by performing a coherent superposition operation of photon subtraction and addition , proposed by lee and nha [ phys . rev . a 82 , 053812 ( 2010 ) ] , on each mode . we show that the degree of entanglement , the epr - type correlation , and the performance of quantum teleportation can be all enhanced for the output state when the coherent operation is applied to a two - mode squeezed state . the effects of the coherent operation are more prominent than those of the mere photon subtraction and the addition particularly in the small squeezing regime , whereas the optimal operation becomes the photon subtraction in the large - squeezing regime .
