due to the decoherence of the state - of - the - art physical implementations of quantum computers , it is essential to parallelize the quantum circuits to reduce their depth . two decades ago , moore et al . demonstrated that additional qubits ( or ancillae ) could be used to design"shallow"parallel circuits for quantum operators . they proved that any $ n$-qubit cnot circuit could be parallelized to $ o(\log n)$ depth , with $ o(n^2)$ ancillae . however , the near - term quantum technologies can only support limited amount of qubits , making space - depth trade - off a fundamental research subject for quantum - circuit synthesis . in this work , we establish an asymptotically optimal space - depth trade - off for the design of cnot circuits . we prove that for any $ m\geq0 $ , any $ n$-qubit cnot circuit can be parallelized to $ o\left(\max \left\{\log n , \frac{n^{2}}{(n+m)\log ( n+m)}\right\ } \right)$ depth , with $ o(m)$ ancillae . we show that this bound is tight by a counting argument , and further show that even with arbitrary two - qubit quantum gates to approximate cnot circuits , the depth lower bound still meets our construction , illustrating the robustness of our result . our work improves upon two previous results , one by moore et al . for $ o(\log n)$-depth quantum synthesis , and one by patel et al . for $ m = 0 $ : for the former , we reduce the need of ancillae by a factor of $ \log^2 n$ by showing that $ m = o(n^2/\log^2 n)$ additional qubits suffice to build $ o(\log n)$-depth , $ o(n^2/\log n)$ size --- which is asymptotically optimal --- cnot circuits ; for the later , we reduce the depth by a factor of $ n$ to the asymptotically optimal bound $ o(n/\log n)$. our results can be directly extended to stabilizer circuits using an earlier result by aaronson et al . in addition , we provide relevant hardness evidences for synthesis optimization of cnot circuits in term of both size and depth .
