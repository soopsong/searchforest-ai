the coding space in quantum communication could be expanded to high - dimensional space by using orbital angular momentum ( oam ) states of photons , as both the capacity of the channel and security are enhanced . here we present a novel approach to realize high - capacity quantum key distribution ( qkd ) by exploiting oam states . the innovation of the proposed approach relies on a unique type of entangledphoton source which produces entangled photons with oam randomly distributed among high order fiboncci - like numbers and a new physical mechanism for efficiently sharing keys . this combination of entanglement with mathematical properties of high order fibonacci sequences provides the qkd protocol which is immune to photon - number - splitting attacks and allows secure generation of long keys from few photons . unlike other protocols , reference frame alignment and active modulation of production and detection bases are unnecessary .
