measuring the quantum dynamics of a mechanical system , when few phonons are involved , remains a challenge . we show that a superconducting microwave resonator linearly coupled to the mechanical mode constitutes a very powerful probe for this scope . this new coupling can be much stronger than the usual radiation pressure interaction by adjusting a gate voltage . we focus on the detection of phonon blockade , showing that it can be observed by measuring the statistics of the light in the cavity . the underlying reason is the formation of an entangled state between the two resonators . our scheme realizes a phonotonic josephson junction , giving rise to coherent oscillations between phonons and photons as well as a self - trapping regime for a coupling smaller than a critical value . the transition from the self - trapping to the oscillating regime is also induced dynamically by dissipation .
