many quantum key distribution ( qkd ) schemes are based on sending and measuring qubits -- two - dimensional quantum systems . yet , in practical realizations and experiments , the measuring devices at the receiver 's ( bob ) site commonly do not measure a two - dimensional system but rather a quantum space of a larger dimension . such an enlargement sometimes results from imperfect devices . however , in various qkd protocols such enlargement exists even in the ideal scenario when all devices are assumed to be perfect . this issue is common , for instance , in qkd schemes implemented via photons , where the parties ' devices are based on mach - zehnder interferometers , as these inherently enlarge the quantum space in use . we show how space enlargement at bob 's site exposes the implemented protocol to new kinds of attacks , attacks that have not yet been explicitly pinpointed nor rigorously analyzed . we name these the"reversed space attacks " . a key insight in formalizing our attacks , is the idea of taking all states defining bob 's ( large ) measured space and reversing them in time in order to identify precisely the space that an eavesdropper may attack . we employ such attacks on two variants of intereferometric - based qkd recently experimented by several groups , and show how to get full information on the qubit sent by alice , while inducing no errors at all . the technique we develop here has subsequently been used in a closely related work ( boyer , gelles , and mor , physical review a , 2014 ) to demonstrate a ( weaker variant of ) reversed - space attack on both interferometric - based and polarization - based qkd .
