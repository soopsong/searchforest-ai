quantum entanglement is the key resource for quantum information processing . device - independent certification of entangled states is a long standing open question , which arouses the concept of self - testing . the central aim of self - testing is to certify the state and measurements of quantum systems without any knowledge of their inner workings , even when the used devices can not be trusted . specifically , utilizing bell 's theorem , it is possible to place a boundary on the singlet fidelity of entangled qubits . here , beyond this rough estimation , we experimentally demonstrate a complete self - testing process for various pure bipartite entangled states up to four dimensions , by simply inspecting the correlations of the measurement outcomes . we show that this self - testing process can certify the exact form of entangled states with fidelities higher than 99.9 % for all the investigated scenarios , which indicates the superior completeness and robustness of this method . our work promotes self - testing as a practical tool for developing quantum techniques .
