using the kubo formalism , we demonstrate fractional quantum hall features in a rotating bose - einstein condensate in a co - rotating two - dimensional optical lattice . the co - rotating lattice and trap potential allow for an effective magnetic field and compensation of the centrifugal potential . fractional quantum hall features are seen for the single - particle system and for few strongly interacting many - particle systems .
