we present , and analyze thoroughly , a highly symmetric and efficient scheme for the determination of a single - qubit state , such as the polarization properties of photons emitted by a single - photon source . in our scheme there are only four measured probabilities , just enough for the determination of the three parameters that specify the qubit state , whereas the standard procedure would measure six probabilities .
