we present an experimental feasible scheme to synthesize two - mode continuous - variable entangled states of two superconducting resonators that are interconnected by two gap - tunable superconducting qubits . we show that , with each artificial atom suitably driven by a bichromatic microwave field to induce sidebands in the qubit - resonator coupling , the stationary state of the photon fields in the two resonators can be cooled and steered into a two - mode squeezed vacuum state via a dissipative quantum dynamical process , while the superconducting qubits remain in their ground states . in this scheme the qubit decay plays a positive role and can help drive the system to the target state , which thus converts a detrimental source of noise into a resource .
