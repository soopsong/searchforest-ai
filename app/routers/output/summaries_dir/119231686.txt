protocols used in quantum information and precision spectroscopy rely on efficient internal quantum state discrimination . with a single ion in a linear paul trap , we implement a novel detection method which utilizes correlations between two detection events with an intermediate spin - flip . the technique is experimentally characterized as more robust against fluctuations in detection laser power compared to conventionally implemented methods . furthermore , systematic detection errors which limit the rabi oscillation contrast in conventional methods are overcome .
