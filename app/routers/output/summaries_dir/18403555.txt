emerging technologies with asymptotic zero power dissipation , such as quantum computing , require the logical operations to be done in a reversible manner . in recent years , the problem of synthesizing boolean functions in the reversible logic domain has gained significant research attention . the efficiency of the synthesis methods is measured in terms of quantum cost , gate cost , garbage lines , logic depth and speed of synthesis . in this paper , we present an approach based on exclusive sum - of - products ( esop ) , which allows the user to explore the trade - off between quantum cost and garbage lines . the proposed technique adds a new dimension to the reversible logic synthesis solutions . we demonstrate by detailed experiments that controlled improvement in quantum cost and gate count by increasing garbage count can be achieved . in some cases , improved quantum cost and gate count compared to state - of - the - art synthesis methods are reported . furthermore , we propose a novel rule - based approach to achieve ancilla - free reversible logic synthesis starting from an esop formulation .
