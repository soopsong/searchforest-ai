constructing an ontology for quantum theory is challenging , in part due to unavoidable measurement back - action . the aharonov - albert - vaidman weak measurement formalism provides a method to predict measurement results ( weak values ) in a regime where back - action is negligible . the weak value appears analogous to a classical conditional mean and in fact , has a number of features that further suggest it may be interpreted as being related to some underlying ontological model . however , the ontology appears bizarre since the weak values are complex and unbounded . here , we study weak values in the context of a recent quantum optical experiment involving two - photon interactions . the results of the experiment are reinterpreted within a ' stochastic optics ' model of light . the model is based on standard ( maxwell ) electromagnetic theory , supplemented by stochastic fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields . we show that the conditional means of the electric field intensities correspond to the experimentally observed weak values . this is a provocative result , as it suggests that at least within this experiment , the weak value gives us information about the average of an ontological quantity ( the intensity ) . we study the breakdown of the stochastic optics model , which occurs outside the experimentally probed regime , and in particular in the limit where the weak value predicts ' anomalous ' results .
