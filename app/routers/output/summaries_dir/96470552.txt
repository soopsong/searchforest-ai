necessary and sufficient conditions for bipartite entanglement are derived , which apply to arbitrary hilbert spaces . motivated by the concept of witnesses , optimized entanglement inequalities are formulated solely in terms of arbitrary hermitian operators , which makes them useful for applications in experiments . the needed optimization procedure is based on a separability eigenvalue problem , whose analytical solutions are derived for a special class of projection operators . for general hermitian operators , a numerical implementation of entanglement tests is proposed . it is also shown how to identify bound entangled states with positive partial transposition .
