we study quantum measurement with preselection and postselection , and derive the precise expressions of the measurement results without any restriction on the coupling strength between the system and the measuring device . for a qubit system , we derive the maximum pointer shifts by choosing appropriate initial and finial states . a significant amplification effect is obtained when the interaction between the system and the measuring device is very weak , and typical ideal quantum measurement results are obtained when the interaction is strong . the improvement of the signal - tonoise ratio ( snr ) and the enhancement of the measurement sensitivity ( ms ) by weak measurements are studied . without considering the probability decrease due to postselection , the snr and the ms can be both significantly improved by weak measurements ; however , neither snr nor ms can be effectively improved when the probability decrease is considered .
