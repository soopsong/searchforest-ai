we provide generalized entanglement constraints in multi - qubit systems in terms of tsallis entropy . using quantum tsallis entropy of order $ q$ , we first provide a generalized monogamy inequality of multi - qubit entanglement for $ q=2 $ or $ 3$. this generalization encapsulates multi - qubit ckw - type inequality as a special case . we further provide a generalized polygamy inequality of multi - qubit entanglement in terms of tsallis-$q$ entropy for $ 1 \leq q \leq2 $ or $ 3 \leq q \leq 4 $ , which also contains the multi - qubit polygamy inequality as a special case .
