we investigate a method for entangling two singlet - triplet qubits in adjacent double quantum dots via capacitive interactions . in contrast to prior work , here we focus on a regime with strong interactions between the qubits . the interplay of the interaction energy and simultaneous large detunings for both double dots gives rise to the double charge resonant regime , in which the unpolarized ( 1111 ) and fully polarized ( 0202 ) four - electron states in the absence of interqubit tunneling are near degeneracy , while being energetically well - separated from the partially polarized ( 0211 and 1102 ) states . a rapid controlled - phase gate may be realized by combining time evolution in this regime in the presence of intraqubit tunneling and the interqubit coulomb interaction with refocusing $ { \pi}$ pulses that swap the singly occupied singlet and triplet states of the two qubits via , e.g. , magnetic gradients . we calculate the fidelity of this entangling gate , incorporating models for two types of noise -- charge fluctuations in the single - qubit detunings and charge relaxation within the low - energy subspace via electron - phonon interaction -- and identify parameter regimes that optimize the fidelity . the rates of phonon - induced decay for pairs of gaas or si double quantum dots vary with the sizes of the dipolar and quadrupolar contributions and are several orders of magnitude smaller for si , leading to high theoretical gate fidelities for coupled singlet - triplet qubits in si dots . we also consider the dependence of the capacitive coupling on the relative orientation of the double dots and find that a linear geometry provides the fastest potential gate .
