a revised version of the massively parallel simulator of a universal quantum computer , described in this journal eleven years ago , is used to benchmark various gate - based quantum algorithms on some of the most powerful supercomputers that exist today . adaptive encoding of the wave function reduces the memory requirement by a factor of eight , making it possible to simulate universal quantum computers with up to 48 qubits on the sunway taihulight and on the k computer . the simulator exhibits close - to - ideal weak - scaling behavior on the sunway taihulight , on the k computer , on an ibm blue gene / q , and on intel xeon based clusters , implying that the combination of parallelization and hardware can track the exponential scaling due to the increasing number of qubits . results of executing simple quantum circuits and shor 's factorization algorithm on quantum computers containing up to 48 qubits are presented .
