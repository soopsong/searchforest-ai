microwave photons inside lattices of coupled resonators and superconducting qubits can exhibit surprising matter - like behavior . realizing such open - system quantum simulators presents an experimental challenge and requires new tools and measurement techniques . here , we introduce scanning defect microscopy as one such tool and illustrate its use in mapping the normal - mode structure of microwave photons inside a 49-site kagome lattice of coplanar waveguide resonators . scanning is accomplished by moving a probe equipped with a sapphire tip across the lattice . this locally perturbs resonator frequencies and induces shifts of the lattice resonance frequencies which we determine by measuring the transmission spectrum . from the magnitude of mode shifts we can reconstruct photon field amplitudes at each lattice site and thus create spatial images of the photon - lattice normal modes .
