single - photon subtraction plays important roles in optical quantum information processing as it provides a non - gaussian characteristic in continuous - variable quantum information . while the conventional way of implementing single - photon subtraction based on a low - reflectance beam splitter works properly for a single - mode quantum state , it is unsuitable for a multimode quantum state because a single photon is subtracted from all multiple modes without maintaining their mode coherence . here we experimentally implement and characterize a mode - tunable coherent single - photon subtractor based on sum frequency generation . it can subtract a single photon exclusively from one desired time - frequency mode of light or from a coherent superposition of multiple time - frequency modes . to fully characterize the implemented single - photon subtractions , we employ quantum process tomography based on coherent states . the mode - tunable coherent single - photon subtractor will be an essential element for realizing non - gaussian quantum networks necessary to get a quantum advantage in information processing .
