the schr\"odinger - newton equation has gained attention in the recent past as a nonlinear modification of the schr\"odinger equation due to a gravitational self - interaction . such a modification is expected from a fundamentally semi - classical theory of gravity , and can therefore be considered a test case for the necessity of the quantisation of the gravitational field . here we provide a thorough study of the effects of the schr\"odinger - newton equation for a micron - sized sphere trapped in a harmonic oscillator potential . we discuss both the effect on the energy eigenstates and the dynamical behaviour of squeezed states , covering the experimentally relevant parameter regimes .
