in laboratory experiments we demonstrate that protoplasmic tubes of acellular slime mould \emph{physarum polycephalum } show current versus voltage profiles consistent with memristive systems and that the effect is due to the living protoplasm of the mould . this complements previous findings on memristive properties of other living systems ( human skin and blood ) and contributes to development of self - growing bio - electronic circuits . distinctive asymmetric $ v$-$i$ curves which were occasionally observed when the internal current is on the same order as the driven current , are well - modelled by the concept of active memristors .
