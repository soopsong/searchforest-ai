we propose a scheme for preparation of large - scale entangled $ ghz$ states and $ w$ states with neutral rydberg atoms . the scheme mainly depends on rydberg antiblockade effect , i.e. , as the rydberg - rydberg - interaction ( rri ) strength and the detuning between the atom transition frequency and the classical laser frequency satisfies some certain conditions , the effective rabi oscillation between the two ground states and the two excitation rydberg states would be generated . the prominent advantage is that both two - multiparticle $ ghz$ states and two - multiparticle $ w$ states can be fused in this model , especially the success probability for fusion of $ ghz$ states can reach unit . in addition , the imperfections induced by the spontaneous emission is also discussed through numerical simulation .
