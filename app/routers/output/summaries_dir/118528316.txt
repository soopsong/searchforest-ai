in spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) based quantum information processing ( qip ) experiments , there is a tradeoff between the coincide count rates ( i.e. the pumping power of the spdc ) , which limits the rate of the protocol , and the visibility of the quantum interference , which limits the quality of the protocol . this tradeoff is mainly caused by the multi - photon pair emissions from the spdcs . in theory , the problem is how to model the experiments without truncating these multi - photon emissions while including practical imperfections . in this paper , we establish a method to theoretically simulate spdc based qips which fully incorporates the effect of multi - photon emissions and various practical imperfections . the key ingredient in our method is the application of the characteristic function formalism which has been used in continuous variable qips . we apply our method to three examples , the hong - ou - mandel interference and the einstein - podolsky - rosen interference experiments , and the concatenated entanglement swapping protocol . for the first two examples , we show that our theoretical results quantitatively agree with the recent experimental results . also we provide the closed expressions for these the interference visibilities with the full multi - photon components and various imperfections . for the last example , we provide the general theoretical form of the concatenated entanglement swapping protocol in our method and show the numerical results up to 5 concatenations . our method requires only a small computation resource ( few minutes by a commercially available computer ) which was not possible by the previous theoretical approach . our method will have applications in a wide range of spdc based qip protocols with high accuracy and a reasonable computation resource .
