we present a quantum algorithm for combinatorial optimization using the cost structure of the search states . its behavior is illustrated for overconstrained satisfiability and asymmetric traveling salesman problems . simulations with randomly generated problem instances show each step of the algorithm shifts amplitude preferentially towards lower cost states , thereby concentrating amplitudes into low - cost states , on average . these results are compared with conventional heuristics for these problems .
