we derive simple models for the dynamics of a single atom coupled to a cavity field mode in the absorptive bistable parameter regime by projecting the time evolution of the state of the system onto a suitably chosen nonlinear low - dimensional manifold , which is found by use of local tangent space alignment . the output field from the cavity is detected with a homodyne detector allowing observation of quantum jumps of the system between states with different average numbers of photons in the cavity . we find that the models , which are significantly faster to integrate numerically than the full stochastic master equation , largely reproduce the dynamics of the system , and we demonstrate that they are sufficiently accurate to facilitate feedback control of the state of the system based on the predictions of the models alone .
