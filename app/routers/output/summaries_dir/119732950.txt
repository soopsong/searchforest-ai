we prove spatial decay estimates on disorder - averaged position - momentum correlations in a gapless class of random oscillator models . first , we prove a decay estimate on dynamic correlations for general eigenstates with a bound that depends on the magnitude of the maximally excited mode . then , we consider the situation of a quantum quench . we prove that the full time - evolution of an initially chosen ( uncorrelated ) product state has disorder - averaged correlations which decay exponentially in space , uniformly in time .
