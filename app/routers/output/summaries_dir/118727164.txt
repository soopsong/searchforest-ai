we study the continuous - time quantum walks on graphs in the adjacency algebra of the $ n$-cube and its related distance regular graphs . for $ k\geq 2 $ , we find graphs in the adjacency algebra of $ ( 2^{k+2}-8)$-cube that admit instantaneous uniform mixing at time $ \pi/2^k$ and graphs that have perfect state transfer at time $ \pi/2^k$. we characterize the folded $ n$-cubes , the halved $ n$-cubes and the folded halved $ n$-cubes whose adjacency algebra contains a complex hadamard matrix . we obtain the same conditions for the characterization of these graphs admitting instantaneous uniform mixing .
