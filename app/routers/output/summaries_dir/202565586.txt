solving linear systems of equations is central to many engineering and scientific fields . several quantum algorithms have been proposed for linear systems , where the goal is to prepare $ |x\rangle$ such that $ a|x\rangle \propto |b\rangle$. while these algorithms are promising , the time horizon for their implementation is long due to the required quantum circuit depth . in this work , we propose a variational hybrid quantum - classical algorithm for solving linear systems , with the aim of reducing the circuit depth and doing much of the computation classically . we propose a cost function based on the overlap between $ |b\rangle$ and $ a|x\rangle$ , and we derive an operational meaning for this cost in terms of the solution precision $ \epsilon$. we also introduce a quantum circuit to estimate this cost , while showing that this cost can not be efficiently estimated classically . using rigetti 's quantum computer , we successfully implement our algorithm up to a problem size of $ 32 \times 32$. furthermore , we numerically find that the complexity of our algorithm scales efficiently in both $ 1/\epsilon$ and $ \kappa$ , with $ \kappa$ the condition number of $ a$. our algorithm provides a heuristic for quantum linear systems that could make this application more near term .
