quantum error correction is important to quantum information processing , which allows us to reliably process information encoded in quantum error correction codes . efficient quantum error correction benefits from the knowledge of error rates . we propose a protocol for monitoring error rates in real time without interrupting the quantum error correction . any adaptation of the quantum error correction code or its implementation circuit is not required . the protocol can be directly applied to the most advanced quantum error correction techniques , e.g. surface code . a gaussian processes algorithm is used to estimate and predict error rates based on error correction data in the past . we find that using these estimated error rates , the probability of error correction failures can be significantly reduced by a factor increasing with the code distance .
