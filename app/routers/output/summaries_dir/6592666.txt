the first - order , infinite - component field equations we proposed before for non - relativistic anyons ( identified with particles in the plane with noncommuting coordinates ) are generalized to accommodate arbitrary background electromagnetic fields . consistent coupling of the underlying classical system to arbitrary fields is introduced ; at a critical value of the magnetic field , the particle follows a hall - like law of motion . the corresponding quantized system reveals a hidden nonlocality if the magnetic field is inhomogeneous . in the quantum landau problem spectral as well as state structure ( finite vs. infinite ) asymmetry is found . the bound and scattering states , separated by the critical magnetic field phase , behave as further , distinct phases .
