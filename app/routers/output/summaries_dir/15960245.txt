we describe how randomized benchmarking can be used to reconstruct the unital part of any trace - preserving quantum map , which in turn is sufficient for the full characterization of any unitary evolution , or more generally , any unital trace - preserving evolution . this approach inherits randomized benchmarking 's robustness to preparation , measurement , and gate imperfections , therefore avoiding systematic errors caused by these imperfections . we also extend these techniques to efficiently estimate the average fidelity of a quantum map to unitary maps outside of the clifford group . the unitaries we consider correspond to large circuits commonly used as building blocks to achieve scalable , universal , and fault - tolerant quantum computation . hence , we can efficiently verify all such subcomponents of a circuit - based universal quantum computer . in addition , we rigorously bound the time and sampling complexities of randomized benchmarking procedures , proving that the required non - linear estimation problem can be solved efficiently .
