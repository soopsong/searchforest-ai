quantum computation strongly relies on the realisation , manipulation and control of qubits . a central method for realizing qubits is by creating a double - well potential system with a significant gap between the first two eigenvalues and the rest . in this work we first revisit the theoretical grounds underlying the double - well qubit dynamics , then proceed to suggest novel extensions of these principles to a triple - well qutrit with periodic boundary conditions , followed by a general d - well analysis of qudits . these analyses are based on representations of the special unitary groups su(d ) which expose the systems ' symmetry and employ them for performing computations . we conclude with a few notes on coherence and scalability of d - well systems .
