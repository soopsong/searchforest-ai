in this paper we derive an extra class of non - markovian master equations where the system state is written as a sum of auxiliary matrixes whose evolution involve lindblad contributions with local coupling between all of them , resembling the structure of a classical rate equation . the system dynamics may develops strong non - local effects such as the dependence of the stationary properties with the system initialization . these equations are derived from alternative microscopic interactions , such as complex environments described in a generalized born - markov approximation and tripartite system - environment interactions , where extra unobserved degrees of freedom mediates the entanglement between the system and a markovian reservoir . conditions that guarantees the completely positive condition of the solution map are found . quantum stochastic processes that recover the system dynamics in average are formulated . we exemplify our results by analyzing the dynamical action of non - trivial structured dephasing and depolarizing reservoirs over a single qubit .
