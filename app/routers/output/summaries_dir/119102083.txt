we focus on a hidden markovian process whose internal hidden system is given as a quantum system , and we address a sequence of data obtained from this process . using a quantum version of the perron - frobenius theorem , we derive novel upper and lower bounds for the cumulant generating function of the sample mean of the data . using these bound , we derive the central limit theorem and large and moderate deviations for the tail probability . then , we give the asymptotic variance is given by using the second derivative of the cumulant generating function . we also derive another expression for the asymptotic variance by considering the quantum version of fundamental matrix . further , we explain how to extend our results to a general probabilistic system .
