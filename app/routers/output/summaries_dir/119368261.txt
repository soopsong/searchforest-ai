cooling the qubit into a pure initial state is crucial for realizing fault - tolerant quantum information processing . here we envisage a star - topology arrangement of reset and computation qubits for this purpose . the reset qubits cool or purify the computation qubit by transferring its entropy to a heat - bath with the help of a heat - bath algorithmic cooling procedure . by combining standard nmr methods with powerful quantum control techniques , we cool central qubits of two large star topology systems , with 13 and 37 spins respectively . we obtain polarization enhancements by a factor of over 24 , and an associated reduction in the spin temperature from 298 k down to 12 k. exploiting the enhanced polarization of computation qubit , we prepare combination - coherences of orders up to 15 . by benchmarking the decay of these coherences we investigate the underlying noise process . further , we also cool a pair of computation qubits and subsequently prepare them in an effective pure - state .
