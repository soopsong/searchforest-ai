in this paper , we discuss biological effects of electromagnetic ( em ) fields in the context of cancer biology . in particular , we review the nanomechanical properties of microtubules ( mts ) , the latter being one of the most successful targets for cancer therapy . we propose an investigation on the coupling of electromagnetic radiation to mechanical vibrations of mts as an important basis for biological and medical applications . in our opinion optomechanical methods can accurately monitor and control the mechanical properties of isolated mts in a liquid environment . consequently , studying nanomechanical properties of mts may give useful information for future applications to diagnostic and therapeutic technologies involving non - invasive externally applied physical fields . for example , electromagnetic fields or high intensity ultrasound can be used therapeutically avoiding harmful side effects of chemotherapeutic agents or classical radiation therapy .
