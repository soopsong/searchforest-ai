we analyze multipartite entanglement between atomic ensembles within quantum matter - light interfaces . in our proposal , a polarized light beam crosses sequentially several polarized atomic ensembles impinging on each of them at a given angle \alpha_i . these angles are crucial parameters for shaping the entanglement since they are directly connected to the appropriate combinations of the collective atomic spins that are squeezed . we exploit such scheme to go beyond the pure state paradigm proposing realistic experimental settings to address multipartite mixed state entanglement in continuous variables .
