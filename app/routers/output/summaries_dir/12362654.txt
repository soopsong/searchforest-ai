recently , a large class of quantum non - markovian piecewise dynamics for an open quantum system obeying closed evolution equations has been introduced [ b. vacchini , phys . rev . lett . 117 , 230401 ( 2016 ) ] . these dynamics have been defined in terms of a waiting - time distribution between quantum jumps , along with quantum maps describing the effect of jumps and the system 's evolution between them . here , we present a quantum collision model with memory , whose reduced dynamics in the continuous - time limit reproduces the above class of non - markovian piecewise dynamics , thus providing an explicit microscopic realization .
