we present a scheme able to protect k>= 3 qubits of information against the occurrence of multiple erasures , based on the code proposed by yang et al . ( 2004 jetp letters 79 236 ) . in this scheme redundant blocks are used and we restrict to the case that each erasure must occur in distinct blocks . we explicitly characterize the encoding operation and the restoring operation required to implement this scheme . the operators used in these operations can be adjusted to construct different quantum erasure - correcting codes . a special feature of this scheme is that no measurement is required . to illustrate our scheme , we present an example in which five - qubits of information are protected against the occurrence of two erasures .
