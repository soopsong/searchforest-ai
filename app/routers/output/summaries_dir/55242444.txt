quantum states may exhibit asymmetry with respect to the action of a given group . such an asymmetry of states can be considered as a resource in applications such as quantum metrology , and it is a concept that encompasses quantum coherence as a special case . we introduce explicitly and study the robustness of asymmetry , a quantifier of asymmetry of states that we prove to have many attractive properties , including efficient numerical computability via semidefinite programming , and an operational interpretation in a channel discrimination context . we also introduce the notion of asymmetry witnesses , whose measurement in a laboratory detects the presence of asymmetry . we prove that properly constrained asymmetry witnesses provide lower bounds to the robustness of asymmetry , which is shown to be a directly measurable quantity itself . we then focus our attention on coherence witnesses and the robustness of coherence , for which we prove a number of additional results ; these include an analysis of its specific relevance in phase discrimination and quantum metrology , an analytical calculation of its value for a relevant class of quantum states , and tight bounds that relate it to another previously defined coherence monotone .
