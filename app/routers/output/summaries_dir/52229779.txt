einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) steering allows two parties to verify their entanglement , even if one party 's measurements are untrusted . this concept has not only provided new insights into the nature of non - local spatial correlations in quantum mechanics , but also serves as a resource for one - sided device - independent quantum information tasks . here , we investigate how epr steering behaves when one - half of a maximally - entangled pair of qudits ( multidimensional quantum systems ) is cloned by a universal cloning machine . we find that epr steering , as verified by a criterion based on the mutual information between qudits , can only be found in one of the copy subsystems but not both . we prove that this is also true for the single - system analogue of epr steering . we find that this restriction , which we term"no - cloning of quantum steering " , elucidates the physical reason why steering can be used to secure sources and channels against cloning - based attacks when implementing quantum communication and quantum computation protocols .
