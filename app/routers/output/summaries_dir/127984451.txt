we report generation and measurement of a squeezed vacuum from a semi - monolithic fabry - perot optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) up to 100 mhz at 1550 nm . the output coupler of the opo is a flat surface of a nonlinear crystal with partially reflecting coating , which enables direct coupling with waveguide modules . using the opo , we observed 6.2db of squeezing at 2 mhz and 3.0 db of squeezing at 100 mhz . the opo operates at the optimal wavelength to minimize propagation losses in silica waveguides and looks towards solving a bottleneck of downsizing these experiments : that of coupling between a squeezer and a waveguide .
