it is shown that a $ n\times n$ real symmetric [ complex hermitian ] positive definite matrix $ v$ is congruent to a diagonal matrix modulo a pseudo - orthogonal [ pseudo - unitary ] matrix in $ so(m , n)$ [ $ su(m , n)$ ] , for any choice of partition $ n = m+n$. it is further shown that the method of proof in this context can easily be adapted to obtain a rather simple proof of williamson 's theorem which states that if $ n$ is even then $ v$ is congruent also to a diagonal matrix modulo a symplectic matrix in $ sp(n,{\cal r})$ [ $ sp(n,{\cal c})$ ] . applications of these results considered include a generalization of the schweinler - wigner method of ` orthogonalization based on an extremum principle ' to construct pseudo - orthogonal and symplectic bases from a given set of linearly independent vectors .
