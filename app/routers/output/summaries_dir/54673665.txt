the conflict between classical and quantum physics can be identified through a series of yes - no tests on quantum systems , without it being necessary that these systems be in special quantum states . kochen - specker ( ks ) sets of yes - no tests have this property and provide a quantum - versus - classical advantage that is free of the initialization problem that affects some quantum computers . here , we report the first experimental implementation of a complete ks set that consists of 18 yes - no tests on four - dimensional quantum systems and show how to use the ks set to obtain a state - independent quantum advantage . we first demonstrate the unique power of this ks set for solving a task while avoiding the problem of state initialization . such a demonstration is done by showing that , for 28 different quantum states encoded in the orbital - angular - momentum and polarization degrees of freedom of single photons , the ks set provides an impossible - to - beat solution . in a second experiment , we generate maximally contextual quantum correlations by performing compatible sequential measurements of the polarization and path of single photons . in this case , state independence is demonstrated for 15 different initial states . maximum contextuality and state independence follow from the fact that the sequences of measurements project any initial quantum state onto one of the ks set 's eigenstates . our results show that ks sets can be used for quantum - information processing and quantum computation and pave the way for future developments .
