we show theoretically that multipartite entanglement is generated on a massive scale in the spectrum , or optical frequency comb , of a single optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) emitting well above threshold . in this system , the quantum dynamics of the strongly depleted pump field are responsible for the onset of the entanglement by correlating the two - mode squeezed , bipartite - entangled pairs of opo signal fields . ( such pairs are independent of one another in the undepleted , classical pump approximation . ) we verify the multipartite nature of the entanglement by evaluating the van loock - furusawa criterion for a particular set of entanglement witnesses deduced from physical considerations .
