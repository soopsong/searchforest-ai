the interplay between coherent tunnel coupling and on - site interactions in dissipation - free bosonic systems has lead to many spectacular observations , ranging from the demonstration of number - phase uncertainty relation to quantum phase transitions . to explore the effect of dissipation and coherent drive on tunnel coupled interacting bosonic systems , we propose a device that is the quantum optical analog of a josephson interferometer . it consists of two coherently driven linear optical cavities connected via a central cavity with a single - photon nonlinearity . the josephson - like oscillations in the light emitted from the central cavity as a function of the phase difference between two pumping fields can be suppressed by increasing the strength of the nonlinear coupling . remarkably , we find that in the limit of ultra - strong interactions in the center - cavity , the coupled system maps on to an effective jaynes - cummings system with a nonlinearity determined by the tunnel coupling strength . in the limit of a single nonlinear cavity coupled to two linear waveguides , the degree of photon antibunching from the nonlinear cavity provides an excellent measure of the transition to the nonlinear regime where josephson oscillations are suppressed .
