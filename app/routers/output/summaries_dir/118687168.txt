the entanglement spectrum of a pure state of a bipartite system is the full set of eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix obtained from tracing out one part . such spectra are known in several cases to contain important information beyond that in the entanglement entropy . this paper studies the entanglement spectrum for a variety of critical and near - critical quantum lattice models in one dimension , chiefly by the itebd numerical method , which enables both integrable and non - integrable models to be studied . we find that the distribution of eigenvalues in the entanglement spectra agrees with an approximate result derived by calabrese and lefevre to an accuracy of a few percent for all models studied . this result applies whether the correlation length is intrinsic or generated by the finite matrix size accessible in itebd . for the transverse ising model , the known exact results for the entanglement spectrum are used to confirm the validity of the itebd approach . for more general models , no exact result is available but the itebd results directly test the hypothesis that all moments of the reduced density matrix are determined by a single parameter .
