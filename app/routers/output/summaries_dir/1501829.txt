we discuss concepts of message identification in the sense of ahlswede and dueck via general quantum channels , extending investigations for classical channels , initial work for classical - quantum ( cq ) channels and"quantum fingerprinting " . we show that the identification capacity of a discrete memoryless quantum channel for classical information can be larger than that for transmission ; this is in contrast to all previously considered models , where it turns out to equal the common randomness capacity ( equals transmission capacity in our case ) : in particular , for a noiseless qubit , we show the identification capacity to be 2 , while transmission and common randomness capacity are 1 . then we turn to a natural concept of identification of quantum messages ( i.e. a notion of"fingerprint"for quantum states ) . this is much closer to quantum information transmission than its classical counterpart ( for one thing , the code length grows only exponentially , compared to double exponentially for classical identification ) . indeed , we show how the problem exhibits a nice connection to visible quantum coding . astonishingly , for the noiseless qubit channel this capacity turns out to be 2 : in other words , one can compress two qubits into one and this is optimal . in general however , we conjecture quantum identification capacity to be different from classical identification capacity .
