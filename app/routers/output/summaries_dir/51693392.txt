most experimental protocols for measuring scrambling require time evolution with a hamiltonian and with the hamiltonian 's negative counterpart ( backwards time evolution ) . engineering controllable quantum many - body systems for which such forward and backward evolution is possible is a significant experimental challenge . furthermore , if the system of interest is quantum - chaotic , one might worry that any small errors in the time reversal will be rapidly amplified , obscuring the physics of scrambling . this paper undermines this expectation : we exhibit a renormalization protocol that extracts nearly ideal out - of - time - ordered - correlator measurements from imperfect experimental measurements . we analytically and numerically demonstrate the protocol 's effectiveness , up to the scrambling time , in a variety of models and for sizable imperfections . the scheme extends to errors from decoherence by an environment .
