we define a nature - inspired model for entanglement optimization in the quantum internet . the optimization model aims to maximize the entanglement fidelity and relative entropy of entanglement for the entangled connections of the entangled network structure of the quantum internet . the cost functions are subject of a minimization defined to cover and integrate the physical attributes of entanglement transmission , purification , and storage of entanglement in quantum memories . the method can be implemented with low complexity that allows a straightforward application in the quantum internet and quantum networking scenarios .
