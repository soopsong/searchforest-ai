problems in realization of silicon - based solid - state nmr quantum computer with ensemble addressing to qubits are considered . it is presented the extension of kane 's scheme to ensemble approach version with strip gates . for the initialization of nuclear quantum states it is proposed to use the solid - state effect in endor technique whereby the nuclear spins can be practically fully polarized or , that is the same , indirect cooled to the spin temperature less than ~ 1 mk . it is suggested the possible planar silicon topology of such ensemble quantum computer and shown that the measurement with standard nmr methods signal of l ~ 10 ^ 3 qubit system may be achieved for a number of ensemble components n>= 10 ^ 5 . as another variant of ensemble silicon quantum computer the gateless architecture of cellular - automaton is also considered . the decoherence of quantum states in the ensemble quantum computers and ways of its suppression is also discussed .
