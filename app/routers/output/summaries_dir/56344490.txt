gaussian noise induced by loss on gaussian states may be corrected by distributing epr entanglement through the loss channel , purifying the entanglement using a noiseless linear amplifier ( nla ) and then using it for continuous - variable teleportation of the input state . linear optical implementations of the nla unavoidably introduce small amounts of excess noise and detection and source efficiency will be limited in current implementations . in this paper , we analyze the error - correction protocol with non - unit efficiency sources and detectors and show the excess noise may be partially compensated by adjusting the classical gain of the teleportation protocol . we present a strong case for the potential of demonstrable error - correction with current technology .
