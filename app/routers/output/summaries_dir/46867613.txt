we analyze magnetometry using an optically levitated nanodiamond . we consider a configuration where a magnetic field gradient couples the mechanical oscillation of the diamond with its spin degree of freedom provided by a nitrogen vacancy center . first , we investigate measurement of the position spectrum of the mechanical oscillator . we find that conditions of ultrahigh vacuum and feedback cooling allow a magnetic field gradient sensitivity of 1 $ \mu$tm$^{-1}$/$\sqrt{\mbox{hz}}$. at high pressure and room temperature , this sensitivity degrades and can attain a value of the order of 100 $ m$tm$^{-1}$/$\sqrt{\mbox{hz}}$. subsequently , we characterize the magnetic field gradient sensitivity obtainable by maneuvering the spin degrees of freedom using ramsey interferometry . we find that this technique can offer photon - shot noise and spin - projection noise limited magnetic field gradient sensitivity of 100 $ \mu$tm$^{-1}$/$\sqrt{\mbox{hz}}$. we conclude that this hybrid levitated nanomechanical magnetometer provides a favorable and versatile platform for sensing applications .
