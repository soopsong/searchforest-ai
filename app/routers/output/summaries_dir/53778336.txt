using spatial modes for quantum key distribution ( qkd ) has become highly topical due to their infinite dimensionality , promising high information capacity per photon . however , spatial distortions reduce the feasible secret key rates and compromise the security of a quantum channel . in an extreme form such a distortion might be a physical obstacle , impeding line - of - sight for free - space channels . here , by controlling the radial degree of freedom of a photon 's spatial mode , we are able to demonstrate hybrid high - dimensional qkd through obstacles with self - reconstructing single photons . we construct high - dimensional mutually unbiased bases using spin - orbit hybrid states that are radially modulated with a non - diffracting bessel - gaussian ( bg ) profile , and show secure transmission through partially obstructed quantum links . using a prepare - measure protocol we report higher quantum state self - reconstruction and information retention for the non - diffracting bg modes as compared to laguerre - gaussian modes , obtaining a quantum bit error rate ( qber ) that is up to 3 times lower . this work highlights the importance of controlling the radial mode of single photons in quantum information processing and communication as well as the advantages of qkd with hybrid states .
