this paper introduces a problem of coherent - classical estimation for a class of linear quantum systems . in this problem , the estimator is a mixed quantum - classical system which produces a classical estimate of a system variable . the coherent - classical estimator may also involve coherent feedback . an example involving optical squeezers is given to illustrate the efficacy of this idea .
