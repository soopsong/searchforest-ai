the problem of finding symmetric informationally complete povms ( sic - povms ) has been solved numerically for all dimensions $ d$ up to 67 ( a.j . scott and m. grassl , { \it j. math . phys . } 51:042203 , 2010 ) , but a general proof of existence is still lacking . for each dimension , it was shown that it is possible to find a sic - povm which is generated from a fiducial state upon application of the operators of the heisenberg - weyl group . we draw on the numerically determined fiducial states to study their phase - space features , as displayed by the characteristic function and the wigner , bargmann and husimi representations , adapted to a hilbert space of finite dimension . we analyze the phase - space localization of fiducial states , and observe that the sic - povm condition is equivalent to a maximal delocalization property . finally , we explore the consequences in phase space of the conjectured zauner symmetry . in particular , we construct an hermitian operator commuting with this symmetry that leads to a representation of fiducial states in terms of eigenfunctions with definite semiclassical features .
