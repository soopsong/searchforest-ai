we show how to perform reversible universal quantum computation on a translationally invariant pure state , using only global operations based on next - neighbor interactions . we do not need not to break the translational symmetry of the state at any time during the computation . since the proposed scheme fulfills the locality condition of a quantum cellular automata , we present a reversible quantum cellular automaton capable of universal quantum computation .
