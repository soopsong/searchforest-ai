we propose to realize mechanical parity - time pt symmetry in two coupled optomechanical systems . to provide gain to one mechanical resonator and the same amount of damping to the other , the two optical cavities should be driven by blue- and red - detuned laser fields , respectively . after adiabatically eliminating the degrees of freedom of the cavity modes , we derive a formula to describe the pt symmetry of two coupled mechanical resonators . mechanical pt - symmetric phase transition is demonstrated by the dynamical behavior of the mechanical resonators . moreover , we study the effect of the quantum noises on the dynamical behavior of the mechanical resonators when the system is in the quantum regime .
