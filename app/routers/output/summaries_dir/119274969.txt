the quantum dynamics of optomechanical systems was mostly studied for their fluctuations around classical steady states . we present a theoretical approach to determining the system observables of optomechanical systems as genuine quantum objects , for example , a coupled quantum mechanical oscillator to a cavity single photon . in this approach we study the dynamics of such systems in strong coupling regime . we find that , under strong optomechanical coupling , steady quantum states of optomechanical systems driven by continuous - wave single photons exhibit periodic oscillation and cavity noise considerably affects system observables .
