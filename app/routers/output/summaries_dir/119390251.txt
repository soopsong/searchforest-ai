we present a local - hidden - variable model for positive - operator - valued measurements ( an lhvpov model ) on a class of entangled generalized werner states , thus demonstrating that such measurements do not always violate a bell - type inequality . we also show that , in general , if the state $ \rho'$ can be obtained from $ \rho$ with certainty by local quantum operations without classical communication then an lhvpov model for the state $ \rho$ implies the existence of such a model for $ \rho'$.
