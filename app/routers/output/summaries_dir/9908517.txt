we study a method to cool down the vibration mode of a micro - mechanical beam using a capacitively - coupled superconducting transmission line . the coulomb force between the transmission line and the beam is determined by the driving microwave on the transmission line and the displacement of the beam . when the frequency of the driving microwave is smaller than that of the transmission line resonator , the coulomb force can oppose the velocity of the beam . thus , the beam can be cooled . this mechanism , which may enable to prepare the beam in its quantum ground state of vibration , is feasible under current experimental conditions .
