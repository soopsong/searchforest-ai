recently , a novel three - dimensional entangled state called tree - type entanglement , which is likely to have applications for improving quantum communication security , was prepared via adiabatic passage by song et al . [ phys . rev . a 93 , 062321 ( 2016 ) ] . here we propose two schemes for fast generations of tree - type three - dimensional entanglement among three spatially separated atoms via shortcuts to adiabatic passage . with the help of quantum zeno dynamics , two kinds of different but equivalent methods , lewis - riesenfeld invariants and transitionless quantum driving , are applied to construct shortcuts to adiabatic passage . the comparisons between the two methods are discussed . the strict numerical simulations show that the tree - type three - dimensional entangled states can be fast prepared with quite high fidelities and the two schemes are both robust against the variations in the parameters , atomic spontaneous emissions and the cavity - fiber photon leakages .
