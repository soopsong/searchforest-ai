in this paper we define a kind of decomposition for a quantum access structure . we propose a conception of minimal maximal quantum access structure and obtain a sufficient and necessary condition for minimal maximal quantum access structure , which shows the relationship between the number of minimal authorized sets and that of the players . moreover , we investigate the construction of efficient quantum secret schemes by using these techniques , a decomposition and minimal maximal quantum access structure . a major advantage of these techniques is that it allows us to construct a method to realize a general quantum access structure . for these quantum access structures , we present two quantum secret schemes via the idea of concatenation or a decomposition of a quantum access structure . as a consequence , the application of these techniques allow us to save more quantum shares and reduce more cost than the existing scheme .
