a new model of quantum random walks is introduced , on lattices as well as on finite graphs . these quantum random walks take into account the behavior of open quantum systems . they are the exact quantum analogues of classical markov chains . we explore the"quantum trajectory"point of view on these quantum random walks , that is , we show that measuring the position of the particle after each time- step gives rise to a classical markov chain , on the lattice times the state space of the particle . this quantum trajectory is a simulation of the master equation of the quantum random walk . the physical pertinence of such quantum random walks and the way they can be concretely realized is discussed . differences and connections with the already well - known quantum random walks , such as the hadamard random walk , are established .
