there has been recent progress in understanding chaotic features in many - body quantum systems . motivated by the scrambling of information in black holes , it has been suggested that the time dependence of out - of - time - ordered ( oto ) correlation functions such as $ \langle o_2(t ) o_1(0 ) o_2(t ) o_1(0 ) \rangle $ is a faithful measure of quantum chaos . experimentally , these correlators are challenging to access since they apparently require access to both forward and backward time evolution with the system hamiltonian . here , we propose a protocol to measure such oto correlators using an ancilla which controls the direction of time . specifically , by coupling the state of ancilla to the system hamiltonian of interest , we can emulate the forward and backward time propagation , where the ancilla plays the role of a ' quantum clock ' . within this scheme , the continuous evolution of the entire system ( the system of interest and the ancilla ) is governed by a time - independent hamiltonian . our protocol is immune to errors that could occur when the direction of time evolution is externally controlled by a classical switch .
