we introduce a class of multiqubit quantum states which generalizes graph states . these states correspond to an underlying mathematical hypergraph , i.e. a graph where edges connecting more than two vertices are considered . we derive a generalised stabilizer formalism to describe this class of states . we introduce the notion of k - uniformity and show that this gives rise to classes of states which are inequivalent under the action of the local pauli group . finally we disclose a one - to - one correspondence with states employed in quantum algorithms , such as deutsch - jozsa 's and grover 's .
