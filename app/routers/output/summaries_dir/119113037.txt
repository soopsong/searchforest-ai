we extend the idea of quantum phase transitions of light in atom - photon system with dicke - bose - hubbard model for arbitrary number of two - level atoms . the formulations of eigenenergies , effective rabi frequencies , and critical chemical potentials for two atoms are derived . with a self - consistent method , we obtain a complete phase diagram for two two - level atoms on resonance , which indicates the transition from mott insulator to superfluidity and with a mean excitations diagram for confirmation . we illustrate the generality of the method by constructing the dressed - state basis for arbitrary number of two - level atoms . in addition , we show that the mott insulator lobes in the phase diagrams will smash out with the increase of atom numbers . the results of this work provide a step for studying the effects with combinations of dicke - like and hubbard - like models to simulate strongly correlated electron systems using photons .
