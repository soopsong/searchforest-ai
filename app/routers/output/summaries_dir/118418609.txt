properties of quantum states have disclosed new and revolutionary technologies , ranging from quantum information to quantum imaging . this last field is addressed to overcome limits of classical imaging by exploiting specific properties of quantum states of light . one of the most interesting proposed scheme exploits spatial quantum correlations between twin beams for realizing sub - shot - noise imaging of the weak absorbing objects , leading ideally to a noise - free imaging . here we discuss in detail the experimental realization of this scheme , showing its capability to reach a larger signal to noise ratio with respect to classical imaging methods and , therefore , its interest for future practical applications .
