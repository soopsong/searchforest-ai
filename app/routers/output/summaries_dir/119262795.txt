non - reciprocal devices , with one - way transport properties , form a key component for isolating and controlling light in photonic systems . optomechanical systems have emerged as a potential platform for optical non - reciprocity , due to ability of a pump laser to break time and parity symmetry in the system . here we consider how the non - reciprocal behavior of light can also impact the transport of sound in optomechanical devices . we focus on the case of a quasi one dimensional optical ring resonator with many mechanical modes coupled to light via the acousto - optic effect . the addition of disorder leads to finite diffusion for phonon transport in the material , largely due to elastic backscattering between clockwise and counter - clockwise phonons . we show that a laser pump field , along with the assumption of high quality - factor , sideband - resolved optical resonances , suppresses the effects of disorder and leads to the emergence of chiral diffusion , with direction - dependent diffusion emerging in a bandwidth similar to the phase - matching bandwidth for brillouin scattering . a simple diagrammatic theory connects the observation of reduced mechanical linewidths directly to the associated phonon diffusion properties , and helps explain recent experimental results .
