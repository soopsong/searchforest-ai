we study the transport of a single photon in two coupled one - dimensional semi - infinite coupled - resonator waveguides ( crws ) , in which both end sides are coupled to a dissipative cavity . we demonstrate that a single photon can transfer from one semi - infinite crw to the other nonreciprocally . based on such nonreciprocity , we further construct a three - port single - photon circulator by a t - shaped waveguide , in which three semi - infinite crws are pairwise mutually coupled to each other . the single - photon nonreciprocal transport is induced by the breaking of the time - reversal symmetry and the optimal conditions for these phenomena are obtained analytically . the crws with broken time - reversal symmetry will open up a kind of quantum devices with versatile applications in quantum networks .
