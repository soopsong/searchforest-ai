recent progress in zauner 's conjecture has leveraged deep conjectures in algebraic number theory to promote numerical line packings to exact and verifiable solutions to the line packing problem . we introduce a numerical - to - exact technique in the real setting that does not require such conjectures . our approach is completely reproducible , matching sloane 's database of putatively optimal numerical line packings with mathematica 's built - in implementation of cylindrical algebraic decomposition . as a proof of concept , we promote a putatively optimal numerical packing of eight points in the real projective plane to an exact packing , whose optimality we establish in a forthcoming paper .
