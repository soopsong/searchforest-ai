we study quantum tomography based on a stochastic continuous - time measurement record obtained from a probe field collectively interacting with an ensemble of identically prepared systems . in comparison to previous studies , we consider here the case in which the measurement - induced backaction has a nonnegligible effect on the dynamical evolution of the ensemble . we formulate a maximum likelihood estimate for the initial quantum state given only a single instance of the continuous diffusive measurement record . we apply our estimator to the simplest problem -- state tomography of a single pure qubit , which , during the course of the measurement , is also subjected to dynamical control . we identify a regime where the many - body system is well approximated at all times by a separable pure spin coherent state , whose bloch vector undergoes a conditional stochastic evolution . we simulate the results of our estimator and show that we can achieve close to the upper bound of fidelity set by the optimal povm . this estimate is compared to , and significantly outperforms , an equivalent estimator that ignores measurement backaction .
