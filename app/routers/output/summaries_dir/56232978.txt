in a setting of noncommutative space with minimal length we confirm the general assertion that the more nonclassical an input state for a beam splitter is , the more entangled its output state becomes . by analysing various nonclassical properties we find that the odd schr\"odinger cat states are more nonclassical than the even schr\"odinger cat states , hence producing more entanglement , which in turn are more nonclassical than coherent states . both the nonclassicality and the entanglement can be enhanced by increasing the noncommutativity of the underlying space . in addition we find as a by - product some rare explicit minimum uncertainty quadrature and number squeezed states , i.e. ideal squeezed states .
