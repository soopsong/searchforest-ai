we present an experimental study on the cavity - atom ensemble system , and realize the doubly - resonant cavity enhanced electromagnetically induced transparency , where both the probe and control lasers are resonant with a fabry - perot cavity . we demonstrate the precise frequency manipulating of the hybrid optical - atomic resonances , through either temperature or cavity length tuning . in such a system , the control power can be greatly enhanced due to the cavity , and all - optical switching is achieved with a much lower control laser power compared to previous studies . a new theoretical model is developed to describe the effective three - wave mixing process between spin - wave and optical modes . interesting non - hermitian physics are predicted theoretically and demonstrated experimentally . such a doubly - resonant cavity - atom ensemble system without a specially designed cavity can be used for future applications , such as optical signal storage and microwave - to - optical frequency conversion .
