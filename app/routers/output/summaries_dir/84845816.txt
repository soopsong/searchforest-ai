the public access to noisy intermediate - scale quantum ( nisq ) computers facilitated by ibm , rigetti , d - wave , etc . , has propelled the development of quantum applications that may offer quantum supremacy in the future large - scale quantum computers . parameterized quantum circuits ( pqc ) have emerged as a major driver for the development of quantum routines that potentially improve the circuit 's resilience to the noise . pqc 's have been applied in both generative ( e.g. generative adversarial network ) and discriminative ( e.g. quantum classifier ) tasks in the field of quantum machine learning . pqc 's have been also considered to realize high fidelity quantum gates with the available imperfect native gates of a target quantum hardware . parameters of a pqc are determined through an iterative training process for a target noisy quantum hardware . however , temporal variations in qubit quality metrics affect the performance of a pqc . therefore , the circuit that is trained without considering temporal variations exhibits poor fidelity over time . in this paper , we present training methodologies for pqc in a completely classical environment that can improve the fidelity of the trained pqc on a target nisq hardware by as much as 42.5 % .
