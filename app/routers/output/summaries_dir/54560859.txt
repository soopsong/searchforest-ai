when a black hole forms from collapse in a holographic theory , the information in the black hole interior remains encoded in the boundary . we prove that the area of the black hole 's apparent horizon is precisely the entropy associated to coarse graining over the information in its interior , subject to knowing the exterior geometry . this is the maximum holographic entanglement entropy that is compatible with all classical measurements conducted outside of the apparent horizon . we identify the boundary dual to this entropy and explain why it obeys a second law of thermodynamics .
