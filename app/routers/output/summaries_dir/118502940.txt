photons can carry spin angular momentum ( sam ) and orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , which can be used to realize a qubit system and a high - dimension system respectively . this spin - orbital system is very suitable for implementing one - dimensional discrete - time quantum random walks . we propose a simple scheme of quantum walks on the spin - orbital angular momentum space of photons , where photons walk on the infinity oam space controlled by their sam . by employing the recent invention of an optical device , the so - called ' q - plate ' , our scheme is more simple and efficient than others because there is no mach - zehnder interferometer in the scheme .
