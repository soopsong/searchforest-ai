we develop dynamical non - markovian description of quantum computing in weak coupling limit , in lowest order approximation . we show that long range memory of quantum reservoir produces strong interrelation between structure of noise and quantum algorithm , implying nonlocal attacks of noise . we then argue that the quantum error correction method fails to protect quantum computation against electromagnetic or phonon vacuum which exhibit $ 1 / t^4 $ memory . this shows that the implicit assumption of quantum error correction theory -- independence of noise and self - dynamics -- fails in long time regimes . we also use our approach to present { \it pure } decoherence and decoherence accompanied by dissipation in terms of spectral density of reservoir . the so - called { \it dynamical decoupling } method is discussed in this context . finally , we propose { \it minimal decoherence model } , in which the only source of decoherence is vacuum . we optimize fidelity of quantum information processing under the trade - off between speed of gate and strength of decoherence .
