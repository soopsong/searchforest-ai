we construct new families of multi - error - correcting quantum codes for the amplitude damping channel . our key observation is that , with proper encoding , two uses of the amplitude damping channel simulate a quantum erasure channel . this allows us to use concatenated codes with quantum erasure - correcting codes as outer codes for correcting multiple amplitude damping errors . our new codes are degenerate stabilizer codes and have parameters which are better than the amplitude damping codes obtained by any previously known construction .
