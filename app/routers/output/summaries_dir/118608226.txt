boson - sampling has been presented as a simplified model for linear optical quantum computing . in the boson - sampling model , fock states are passed through a linear optics network and sampled via number - resolved photodetection . it has been shown that this sampling problem likely can not be efficiently classically simulated . this raises the question as to whether there are other quantum states of light for which the equivalent sampling problem is also computationally hard . we present evidence , without using a full complexity proof , that a very broad class of quantum states of light --- arbitrary superpositions of two or more coherent states --- when evolved via passive linear optics and sampled with number - resolved photodetection , likely implements a classically hard sampling problem .
