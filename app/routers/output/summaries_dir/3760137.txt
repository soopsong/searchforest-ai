we develop a tensor network technique that can solve universal reversible classical computational problems , formulated as vertex models on a square lattice [ nat . commun . 8 , 15303 ( 2017 ) ] . by encoding the truth table of each vertex constraint in a tensor , the total number of solutions compatible with partial inputs / outputs at the boundary can be represented as the full contraction of a tensor network . we introduce an iterative compression - decimation ( icd ) scheme that performs this contraction efficiently . the icd algorithm first propagates local constraints to longer ranges via repeated contraction - decomposition sweeps over all lattice bonds , thus achieving compression on a given length scale . it then decimates the lattice via coarse - graining tensor contractions . repeated iterations of these two steps gradually collapse the tensor network and ultimately yield the exact tensor trace for large systems , without the need for manual control of tensor dimensions . our protocol allows us to obtain the exact number of solutions for computations where a naive enumeration would take astronomically long times .
