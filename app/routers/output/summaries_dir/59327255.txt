weak measurement of a quantum system followed by postselection based on a subsequent strong measurement gives rise to a quantity called the weak value : a complex number for which the interpretation has long been debated . we analyse the procedure of weak measurement and postselection , and the interpretation of the associated weak value , using a theory of classical mechanics supplemented by an epistemic restriction that is known to be operationally equivalent to a subtheory of quantum mechanics . both the real and imaginary components of the weak value appear as phase space displacements in the postselected expectation values of the measurement device 's position and momentum distributions , and we recover the same displacements as in the quantum case by studying the corresponding evolution in the classical theory . by using this analogous classical theory , we gain insight into the appearance of the weak value as a result of the statistical effects of post selection , and this provides us with an operational interpretation of the weak value , both its real and imaginary parts . we find that the imaginary part of the weak value is a measure of how much postselection biases the mean phase space distribution for a given amount of measurement disturbance . all such biases proportional to the imaginary part of the weak value vanish in the limit where disturbance due to measurement goes to zero . our analysis also offers intuitive insight into how measurement disturbance can be minimised and the limits of weak measurement .
