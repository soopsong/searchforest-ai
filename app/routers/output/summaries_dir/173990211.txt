noncommutative phase - space and its effects have been studied in different settings in physics , in order to unveil a better understanding of phase - space structures . here , we use the thermal diffusion approach to study how noncommutative effects can influence the time evolution of a one - mode gaussian state when in contact with a thermal environment obeying the markov approximation . employing the cooling process and considering the system of interest as a one - mode gaussian state , we show that the fidelity comparing the gaussian state of the system in different times and the asymptotic thermal state is useful to sign noncommuative effects . besides , by using the monotonicity behavior of the fidelity , we discuss some aspects of non - markovianity during the dynamics .
