we present a systems theory approach to the proof of a result bounding the required level of added quantum noise in a phase - insensitive quantum amplifier . we also present a synthesis procedure for constructing a quantum optical phase - insensitive quantum amplifier which adds the minimum level of quantum noise and achieves a required gain and bandwidth . this synthesis procedure is based on a singularly perturbed quantum system and leads to an amplifier involving two squeezers and two beamsplitters .
