we propose several parametrization - free solutions to the problem of quantum state reduction control by means of continuous measurement and smooth quantum feedback . in particular , we design a feedback law for which almost global stochastic feedback stabilization can be proved analytically by means of lyapunov techinques . this synthesis arises very naturally from the physics of the problem , as it relies on the variance associated with the quantum filtering process .
