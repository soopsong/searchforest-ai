fast scramblers process information in characteristic times scaling logarithmically with the entropy , a behavior which has been conjectured for black hole horizons . in this note we use the ads / cft fold to argue that causality bounds on information flow only depend on the properties of a single thermal cell , and admit a geometrical interpretation in terms of the optical depth , i.e. the thickness of the rindler region in the so - called optical metric . the spatial sections of the optical metric are well approximated by constant - curvature hyperboloids . we use this fact to propose an effective kinetic model of scrambling which can be assimilated to a compact hyperbolic billiard , furnishing a classic example of hard chaos . it is suggested that classical chaos at large n is a crucial ingredient in reconciling the notion of fast scrambling with the required saturation of causality .
