we discuss in detail the implementation of an open - system quantum simulator with rydberg states of neutral atoms held in an optical lattice . our scheme allows one to realize both coherent as well as dissipative dynamics of complex spin models involving many - body interactions and constraints . the central building block of the simulation scheme is constituted by a mesoscopic rydberg gate that permits the entanglement of several atoms in an efficient , robust and quick protocol . in addition , optical pumping on ancillary atoms provides the dissipative ingredient for engineering the coupling between the system and a tailored environment . as an illustration , we discuss how the simulator enables the simulation of coherent evolution of quantum spin models such as the two - dimensional heisenberg model and kitaev 's toric code , which involves four - body spin interactions . we moreover show that in principle also the simulation of lattice fermions can be achieved . as an example for controlled dissipative dynamics , we discuss ground state cooling of frustration - free spin hamiltonians .
