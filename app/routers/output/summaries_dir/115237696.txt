the characterization of the evolution of a quantum system is one of the main tasks to accomplish to achieve quantum information processing . the standard quantum process tomography ( sqpt ) has the unique property that it can be applied without introducing any additional quantum resources . in present work , we shall focus on the following two topics about the sqpt . at first , in the sqpt protocol for a $ d$-dimensional system , one should encounter a problem in solving of a set of $ d^4 $ linear equations in order to get the matrix containing the complete information about the unknown quantum channel . until now , the general form of the solution is unknown . and a long existed conviction is that the solutions are not unique . here , we shall develop a self - consistent scheme , in which bounded linear operators are presented by vectors , to construct the set of linear equations . with the famous cramer 's rule for the set of linear equations , we are able to give the general form of the solution and prove that it is unique . in second , the central idea of the sqpt is to prepare a set of linearly independent inputs and measuring the outputs via the quantum state tomography ( qst ) . letting the inputs and the measurements be prepared by two sets of the rank - one positive - operator - valued measures [ povms ] , where each povm is supposed to be linearly independent and informationally complete ( ic ) , we observe that sqpt now is equivalent to deciding a unknown state with a set of product ic - povm in the $ d^2$-dimensional hilbert space . following the general linear state tomography theory , we show that the product symmetric ic - povm should minimize the mean - square hilbert - schmidt distance between the estimator and the true states . so , an optimal sqpt can be realized by preparing both the inputs and the measurements as the symmetric ic - povm .
