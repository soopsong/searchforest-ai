we report on some quantum properties of physical systems , namely , entanglement , nonlocality , $ k$-copy nonlocality ( superactivation of nonlocality ) , hidden nonlocality ( activation of nonlocality through local filtering ) and the activation of nonlocality through tensoring and local filtering . the aim of this work is two - fold . first , we provide a review of the numerical procedures that must be followed in order to calculate the aforementioned properties , in particular , for any two - qubit system , and reproduce the bounds for two - qudit werner states . second , we use such numerical tools to calculate new bounds of these properties for two - qudit isotropic states and two - qubit hirsch states .
