an efficient multi - mode quantum memory is a crucial resource for long - distance quantum communication based on quantum repeaters . we propose a quantum memory based on spectral shaping of an inhomogeneously broadened optical transition into an atomic frequency comb ( afc ) . the spectral width of the afc allows efficient storage of multiple temporal modes , without the need to increase the absorption depth of the storage material , in contrast to previously known quantum memories . efficient readout is possible thanks to rephasing of the atomic dipoles due to the afc structure . long - time storage and on - demand readout is achieved by use of spin - states in a lambda - type configuration . we show that an afc quantum memory realized in solids doped with rare - earth - metal ions could store hundreds of modes or more with close to unit efficiency , for material parameters achievable today .
