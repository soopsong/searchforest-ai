we study the interaction of dielectric rods and disks with the laser field of a high finesse cavity . the quantum master equation for the coupled particle - cavity dynamics , including rayleigh scattering , is derived for particle sizes comparable to the laser wavelength . we demonstrate that such anisotropic nanoparticles can be captured from free flight at velocities higher than those required to capture dielectric spheres of the same volume , and that efficient ro - translational cavity cooling into the deep quantum regime is achievable .
