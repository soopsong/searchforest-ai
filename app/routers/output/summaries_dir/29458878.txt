we show the existence of an inherent property of evanescent electromagnetic waves : spin - momentum locking , where the direction of momentum fundamentally locks the polarization of the wave . we trace the ultimate origin of this phenomenon to complex dispersion and causality requirements on evanescent waves . we demonstrate that every case of evanescent waves in total internal reflection , surface states and optical fibers / waveguides possesses this intrinsic spin - momentum locking . we also introduce a universal right - handed triplet consisting of momentum , decay and spin for evanescent waves . we derive the stokes parameters for evanescent waves which reveal an intriguing result - every fast decaying evanescent wave is inherently circularly polarized with its handedness tied to the direction of propagation . we also show the existence of a fundamental angle associated with total internal reflection ( tir ) such that propagating waves locally inherit perfect circular polarized characteristics from the evanescent wave . this circular tir condition occurs if and only if the ratio of permittivities of the two dielectric media exceeds the golden ratio . our work leads to a unified understanding of this spin - momentum locking in various nanophotonic experiments and sheds light on the electromagnetic analogy with the quantum spin hall state for electrons .
