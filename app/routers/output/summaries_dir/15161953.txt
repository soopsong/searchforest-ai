the purpose of this paper is to examine stochastic markovian models for circuits in phase space for which the drift term is equivalent to the standard circuit equations . in particular we include dissipative components corresponding to both a resistor and a memristor in series . we obtain a dilation of the problem for which is canonical in the sense that the underlying poisson brackets structure is preserved under the stochastic flow . we do this first of all for standard wiener noise , but also treat the problem using a new concept of symplectic noise where the poisson structure is extended to the noise as well as the circuit variables , and in particular where we have canonically conjugate noises . finally we construct a dilation which describes the quantum mechanical analogue .
