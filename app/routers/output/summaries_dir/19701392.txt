the spectrum of the lipkin - meshkov - glick model is exactly derived in the thermodynamic limit by means of a spin coherent states formalism . in the first step , a classical analysis allows one to distinguish between four distinct regions in the parameter space according to the nature of the singularities arising in the classical energy surface ; these correspond to spectral critical points . the eigenfunctions are then analyzed more precisely in terms of the associated roots of the majorana polynomial , leading to exact expressions for the density of states in the thermodynamic limit . finite - size effects are also analyzed , leading in particular to logarithmic corrections near the singularities occuring in the spectrum . finally , we also compute expectation values of the spin operators in a semi - classical analysis in order to illustrate some subtle effects occuring in one region of the parameter space .
