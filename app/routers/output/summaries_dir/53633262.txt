we introduce a simple quantum generalization of the spectrum of classical lyapunov exponents . we apply it to the syk and xxz models , and study the lyapunov growth and entropy production . our numerical results suggest that a black hole is not just the fastest scrambler , but also the fastest entropy generator . we also study the statistical features of the quantum lyapunov spectrum and find universal random matrix behavior , which resembles the recently - found universality in classical chaos . the random matrix behavior is lost when the system is deformed away from chaos , towards integrability or a many - body localized phase . we propose that quantum systems holographically dual to gravity satisfy this universality in a strong form . we further argue that the quantum lyapunov spectrum contains important additional information beyond the largest lyapunov exponent and hence provides us with a better characterization of chaos in quantum systems .
