besides the superior efficiency compared to their classical counterparts , quantum algorithms known so far are basically task - dependent , and scarcely any common features are shared between them . in this work , however , we show that the depletion of quantum coherence turns out to be a common phenomenon in these algorithms . for all the quantum algorithms that we investigated including grover 's algorithm , deutsch - jozsa algorithm and shor 's algorithm , quantum coherence of the system states reduces to the minimum along with the successful execution of the respective processes . notably , a similar conclusion can not be drawn using other quantitative measures such as quantum entanglement . thus , we expect that coherence depletion as a common feature can be useful for devising new quantum algorithms in the future .
