using quasiclassical approach rather precise analytical approximations for the eigenfrequencies of whispering gallery modes in convex axisymmetric bodies may be found . we use the eikonal method to analyze the limits of precision of quasiclassical approximation using as a practical example spheroidal dielectric cavity . the series obtained for the calculation of eigenfrequencies is compared with the known series for dielectric sphere and with numerical calculations . we show how geometrical interpretation allows expansion of the method on arbitrary shaped axisymmetric bodies .
