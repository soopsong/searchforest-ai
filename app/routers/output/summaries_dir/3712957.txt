we consider the logarithmic negativity , a measure of bipartite entanglement , in a general unitary 1 + 1-dimensional massive quantum field theory , not necessarily integrable . we compute the negativity between a finite region of length $ r$ and an adjacent semi - infinite region , and that between two semi - infinite regions separated by a distance $ r$. we show that the former saturates to a finite value , and that the latter tends to zero , as $ r\rightarrow\infty$. we show that in both cases , the leading corrections are exponential decays in $ r$ ( described by modified bessel functions ) that are solely controlled by the mass spectrum of the model , independently of its scattering matrix . this implies that , like the entanglement entropy , the logarithmic negativity displays a very high level of universality , allowing one to extract information about the mass spectrum . further , a study of sub - leading terms shows that , unlike the entanglement entropy , a large-$r$ analysis of the negativity allows for the detection of bound states .
