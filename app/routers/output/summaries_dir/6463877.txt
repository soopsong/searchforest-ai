cryogenically cooled buffer gas beam sources of the molecule thorium monoxide ( tho ) are optimized and characterized . both helium and neon buffer gas sources are shown to produce tho beams with high flux , low divergence , low forward velocity , and cold internal temperature for a variety of stagnation densities and nozzle diameters . the beam operates with a buffer gas stagnation density of ~10 ^ 15 - 10 ^ 16 cm^-3 ( reynolds number ~1 - 100 ) , resulting in expansion cooling of the internal temperature of the tho to as low as 2 k. for the neon ( helium ) based source , this represents cooling by a factor of about 10 ( 2 ) from the initial nozzle temperature of about 20 k ( 4 k ) . these sources deliver ~10 ^ 11 tho molecules in a single quantum state within a 1 - 3 ms long pulse at 10 hz repetition rate . under conditions optimized for a future precision spectroscopy application [ a c vutha et al 2010 j. phys . b : at . mol . opt . phys . 43 074007 ] , the neon - based beam has the following characteristics : forward velocity of 170 m / s , internal temperature of 3.4 k , and brightness of 3x10 ^ 11 ground state molecules per steradian per pulse . compared to typical supersonic sources , the relatively low stagnation density of this source , and the fact that the cooling mechanism relies only on collisions with an inert buffer gas , make it widely applicable to many atomic and molecular species , including those which are chemically reactive , such as tho .
