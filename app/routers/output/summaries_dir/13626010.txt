this paper provides an alternative approach to the problem of preparing pure gaussian states in a linear quantum system . it is shown that any pure gaussian state can be generated by a cascade of one - dimensional open quantum harmonic oscillators , without any direct interaction hamiltonians between these oscillators . this is physically advantageous from an experimental point of view . an example on the preparation of two - mode squeezed states is given to illustrate the theory .
