abstract : this is the final report for the afrl / ri in - house project cluster state quantum computation . under this project investigations were conducted which included : ( i ) the development and characterization of a new multipli - entangled photon source that increased the usable number of photon pairs by a factor of six over conventional entangled photon sources ; ( ii ) design of multi - layer superconducting number - resolving photon detector , ( iii ) a theoretical and experimental investigation into the requirements of imperfect ( non - unit fidelity ) two - qubit linear optical photonic gates ; ( iv ) a theoretical investigation of entanglement and nonlocality addressing the issue of why nature does not take advantage of the algebraically allowed maximum correlations amongst collections of qubits , and ( v ) a theoretical investigation into the a 2.25x more efficient means to generate linear cluster states . this latter investigation led to a patent for probabilistic cluster state generator , also discussed in this report .
