conserved quantities are crucial in quantum physics . here we discuss a general scenario of hamiltonians . all the hamiltonians within this scenario share a common conserved quantity form . for unitary parametrization processes , the characteristic operator of this scenario is analytically provided , as well as the corresponding quantum fisher information ( qfi ) . as the application of this scenario , we focus on two classes of hamiltonians : su(2 ) category and canonical category . several specific physical systems in these two categories are discussed in detail . besides , we also calculate an alternative form of qfi in this scenario .
