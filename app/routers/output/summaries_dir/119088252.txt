photon correlations between the photoluminescence peaks of the mollow triplet have been known for a long time , and recently hailed as a resource for heralded single - photon sources . here , we provide the full picture of photon - correlations at all orders ( we deal explicitly with up to four photons ) and with no restriction to the peculiar frequency windows enclosing the peaks . we show that a rich multi - photon physics lies between the peaks , due to transition involving virtual photons , and thereby much more strongly correlated than those transiting through the dressed states . specifically , we show that such emissions occur in bundles of photons rather than as successive , albeit correlated , photons . we provide the recipe to frequency - filter the emission of the mollow triplet to turn it into a versatile and tunable photon source , allowing in principle all scenarios of photon emission , with advantages already at the one - photon level , i.e. , providing more strongly correlated heralded single - photon sources than those already known .
