spin degrees of freedom of charged nitrogen - vacancy ( nv$^-$ ) centers in diamond have large decoherence times even at room temperature , can be initialized and read out using optical fields , and are therefore a promising candidate for solid state qubits . recently , quantum manipulations of nv$^-$- centers using rf fields were experimentally realized . in this paper we show ; first , that such operations can be controlled by varying the frequency of the signal , instead of its amplitude , and nv$^-$- centers can be selectively addressed even with spacially uniform rf signals ; second , that when several \nv - centers are placed in an off - resonance optical cavity , a similar application of classical optical fields provides a controlled coupling and enables a universal two - qubit gate ( cphase ) . rf and optical control together promise a scalable quantum computing architecture .
