we present some numerical results for nonlinear quantum walks ( nlqws ) studied by the authors analytically \cite{mssss18dcds , mssss18qip } . it was shown that if the nonlinearity is weak , then the long time behavior of nlqws are approximated by linear quantum walks . in this paper , we observe the linear decay of nlqws for range of nonlinearity wider than studied in \cite{mssss18dcds } . in addition , we treat the strong nonlinear regime and show that the solitonic behavior of solutions appears . there are several kinds of soliton solutions and the dynamics becomes complicated . however , we see that there are some special cases so that we can calculate explicit form of solutions . in order to understand the nonlinear dynamics , we systematically study the collision between soliton solutions . we can find a relationship between our model and a nonlinear differential equation .
