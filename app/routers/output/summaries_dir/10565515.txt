reversible logic circuit is a necessary construction for achieving ultra low power dissipation as well as for prominent post - cmos computing technologies such as quantum computing . consequently automatic synthesis of a boolean function using elementary reversible logic gates has received significant research attention in recent times , creating the domain of reversible logic synthesis . in this paper , we study the complexity of reversible logic synthesis . the problem is separately studied for bounded - ancilla and ancilla - free optimal synthesis approaches . the computational complexity for both cases are linked to known / presumed hard problems . finally , experiments are performed with a shortest - path based reversible logic synthesis approach and a ( 0 - 1 ) ilp - based formulation .
