it is known that relative entropy of entanglement for entangled state $ \rho$ is defined via its closest separable ( or positive partial transpose ) state $ \sigma$. recently , it has been shown how to find $ \rho$ provided that $ \sigma$ is given in two - qubit system . in this paper we study on the inverse process , i.e. how to find $ \sigma$ provided that $ \rho$ is given . it is shown that if $ \rho$ is one of bell - diagonal , generalized vedral - plenio and generalized horodecki states , one can always find $ \sigma$ from a geometrical point of view . this is possible due to the following two facts : ( i ) the bloch vectors of $ \rho$ and $ \sigma$ are identical with each other ( ii ) the qubit - interaction vector of $ \sigma$ can be computed from a crossing point between minimal geometrical object , in which all separable states reside in the presence of bloch vectors , and a straight line , which connects the point corresponding to the qubit - interaction vector of $ \rho$ and the nearest vertex of the maximal tetrahedron , where all two - qubit states reside . it is shown , however , that these nice properties are not maintained for the arbitrary two - qubit states .
