we analyze the performance of continuous - variable quantum key distribution protocols where the entangled source originates not from one of the trusted parties , alice or bob , but from the malicious eavesdropper in the middle . this is in contrast to the typical simulations where alice creates the entangled source and sends it over an insecure quantum channel to bob . by using previous techniques and identifying certain error correction protocol equivalences , we show that alice and bob do not need to trust their source , and can still generate a positive key rate . such a situation can occur in a quantum network where the untrusted source originated in between the two users .
