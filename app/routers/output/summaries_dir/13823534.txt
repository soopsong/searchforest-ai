we demonstrate efficient and reversible mapping of a light field onto a thulium - doped crystal using an atomic frequency comb ( afc ) . thanks to an accurate spectral preparation of the sample , we reach an efficiency of 9 % . our interpretation of the data is based on an original spectral analysis of the afc . by independently measuring the absorption spectrum , we show that the efficiency is both limited by the available optical thickness and the preparation procedure at large absorption depth for a given bandwidth . the experiment is repeated with less than one photon per pulse and single photon counting detectors . we clearly observe that the afc protocol is compatible with the noise level required for weak quantum field storage .
