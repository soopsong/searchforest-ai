we construct the coherent states of general order , $ m$ for the ladder operators , $ c(m)$ and $ c^\dagger(m)$ , which act on rational deformations of the harmonic oscillator . the position wavefunctions of the eigenvectors involve type iii hermite exceptional orthogonal polynomials . we plot energy expectations , time - dependent position probability densities for the coherent states and for the even and odd cat states , wigner functions , and heisenberg uncertainty relations . we find generally non - classical behaviour , with one exception : there is a regime of large magnitude of the coherent state parameter , $ z$ , where the otherwise indistinct position probability density separates into $ m+1 $ distinct wavepackets oscillating and colliding in the potential , forming interference fringes when they collide . the mandel $ q$ parameter is calculated to find sub - poissonian statistics , another indicator of non - classical behaviour . we plot the position standard deviation and find squeezing in many of the cases . we calculate the two - photon - number probability density for the output state when the $ m=4 $ , $ \mu=-5 $ coherent states ( where $ \mu$ labels the lowest weight in the superposition ) are placed on one arm of a beamsplitter . we find that it does not factorize , again indicating non - classical behaviour . calculation of the linear entropy for this beamsplitter output state shows significant entanglement , another non - classical feature . we also construct linearized versions , $ \tilde c(m)$ , of the annihilation operators and their coherent states and calculate the same properties that we investigate for the coherent states . for these we find similar behaviour to the $ c(m)$ coherent states , at much smaller magnitudes of $ z$ , but comparable average energies .
