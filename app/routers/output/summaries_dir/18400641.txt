it is conjectured that the holevo capacity of a product channel \omega \otimes \phi is achieved when product states are used as input . amosov , holevo and werner have also conjectured that the maximal p - norm of a product channel is achieved with product input states . in this paper we establish both of these conjectures in the case that \omega is arbitrary and \phi is a cq or qc channel ( as defined by holevo ) . we also establish the amosov , holevo and werner conjecture when \omega is arbitrary and either \phi is a qubit channel and p=2 , or \phi is a unital qubit channel and p is integer . our proofs involve a new conjecture for the norm of an output state of the half - noisy channel i \otimes \phi , when \phi is a qubit channel . we show that this conjecture in some cases also implies additivity of the holevo capacity .
