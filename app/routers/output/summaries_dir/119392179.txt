random number generation is an enabling technology for fields as varied as monte carlo simulations and quantum information science . an important application is a secure quantum key distribution ( qkd ) system ; here , we propose and demonstrate an approach to random number generation that satisfies the specific requirements for qkd . in our scheme , vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic - field inside a laser cavity are sampled in a discrete manner in time and amplified by injecting current pulses into the laser . random numbers can be obtained by interfering the laser pulses with another independent laser operating at the same frequency . using only off - the - shelf opto - electronics and fibre - optics components at 1.5 $ \mu$m wavelength , we experimentally demonstrate the generation of high - quality random bits at a rate of up to 1.5 ghz . our results show the potential of the new scheme for practical information processing applications .
