phase retrieval has become a very active area of research . we will classify when phase retrieval by parseval frames passes to the naimark complement and when phase retrieval by projections passes to the orthogonal complements . we introduce a new concept we call norm retrieval and show that this is what is necessary for passing phase retrieval to complements . this leads to a detailed study of norm retrieval and its relationship to phase retrieval . one fundamental result : a frame $ \{\varphi_i\}_{i=1}^m$ yields phase retrieval if and only if $ \{t\varphi_i\}_{i=1}^m$ yields norm retrieval for every invertible operator $ t$.
