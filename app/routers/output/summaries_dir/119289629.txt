we introduce the cross - cavity quantum rabi model describing the interaction of a single two - level system with two orthogonal boson fields and propose its quantum simulation by two - dimensional , bichromatic , first - sideband driving of a single trapped ion . we provide an introductory survey of the model , including its diagonalization in the two - level system basis , numerical spectra and its characteristics in the weak , ultra strong and deep strong coupling regimes . we also show that the particular case of degenerate field frequencies and balanced couplings allows us to cast the model as two parity deformed oscillators in any given coupling regime .
