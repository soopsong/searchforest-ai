in this paper , we study the control of a class of time - invariant linear ensemble systems whose natural dynamics are linear in the system parameter . this class of ensemble control systems arises from practical engineering and physical applications , such as transport of quantum particles and control of uncertain harmonic systems . we establish explicit algebraic criterions to examine controllability of such ensemble systems . our derivation is based on the notion of polynomial approximation , where the elements of the reachable set of the ensemble system are represented in polynomials of the system parameter and used to approximate the desired state of interest . in addition , we highlight the role of the spectra of the system matrices play in the determination of ensemble controllability . finally , illustrative examples and numerical simulations for optimal control of this class of linear ensemble systems are presented to demonstrate the theoretical results .
