we present a single - photon entanglement concentration protocol for long - distance quantum communication with quantum nondemolition detector . it is the first concentration protocol for single - photon entangled states and it dose not require the two parties of quantum communication to know the accurate information about the coefficient $ \alpha$ and $ \beta$ of the less entangled states . also , it does not resort to sophisticated single - photon detectors , which makes this protocol more feasible in current experiments . moreover , it can be iterated to get a higher efficiency and yield . all these advantages maybe make this protocol have more practical applications in long - distance quantum communication and quantum internet .
