we investigate the lipkin - meshkov - glick model coupled to a thermal bath . since the isolated model itself exhibits a quantum phase transition , we explore the critical signatures of the open system . starting from a system - reservoir interaction written in positive definite form , we find that the position of the critical point remains unchanged , in contrast to the popular mean - field prediction . technically , we employ the polaron transform to be able to study the full crossover regime from the normal to the symmetry - broken phase , which allows us to investigate the fate of quantum - critical points subject to dissipative environments . the signatures of the phase transition are reflected in observables like stationary mode occupation or waiting - time distributions .
