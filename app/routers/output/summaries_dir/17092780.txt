clifford gates are a winsome class of quantum operations combining mathematical elegance with physical significance . the gottesman - knill theorem asserts that clifford computations can be classically efficiently simulated but this is true only in a suitably restricted setting . here we consider clifford computations with a variety of additional ingredients : ( a ) strong vs. weak simulation , ( b ) inputs being computational basis states vs. general product states , ( c ) adaptive vs. non - adaptive choices of gates for circuits involving intermediate measurements , ( d ) single line outputs vs. multi - line outputs . we consider the classical simulation complexity of all combinations of these ingredients and show that many are not classically efficiently simulatable ( subject to common complexity assumptions such as p not equal to np ) . our results reveal a surprising proximity of classical to quantum computing power viz . a class of classically simulatable quantum circuits which yields universal quantum computation if extended by a purely classical additional ingredient that does not extend the class of quantum processes occurring .
