recently , physicists have started applying quantum information theory to black holes . this led to the conjecture that black holes are the fastest scramblers of information , and that they scramble it in time order m log m , where m is the mass of the black hole in natural units . as stated above , the conjecture is not completely defined , as there are several possible definitions of scrambling times . it appears that not all papers that refer to this conjecture interpret it the same way . we consider a definition of scrambling time stronger than the one given in the paper that first proposed this conjecture [ sekino and susskind , jhep 0810:065 ( 2008 ) ] , and show that this stronger version of the conjecture appears to be incompatible with a number of other widely - believed and reasonable - sounding properties of black holes . we argue that for the scrambling time of a black hole to be this fast , either relativity is violated or non - standard physics must be occurring outside the stretched event horizon of a black hole . more specifically , either information is being transferred faster than relativity would permit , the information is not carried by the hawking radiation and thus must be carried by unknown physics , or the hawking radiation carries much more information than standard thermodynamics would permit .
