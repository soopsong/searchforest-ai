feasible setup for pulsed quantum non - demolition interaction between two distant mechanical oscillators through optical or microwave mediator is proposed . the proposal uses homodyne measurement of the mediator and feedforward control of the mechanical oscillators to reach the interaction . to verify quantum nature of the interaction , we investigate the gaussian entanglement generated in the mechanical modes . we evaluate it under influence of mechanical bath and propagation loss for the mediator and propose ways to optimize the interaction . finally , both currently available optomechanical and electromechanical platforms are numerically analyzed . the analysis shows that implementation is already feasible with current technology .
