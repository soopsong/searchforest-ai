we study the excitonic dynamics of a driven quantum dot under the influence of a phonon environment , going beyond the weak exciton - phonon coupling approximation . by combining the polaron transform and time - local projection operator techniques we develop a master equation that can be valid over a much larger range of exciton - phonon coupling strengths and temperatures than the standard weak - coupling approach . for the experimentally relevant parameters considered here , we find that the weak - coupling and polaron theories give very similar predictions for low temperatures ( below 30 k ) , while at higher temperatures we begin to see discrepancies between the two . this is due to the fact that , unlike the polaron approach , the weak - coupling theory is incapable of capturing multiphonon effects , while it also does not properly account for phonon - induced renormalisation of the driving frequency . in particular , we find that the weak - coupling theory often overestimates the damping rate when compared to that predicted by the polaron theory . finally , we extend our theory to include non - markovian effects and find that , for the parameters considered here , they have little bearing on the excitonic rabi rotations when plotted as a function of pulse area .
