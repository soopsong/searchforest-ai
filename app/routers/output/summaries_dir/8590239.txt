amplitude damping changes entangled pure states into usually less - entangled mixed states . we show , however , that even local amplitude damping of one or two qubits can result in mixed states more entangled than pure states if one compares the relative entropy of entanglement ( ree ) for a given degree of the bell - clauser - horne - shimony - holt inequality violation ( referred to as nonlocality ) . by applying monte - carlo simulations , we find the maximally entangled mixed states and show that they are likely to be optimal by checking the karush - kuhn - tucker conditions , which generalize the method of lagrange multipliers for this nonlinear optimization problem . we show that the ree for mixed states can exceed that of pure states if the nonlocality is in the range ( 0,0.82 ) and the maximal difference between these rees is 0.4 . a former comparison [ phys . rev . a 78 , 052308 ( 2008 ) ] of the ree for a given negativity showed analogous property but the corresponding maximal difference in the rees is one - order smaller ( i.e. , 0.039 ) and the negativity range is ( 0,0.53 ) only . for appropriate comparison , we normalized the nonlocality measure to be equal to the standard entanglement measures , including the negativity , for arbitrary two - qubit pure states . we also analyze the influence of the phase - damping channel on the entanglement of the initially pure states . we show that the minimum of the ree for a given nonlocality can be achieved by this channel , contrary to the amplitude damping channel .
