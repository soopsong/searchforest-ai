this paper presents a new relativistic symmetrical interpretation ( rsi ) of the dirac equation in ( 1 + 1)d which postulates : quantum mechanics is intrinsically time - symmetric , with no arrow of time ; the fundamental objects of quantum mechanics are transitions ; a transition is fully described by a complex transition amplitude density with specified initial and final boundary conditions ; and transition amplitude densities never collapse . this rsi is compared to the copenhagen interpretation ( ci ) for the analysis of einstein 's bubble experiment with a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle . this rsi can predict the future and retrodict the past , has no zitterbewegung , resolves some inconsistencies of the ci , and eliminates some of the conceptual problems of the ci .
