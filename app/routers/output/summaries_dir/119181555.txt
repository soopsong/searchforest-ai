for the past two decades , researchers have attempted to create a quantum neural network ( qnn ) by combining the merits of quantum computing and neural computing . in order to exploit the advantages of the two prolific fields , the qnn must meet the non - trivial task of integrating the unitary dynamics of quantum computing and the dissipative dynamics of neural computing . at the core of quantum computing and neural computing lies the qubit and perceptron , respectively . we see that past implementations of the quantum perceptron model have failed to fuse the two elegantly . this was due to a slow learning rule and a disregard for the unitary requirement . in this paper , we present a quantum perceptron that can compute functions uncomputable by the classical perceptron while analytically solving for parameters and preserving the unitary and dissipative requirements .
