we compute the holographic entanglement entropy and subregion complexity of spherical boundary subregions in the uncharged and charged ads black hole backgrounds , with the \textbf{change } in these quantities being defined with respect to the pure ads result . this calculation is done perturbatively in the parameter $ \frac{r}{z_{\rm h}}$ , where $ z_{\rm h}$ is the black hole horizon and $ r$ is the radius of the entangling region . we provide analytic formulae for these quantities as functions of the boundary spacetime dimension $ d$ including several orders higher than previously computed . we observe that the change in entanglement entropy has definite sign at each order and subregion complexity has a negative sign relative to entanglement entropy at each of those orders ( except at first order or in three spacetime dimensions , where it vanishes identically ) . we combine pre - existing work on the"complexity equals volume"conjecture and the conjectured relationship between fisher information and bulk entanglement to suggest a refinement of the so - called first law of entanglement thermodynamics by introducing a work term associated with complexity . this extends the previously proposed first law , which held to first order , to one which holds to second order . we note that the proposed relation does not hold to third order and speculate on the existence of additional information - theoretic quantities that may also play a role .
