the negative hydrogen ion is the first three body quantum problem whose ground state energy is calculated using the ` chandrasekhar wavefunction ' that accounts for the electron - electron correlation . solving multi - body systems is a daunting task in quantum mechanics as it includes choosing a trial wavefunction and the calculation of integrals for the system that becomes almost impossible for systems with three or more particles . this difficulty can be addressed by quantum computers . they have emerged as a tool to address different electronic structure problems with remarkable efficiency . they have been realized in various fields and proved their efficiency over classical computers . here , we show the quantum simulation of h^{- } ion to calculate it 's ground state energy in ibm quantum computer . the energy is found to be -0.5339355468 hartree with an error of 0.8376 % as compared to the theoretical value . we observe that the quantum computer is efficient in preparing the correlated wavefunction of h^{- } and calculating it 's ground state energy . we use a recently developed algorithm known as ` variational quantum eigensolver ' and implement it in ibm 's 5-qubit quantum chip ` ibmqx2 ' . the method consists of a quantum part i.e. , state preparation and measurement of expectation values using the quantum computer , and the classical part i.e. , the optimization routine run in a classical computer for energy convergence . an optimization routine is performed on classical computer by running quantum chemistry program and codes in qiskit to converge the energy to the minimum . we also present a comparison of different optimization routines and encoding methods used to converge the energy value to the minimum . the technique can be used to solve various many body problems with great efficiency .
