we consider the quantum analogue of the pattern matching problem , which consists of classifying a given unknown system according to certain predefined pattern classes . we address the problem of quantum template matching in which each pattern class $ { \cal c}_i$ is represented by a known quantum state $ \hat g_i$ called a template state , and our task is to find a template which optimally matches a given unknown quantum state $ \hat f$. we set up a precise formulation of this problem in terms of the optimal strategy for an associated quantum bayesian inference problem . we then investigate various examples of quantum template matching for qubit systems , considering the effect of allowing a finite number of copies of the input state $ \hat f$. we compare quantum optimal matching strategies and semiclassical strategies and demonstrate an entanglement assisted enhancement of performance in the general quantum optimal strategy .
