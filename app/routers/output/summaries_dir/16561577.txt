we study the non - markovian quantum dynamics of an emitter inside an open multimode cavity , focusing on the case where the emitter is resonant with high - frequency cavity modes . based on a green 's function technique suited for open photonic structures , we study the crossovers between three distinct regimes as the coupling strength is gradually increased : ( i ) overdamped decay with a time scale given by the purcell modified decay rate , ( ii ) underdamped oscillations with a time scale given by the effective vacuum rabi frequency , and ( iii ) pulsed revivals . the final multimode strong coupling regime ( iii ) gives rise to quantum revivals of the atomic inversion on a time scale associated with the cavity round - trip time . we show that the crucial parameter to capture the crossovers between these regimes is the nonlinear lamb shift , accounted for exactly in our formalism .
