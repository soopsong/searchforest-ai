we present a general description of topological insulators from the point of view of dirac equations . the z_{2 } index for the dirac equation is always zero , and thus the dirac equation is topologically trivial . after the quadratic b term in momentum is introduced to correct the mass term m or the band gap of the dirac equation , the z_{2 } index is modified as 1 for mb>0 and 0 for mb<0 . for a fixed b there exists a topological quantum phase transition from a topologically trivial system to a non - trivial one system when the sign of mass m changes . a series of solutions near the boundary in the modified dirac equation are obtained , which is characteristic of topological insulator . from the solutions of the bound states and the z_{2 } index we establish a relation between the dirac equation and topological insulators .
