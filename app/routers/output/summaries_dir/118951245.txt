we consider the nonstationary circuit qed architecture in which a single - mode cavity interacts with n>1 identical qubits , and some system parameters undergo a weak external perturbation . it is shown that in the dispersive regime one can engineer the two - photon exchange interaction by adjusting the frequency of harmonic modulation to ( approximately ) $ 2|\delta _ { -}|$ , where $ \delta _ { -}$ is the average atom -- field detuning . closed analytic description is derived for the weak atom - field coupling regime , and numeric simulations indicate that the phenomenon can be observed in the present setups .
