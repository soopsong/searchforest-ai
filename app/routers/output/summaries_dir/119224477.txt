the entangled states that include every physical properties of particles would be important for both theoretical and applied physics . however , the existence and properties of such entangled states are unclear at present . here we theoretically show that a particle - antiparticle pair can form the so - called packaged entangled states which encapsulate all the necessary physical quantities for completely identifying the particles . the particles in the packaged entangled states are indeterminate and exhibit unusual properties . thereafter , we discussed the possible applications of these new entangled states , i.e. , the protocol for teleporting the entire quantum state of a particle ( or an antiparticle ) to an arbitrarily large distance without a classical channel , transfer of the new entangled states from a particle pair to another particle pair , and new interpretation to the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the observable universe .
