in many radar scenarios , the radar target or the medium is assumed to possess randomly varying parts . the properties of a target are described by a random process known as the spreading function . its second order statistics under the wssus assumption are given by the scattering function . recent developments in operator sampling theory suggest novel channel sounding procedures that allow for the determination of the spreading function given complete statistical knowledge of the operator echo from a single sounding by a weighted pulse train . we construct and analyze a novel estimator for the scattering function based on these findings . our results apply whenever the scattering function is supported on a compact subset of the time - frequency plane . we do not make any restrictions either on the geometry of this support set , or on its area . our estimator can be seen as a generalization of an averaged periodogram estimator for the case of a non - rectangular geometry of the support set of the scattering function .
