we present a comprehensive review on the geometric - phase based metasurfaces for orbital angular momentum(oam ) generation and detection . these metasurfaces manipulate the electromagnetic ( em ) wave by introducing abrupt phase change , which is strongly dependent on the polarization state of incident em wave and can be interpreted by geometric phase . hence , the conventional bulk devices that based on the accumulated phase change along the optical path can be avoided .
