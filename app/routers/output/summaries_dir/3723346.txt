quantum bits ( qubits ) are at the heart of quantum information processing schemes . currently , solid - state qubits , and in particular the superconducting ones , seem to satisfy the requirements for being the building blocks of viable quantum computers , since they exhibit relatively long coherence times , extremely low dissipation , and scalability . the possibility of achieving quantum coherence in macroscopic circuits comprising josephson junctions , envisioned by legett in the 1980 's , was demonstrated for the first time in a charge qubit ; since then , the exploitation of macroscopic quantum effects in low - capacitance josephson junction circuits allowed for the realization of several kinds of superconducting qubits . furthermore , coupling between qubits has been successfully achieved that was followed by the construction of multiple - qubit logic gates and the implementation of several algorithms . here it is demonstrated that induced qubit lattice coherence as well as two remarkable quantum coherent optical phenomena , i.e. , self - induced transparency and dicke - type superradiance , may occur during light - pulse propagation in quantum metamaterials comprising superconducting charge qubits . the generated qubit lattice pulse forms a compound"quantum breather"that propagates in synchrony with the electromagnetic pulse . the experimental confirmation of such effects in superconducting quantum metamaterials may open a new pathway to potentially powerful quantum computing .
