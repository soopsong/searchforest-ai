this paper is concerned with a stochastic dissipativity theory using quadratic - exponential storage functions for open quantum systems with canonically commuting dynamic variables governed by quantum stochastic differential equations . the system is linearly coupled to external boson fields and has a quadratic hamiltonian which is perturbed by nonquadratic functions of linear combinations of system variables . such perturbations are similar to those in the classical lur'e systems and make the quantum dynamics nonlinear . we study their effect on the quantum expectation of the exponential of a positive definite quadratic form of the system variables . this allows conditions to be established for the risk - sensitive stochastic storage function of the quantum system to remain bounded , thus securing boundedness for the moments of system variables of arbitrary order . these results employ a noncommutative analogue of the doleans - dade exponential and a multivariate partial differential version of the gronwall - bellman lemma .
