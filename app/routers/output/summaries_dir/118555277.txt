we study the photon blockade of two - photon scattering in a one - dimensional waveguide , which contains two atoms coupled via the rydberg interaction . we obtain the analytic scattering solution of photonic wave packets with the laplace transform method . we examine the photon correlation by addressing the two - photon relative wave function and the second - order correlation function in the single- and two - photon resonance cases . it is found that , under the single - photon resonance condition , photon bunching and antibunching can be observed in the two - photon transmission and reflection , respectively . in particular , the bunching and antibunching effects become stronger with the increasing of the rydberg coupling strength . in addition , we find a phenomenon of bunching - antibunching transition caused by the two - photon resonance .
