superposition , arguably the most fundamental property of quantum mechanics , lies at the heart of quantum information science . however , how to create the superposition of any two unknown pure states remains as a daunting challenge . recently , it is proved that such a quantum protocol does not exist if the two input states are completely unknown , whereas a probabilistic protocol is still available with some prior knowledge about the input states [ m. oszmaniec \emph{et al . } , phys . rev . lett . 116 , 110403 ( 2016 ) ] . the knowledge is that both of the two input states have nonzero overlaps with some given referential state . in this work , we experimentally realize the probabilistic protocol of superposing two pure states in a three - qubit nuclear magnetic resonance system . we demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol by preparing a families of input states , and the average fidelity between the prepared state and expected superposition state is over 99 % . moreover , we experimentally illustrate the limitation of the protocol that it is likely to fail or yields very low fidelity , if the nonzero overlaps are approaching zero . our experimental implementation can be extended to more complex situations and other quantum systems .
