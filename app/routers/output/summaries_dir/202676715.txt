variational hybrid quantum - classical algorithms ( vhqcas ) have the potential to be useful in the era of near - term quantum computing . however , recently there has been concern regarding the number of measurements needed for convergence of vhqcas . here , we address this concern by investigating the classical optimizer in vhqcas . we introduce a novel optimizer called individual coupled adaptive number of shots ( icans ) . this adaptive optimizer frugally selects the number of measurements ( i.e. , number of shots ) both for a given iteration and for a given partial derivative in a stochastic gradient descent . we numerically simulate the performance of icans for the variational quantum eigensolver and for variational quantum compiling , with and without noise . in all cases , and especially in the noisy case , icans tends to out - perform state - of - the - art optimizers for vhqcas . we therefore believe this adaptive optimizer will be useful for realistic vhqca implementations , where the number of measurements is limited .
