a non - markovian model of quantum repeated interactions between a small quantum system and an infinite chain of quantum systems is presented . by adapting and applying usual pro jection operator techniques in this context , discrete versions of the integro - differential and time - convolutioness master equations for the reduced system are derived . next , an intuitive and rigorous description of the indirect quantum measurement principle is developed and a discrete non markovian stochastic master equation for the open system is obtained . finally , the question of unravelling in a particular model of non - markovian quantum interactions is discussed .
