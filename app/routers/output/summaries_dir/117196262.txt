engineering quantum systems offers great opportunities both technologically and scientifically for communication , computation , and simulation . the construction and operation of large scale quantum information devices presents a grand challenge and a major issue is the effective control of coherent dynamics . this is often in the presence of decoherence which further complicates the task of determining the behaviour of the system . here , we show how to determine open system markovian dynamics of a quantum system with restricted initialisation and partial output state information .
