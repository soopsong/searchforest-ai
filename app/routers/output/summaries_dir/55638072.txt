we investigate entanglement between collective operators of two blocks of oscillators in an infinite linear harmonic chain . these operators are defined as averages over local operators ( individual oscillators ) in the blocks . on the one hand , this approach of"physical blocks"meets realistic experimental conditions , where measurement apparatuses do not interact with single oscillators but rather with a whole bunch of them , i.e. , where in contrast to usually studied"mathematical blocks"not every possible measurement is allowed . on the other , this formalism naturally allows the generalization to blocks which may consist of several non - contiguous regions . we quantify entanglement between the collective operators by a measure based on the peres - horodecki criterion and show how it can be extracted and transferred to two qubits . entanglement between two blocks is found even in the case where none of the oscillators from one block is entangled with an oscillator from the other , showing genuine bipartite entanglement between collective operators . allowing the blocks to consist of a periodic sequence of subblocks , we verify that entanglement scales at most with the total boundary region . we also apply the approach of collective operators to scalar quantum field theory .
