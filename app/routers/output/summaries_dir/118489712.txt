this paper concerns the problem of stability for quantum feedback networks . we demonstrate in the context of quantum optics how stability of quantum feedback networks can be guaranteed using only simple gain inequalities for network components and algebraic relationships determined by the network . quantum feedback networks are shown to be stable if the loop gain is less than one - this is an extension of the famous small gain theorem of classical control theory . we illustrate the simplicity and power of the small gain approach with applications to important problems of robust stability and robust stabilization .
