two approaches to describe the thermodynamics of a subsystem that interacts with a thermal bath are considered . within the first approach , the mean system energy $ e_{s}$ is identified with the expectation value of the system hamiltonian , which is evaluated with respect to the overall ( system+bath ) equilibrium distribution . within the second approach , the system partition function $ z_{s}$ is considered as the fundamental quantity , which is postulated to be the ratio of the overall ( system+bath ) and the bath partition functions , and the standard thermodynamic relation $ e_{s}=-d(\ln z_{s})/d\beta$ is used to obtain the mean system energy . % ( $ \beta\equiv 1/(k_{b}t)$ , $ k_{b}$ is the boltzmann constant , % and $ t$ is the temperature ) . employing both classical and quantum mechanical treatments , the advantages and shortcomings of the two approaches are analyzed in detail for various different systems . it is shown that already within classical mechanics both approaches predict significantly different results for thermodynamic quantities provided the system - bath interaction is not bilinear or the system of interest consists of more than a single particle . based on the results , it is concluded that the first approach is superior .
