open quantum random walks ( oqrws ) deal with quantum random motions on the line for systems with internal and orbital degrees of freedom . the internal system behaves as a quantum random gyroscope coding for the direction of the orbital moves . we reveal the existence of a transition , depending on oqrw moduli , in the internal system behaviors from simple oscillations to random flips between two unstable pure states . this induces a transition in the orbital motions from usual diffusion to ballistically induced diffusion with large mean free path and large effective diffusion constant at large time . we also show that mixed states of the internal system are converted into random pure states during the process . we touch upon possible experimental realizations .
