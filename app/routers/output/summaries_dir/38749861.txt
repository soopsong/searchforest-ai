recently two papers [ k. jacobs , phys . rev . a { \bf 67 } , 030301(r ) ( 2003 ) ; h. m. wiseman and j. f. ralph , new j. physics { \bf 8 } , 90 ( 2006 ) ] have derived control strategies for rapid purification of qubits , optimized with respect to various goals . in the former paper the proof of optimality was not mathematically rigorous , while the latter gave only heuristic arguments for optimality . in this paper we provide rigorous proofs of optimality in all cases , by applying simple concepts from optimal control theory , including bellman equations and verification theorems .
