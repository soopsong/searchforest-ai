in this paper , we first demonstrate how to realize quantum state transferring ( qst ) from one atom to another based on quantum zeno dynamics . then , the qst protocol is generalized to realize the quantum state swapping ( qss ) between two arbitrary atoms with the help of a third one . furthermore , we also consider the qss within a quantum network . the influence of decoherence is analyzed by numerical calculation . the results demonstrate that the protocols are robust against cavity decay .
