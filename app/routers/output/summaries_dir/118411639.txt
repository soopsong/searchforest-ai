in this article we consider the second law of black holes ( and other causal horizons ) in theories where the gravitational action is an arbitrary function of the lovelock densities . we show that there exists an entropy which increases locally , for linearized perturbations to regular killing horizons . in addition to a classical increase theorem , we also prove a generalized second law for semiclassical , minimally - coupled matter fields .
