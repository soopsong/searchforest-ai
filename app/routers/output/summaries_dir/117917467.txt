we describe a scheme for entangling mechanical resonators which is efficient also beyond the resolved sideband regime . it employs the radiation pressure force of the squeezed light produced by a degenerate optical parametric oscillator , which acts as a reservoir of quantum correlations ( squeezed reservoir ) , and it is effective when the spectral bandwidth of the reservoir and the fields frequencies are appropriately selected . it allows for the steady state preparation of mechanical resonatrs in entangled epr states and can be extended to the preparation of many entangled pairs of resonators which interact with the same light field , in a situation in which the optomechanical system realizes a star - like harmonic network .
