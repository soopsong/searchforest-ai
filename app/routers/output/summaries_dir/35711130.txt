we study the adiabatic response of open systems governed by lindblad evolutions . in such systems , there is an ambiguity in the assignment of observables to fluxes ( rates ) such as velocities and currents . for the appropriate notion of flux , the formulas for the transport coefficients are simple and explicit and are governed by the parallel transport on the manifold of instantaneous stationary states . among our results we show that the response coefficients of open systems , whose stationary states are projections , is given by the adiabatic curvature .
