we propose a practical approach to manipulate the counter - rotating ( cr ) interactions in the quantum rabi model by introducing a sinusoidal modulation to the transition frequency of the quantum two - level system in this model . by choosing appropriate modulation frequency and amplitude , enhancement and suppression of the cr interactions can be achieved in the jaynes - cummings regime ( including both weak- and strong - coupling cases ) as well as the ultrastrong - coupling regime . in particular , we calculate the output photon emission of the cavity vacuum state under enhanced cr terms . our results show that continuous and steady photon emission from the cavity vacuum can be observed in the jaynes - cummings regime as a consequence of this enhancement . our approach can be realized in superconducting quantum circuits .
