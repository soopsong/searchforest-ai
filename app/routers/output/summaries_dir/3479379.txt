using the information geometry approach , we determine the volume of the set of two - qubit states with maximally disordered subsystems . particular attention is devoted to the behavior of the volume of sub - manifolds of separable and entangled states with fixed purity . we show that the usage of the classical fisher metric on phase space probability representation of quantum states gives the same qualitative results with respect to different versions of the quantum fisher metric .
