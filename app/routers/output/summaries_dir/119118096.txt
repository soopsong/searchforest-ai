bipartite maximally entangled states have the property that the largest schmidt coefficient reaches its lower bound . however , for multipartite states the standard schmidt decomposition generally does not exist . we use a generalized schmidt decomposition and the geometric measure of entanglement to characterize three - qubit pure states and derive a single - parameter family of maximally entangled three - qubit states . the paradigmatic greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) and w states emerge as extreme members in this family of maximally entangled states . this family of states possess different trends of entanglement behavior : in going from ghz to w states the geometric measure and the relative entropy of entanglement and the bipartite entanglement all increase monotonically whereas the three - tangle and bi - partition negativity both decrease monotonically .
