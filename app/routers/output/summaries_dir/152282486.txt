it is often the case that the environment of a quantum system may be described as a bath of oscillators with ohmic density of states . in turn , the precise characterization of these classes of environments is a crucial tool to engineer decoherence or to tailor quantum information protocols . recently , the use of quantum probes in characterizing ohmic environments at zero - temperature has been discussed , showing that a single qubit provides precise estimation of the cutoff frequency . on the other hand , thermal noise often spoil quantum probing schemes , and for this reason we here extend the analysis to complex system at thermal equilibrium . in particular , we discuss the interplay between thermal fluctuations and time evolution in determining the precision { attainable by } quantum probes . our results show that the presence of thermal fluctuations degrades the precision for low values of the cutoff frequency , i.e. values of the order $ \omega_c \lesssim t$ ( in natural units ) . for larger values of $ \omega_c$ decoherence is mostly due to the structure of environment , rather than thermal fluctuations , such that quantum probing by a single qubit is still an effective estimation procedure .
