conventional glauber coherent states ( cs ) can be defined in several equivalent ways , e.g. , by displacing the vacuum or , explicitly , by their infinite poissonian expansion in fock states . it is well known that these definitions become inequivalent if applied to finite $ d$-level systems ( qudits ) . we present a comparative wigner - function description of the qudit cs defined ( i ) by the action of the truncated displacement operator on the vacuum and ( ii ) by the poissonian expansion in fock states of the glauber cs truncated at $ ( d-1)$-photon fock state . these states can be generated from a classical light by its optical truncation using nonlinear and linear quantum scissors devices , respectively . we show a surprising effect that a macroscopically distinguishable superposition of two qudit cs ( according to both definitions ) can be generated with high fidelity by displacing the vacuum in the qudit hilbert space . if the qudit dimension $ d$ is even ( odd ) then the superposition state contains fock states with only odd ( even ) photon numbers , which can be referred to as the odd ( even ) qudit cs or the female ( male ) schr\"odinger cat state . this phenomenon can be interpreted as an interference of a single cs with its reflection from the highest - energy fock state of the hilbert space , as clearly seen via phase - space interference of the wigner function . we also analyze nonclassical properties of the qudit cs including their photon - number statistics and nonclassical volume of the wigner function , which is a quantitative parameter of nonclassicality ( quantumness ) of states . finally , we study optical tomograms , which can be directly measured in the homodyne detection of the analyzed qudit cat states and enable the complete reconstructions of their wigner functions .
