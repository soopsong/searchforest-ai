adaptive response to a varying environment is a common feature of biological organisms . reproducing such features in electronic systems and circuits is of great importance for a variety of applications . here , we consider memory models inspired by an intriguing ability of slime molds to both memorize the period of temperature and humidity variations , and anticipate the next variations to come , when appropriately trained . effective circuit models of such behavior are designed using i ) a set of lc - contours with memristive damping , and ii ) a single memcapacitive system - based adaptive contour with memristive damping . we consider these two approaches in detail by comparing their results and predictions . finally , possible biological experiments that would discriminate between the models are discussed . in this work , we also introduce an effective description of certain memory circuit elements .
