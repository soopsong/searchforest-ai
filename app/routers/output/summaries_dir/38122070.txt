a notion of asymmetric quantum dialogue ( aqd ) is introduced . conventional protocols of quantum dialogue are essentially symmetric as both the users ( alice and bob ) can encode the same amount of classical information . in contrast , the scheme for aqd introduced here provides different amount of communication powers to alice and bob . the proposed scheme , offers an architecture , where the entangled state and the encoding scheme to be shared between alice and bob depends on the amount of classical information they want to exchange with each other . the general structure for the aqd scheme has been obtained using a group theoretic structure of the operators introduced in ( shukla et al . , phys . lett . a , 377 ( 2013 ) 518 ) . the effect of different types of noises ( e.g. , amplitude damping and phase damping noise ) on the proposed scheme is investigated , and it is shown that the proposed aqd is robust and uses optimized amount of quantum resources .
