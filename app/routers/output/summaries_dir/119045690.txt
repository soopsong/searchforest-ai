in this article the robustness of tripartite greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) and w states is investigated against dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( i.e. dm ) interaction . we consider a closed system of three qubits and an environmental qubit . the environmental qubit interacts with any one of the three qubits through dm interaction . the tripartite system is initially prepared in ghz and w states respectively . the composite four qubits system evolve with unitary dynamics . we detach the environmental qubit by tracing out from four qubits and profound impact of dm interaction is studied on the initial entanglement of the system . as a result we find that the bipartite partitions of w states suffer from entanglement sudden death ( i.e. esd ) , while tripartite entanglement does not . on the other hand bipartite partitions and tripartite entanglement in ghz states does not feel any influence of dm interaction . so , we find that ghz states have robust character than w states . in this work we consider generalised ghz and w states and three $ \pi$ is used as an entanglement measure . this study can be useful in quantum information processing where unwanted dm interaction takes place .
