a quantum system $ \s$ interacts in a successive way with elements $ \ee$ of a chain of identical independent quantum subsystems . each interaction lasts for a duration $ \tau$ and is governed by a fixed coupling between $ \s$ and $ \ee$. we show that the system , initially in any state close to a reference state , approaches a { \it repeated interaction asymptotic state } in the limit of large times . this state is $ \tau$--periodic in time and does not depend on the initial state . if the reference state is chosen so that $ \s$ and $ \ee$ are individually in equilibrium at positive temperatures , then the repeated interaction asymptotic state satisfies an average second law of thermodynamics .
