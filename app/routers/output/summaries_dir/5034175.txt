we report on coherent and multi - temporal mode storage of light using the full atomic frequency comb memory scheme . the scheme involves the transfer of optical atomic excitations in pr3+:y2sio5 to spin - waves in the hyperfine levels using strong single - frequency transfer pulses . using this scheme , a total of 5 temporal modes are stored and recalled on - demand from the memory . the coherence of the storage and retrieval is characterized using a time - bin interference measurement resulting in visibilities higher than 80 % , independent of the storage time . this coherent and multimode spin - wave memory is promising as a quantum memory for light .
