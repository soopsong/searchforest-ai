we present a numerical study comparing semiclassical and quantum models of a damped , strongly interacting cavity qed system composed of a single two - level atom interacting with a single quantized cavity mode driven externally by a tunable monochromatic field . we compute the steady state transmission spectrum of the coupled system under each model and show that in the strong coupling regime , the two models yield starkly different results . the fully quantum mechanical model of the system correctly yields the expected multiphoton transmission spectra while the semiclassical approach results in a bistable spectrum .
