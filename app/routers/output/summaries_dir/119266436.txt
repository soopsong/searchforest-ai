a general approach to study the hierarchical quantum information splitting ( hqis ) is proposed and the same is used to systematically investigate the possibility of realizing hqis using different classes of 4-qubit entangled states that are not connected by slocc . explicit examples of hqis using 4-qubit cluster state and 4-qubit |\omega > state are provided . further , the proposed hqis scheme is generalized to introduce two new aspects of hierarchical quantum communication . to be precise , schemes of probabilistic hierarchical quantum information splitting and hierarchical quantum secret sharing are obtained by modifying the proposed hqis scheme . a number of practical situations where hierarchical quantum communication would be of use are also presented .
