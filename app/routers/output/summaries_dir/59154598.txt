we investigate the possibility to generate quantum - correlated quasi - particles utilizing analogue gravity systems . the quantumness of these correlations is a key aspect of analogue gravity effects and their presence allows for a clear separation between classical and quantum analogue gravity effects . however , experiments in analogue systems , such as bose - einstein condensates , and shallow water waves , are always conducted at non - ideal conditions , in particular , one is dealing with dispersive media at nonzero temperatures . we analyze the influence of the initial temperature on the entanglement generation in analogue gravity phenomena . we lay out all the necessary steps to calculate the entanglement generated between quasi - particle modes and we analytically derive an upper bound on the maximal temperature at which given modes can still be entangled . we further investigate a mechanism to enhance the quantum correlations . as a particular example we analyze the robustness of the entanglement creation against thermal noise in a sudden quench of an ideally homogeneous bose - einstein condensate , taking into account the super - sonic dispersion relations .
