we address both theoretically and experimentally the generation of pulsed non - gaussian states from classical gaussian ones by means of conditional measurements . the setup relies on a beam splitter and a pair of linear photodetectors able to resolve up to tens of photons in the two outputs . we show the reliability of the setup and the good agreement with the theory for a single - mode thermal field entering the beam splitter and present a thorough characterization of the photon statistics of the conditional states .
