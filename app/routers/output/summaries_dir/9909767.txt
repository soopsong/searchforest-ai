we consider an ensemble of quantum systems whose average evolution is described by a density matrix , solution of a lindblad - kossakowski differential equation . we focus on the special case where the decoherence is only due to a highly unstable excited state and where the spontaneously emitted photons are measured by a photo - detector . we propose a systematic method to eliminate the fast and asymptotically stable dynamics associated to the excited state in order to obtain another differential equation for the slow part . we show that this slow differential equation is still of lindblad - kossakowski type , that the decoherence terms and the measured output depend explicitly on the amplitudes of quasi - resonant applied field , i.e. , the control . beside a rigorous proof of the slow / fast ( adiabatic ) reduction based on singular perturbation theory , we also provide a physical interpretation of the result in the context of coherence population trapping via dark states and decoherence - free subspaces . numerical simulations illustrate the accuracy of the proposed approximation for a 5-level systems .
