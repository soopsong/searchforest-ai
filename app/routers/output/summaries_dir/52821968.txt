a quantum thermal transistor is designed by the strong coupling between one qubit and one qutrit which are in contact with three heat baths with different temperatures . the thermal behavior is analyzed based on the master equation by both the numerical and the approximately analytic methods . it is shown that the thermal transistor , as a three - terminal device , allows a weak modulation heat current ( at the modulation terminal ) to switch on / off and effectively modulate the heat current between the other two terminals . in particular , the weak modulation heat current can induce the strong heat current between the other two terminals with the multiple - region amplification of heat current . furthermore , the heat currents are quite robust to the temperature ( current ) fluctuation at the lower - temperature terminal within certain range of temperature , so it can behave as a heat current stabilizer .
