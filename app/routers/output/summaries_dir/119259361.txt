we start a series of studies of the excitation of an optical target by quantum light . in this first part , we introduce the problematic and address the first case of interest , that of exciting the quantum harmonic oscillator , corresponding to , e.g. , a single - mode passive cavity or a non - interacting bosonic field . we introduce a mapping of the hilbert space that allows to chart usefully the accessible regions . we then consider the quantum excitation from single photon sources in the form of a two - level system under various regimes of ( classical ) pumping : incoherent , coherent and in the mollow triplet regime . we close this first opus with an overview of the material to be covered in the subsequent papers .
