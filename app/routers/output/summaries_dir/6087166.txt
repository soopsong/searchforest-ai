an on - demand single - photon source is a key requirement for scaling many optical quantum technologies . a promising approach to realize an on - demand single - photon source is to multiplex an array of heralded single - photon sources using an active optical switching network . however , the performance of multiplexed sources is degraded by photon loss in the optical components and the non - unit detection efficiency of the heralding detectors . we provide a theoretical description of a general multiplexed single - photon source with lossy components and derive expressions for the output probabilities of single - photon emission and multi - photon contamination . we apply these expressions to three specific multiplexing source architectures and consider their tradeoffs in design and performance . to assess the effect of lossy components on near- and long - term experimental goals , we simulate the multiplexed sources when used for many - photon state generation under various amounts of component loss . we find that with a multiplexed source composed of switches with ~0.2 - 0.4 db loss and high efficiency number - resolving detectors , a single - photon source capable of efficiently producing 20 - 40 photon states with low multi - photon contamination is possible , offering the possibility of unlocking new classes of experiments and technologies .
