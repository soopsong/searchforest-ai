we propose a set of subradiant states which can be prepared and detected in a one - dimensional optical lattice . we find that the decay rates are highly dependent on the spatial phases imprinted on the atomic chain , which gives systematic investigations of the subradiance in the fluorescence experiments . the time evolution of these states can have long decay time where up to hundred milliseconds of lifetime is predicted for one hundred atoms . they can also show decayed rabi - like oscillations with a beating frequency determined by the difference of cooperative lamb shift in the subspace . experimental requirements are also discussed for practical implementation of the subradiant states . our proposal provides a novel scheme for quantum storage of photons in arrays of two - level atoms through the preparation and detection of subradiant states , which offer opportunities for quantum many - body state preparation and quantum information processing in optical lattices .
