this paper considers the problem of constructing a distributed direct coupling quantum observer for a closed linear quantum system . the proposed distributed observer consists of a network of quantum harmonic oscillators and it is shown that the distributed observer converges to a consensus in a time averaged sense in which each component of the observer estimates the specified output of the quantum plant . an example and simulations are included to illustrate the properties of the distributed observer .
