we consider the problem of correcting the errors incurred from sending quantum information through a noisy quantum environment by using classical information obtained from a measurement on the environment . for discrete time markovian evolutions , in the case of fixed measurement on the environment , we give criteria for quantum information to be perfectly corrigible and characterize the related feedback . then we analyze the case when perfect correction is not possible and , in the qubit case , we find optimal feedback maximizing the channel fidelity .
