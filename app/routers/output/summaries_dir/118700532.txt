we propose and demonstrate experimentally a scheme to create entangled history states of the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) type . in our experiment , the polarization states of a single photon at three different times are prepared as a ghz entangled history state . we define a ghz functional which attains a maximum value $ 1 $ on the ideal ghz entangled history state and is bounded above by $ 1/16 $ for any three - time history state lacking tripartite entanglement . we have measured the ghz functional on a state we have prepared experimentally , yielding a value of $ 0.656\pm 0.005 $ , clearly demonstrating the contribution of entangled histories .
