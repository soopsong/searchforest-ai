implementing nonlocal unitary operators is an important and hard question in quantum computing and cryptography . we show that any bipartite nonlocal unitary operator of schmidt rank three on the $ ( d_a \times d_b)$-dimensional system is locally equivalent to a controlled unitary when $ d_a$ is at most three . this operator can be locally implemented assisted by a maximally entangled state of schmidt rank $ r=\min\{d_a^2,d_b\}$. we further show that stochastic - equivalent nonlocal unitary operators are indeed locally equivalent , and propose a sufficient condition on which nonlocal and controlled unitary operators are locally equivalent . we also provide the solution to a special case of a conjecture on the ranks of multipartite quantum states .
