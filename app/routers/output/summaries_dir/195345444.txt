to implement fault - tolerant quantum computation with continuous variables , continuous variables need to be digitized using an appropriate code such as the gottesman -- kitaev -- preskill ( gkp ) qubit . we have developed a method to alleviate the required squeezing level to realize fault - tolerant quantum computation with the gkp qubit [ k. fukui , a. tomita , a. okamoto , and k. fujii , phys . rev . x { \bf 8 } , 021054 ( 2018 ) ] . in the previous work , the required squeezing level can be reduced to less than 10 db , assuming a noise derived from only the deviation of the gkp qubit itself . considering realistic devices such as the two - qubit gate and the homodyne measurement , however , there is some additional noise , which leads to the degradation of the squeezing level . specifically , the required squeezing level degrades to 15.0 db , assuming the transmission loss in the homodyne measurement 5 $ \%$ and the imperfection of the two - qubit gate . in this work , we propose a scheme to improve the required squeezing level , combining the previous schemes with the proposed maximum - likelihood methods and encoded measurements . the numerical calculations show that the required squeezing levels are 8.2 , 9.6 , and 11.7 db for the transmission loss in the homodyne measurement 0 , 5 , and 10 $ \%$ , respectively , considering the imperfection of the two - qubit gate . hence , we believe this work will open up a new way to implement continuous - variable fault - tolerant quantum computation with a moderate squeezing level and realistically noisy devices .
