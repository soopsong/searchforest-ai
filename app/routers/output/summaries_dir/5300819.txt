quantum key distributions ( qkd ) systems often rely on polarization of light for encoding , thus limiting the amount of information that can be sent per photon and placing tight bounds on the error that such a system can tolerate . here we describe a proof - of - principle experiment that indicates the feasibility of high - dimensional qkd based on the transverse structure of the light field , allowing for the transfer of more than 1 bit per photon . our implementation uses the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of photons and the corresponding mutually unbiased basis of angular position ( ang ) . our experiment uses a digital micro - mirror device for the rapid generation of oam and ang modes at 4 khz , and a mode sorter capable of sorting single photons based on their oam and ang content with a separation efficiency of 93\% . through the use of a 7-dimensional alphabet encoded in the oam and ang bases , we achieve a channel capacity of 2.05 bits per sifted photon . our experiment shows that , in addition to having an increased information capacity , qkd systems based on spatial - mode encoding will be more tolerant to errors and thus more robust against eavesdropping attacks .
