photonic quantum computing is one of the leading approaches to universal quantum computation . however , large - scale implementation of photonic quantum computing has been hindered by its intrinsic difficulties , such as probabilistic entangling gates for photonic qubits and lack of scalable ways to build photonic circuits . here we discuss how to overcome these limitations by taking advantage of two key ideas which have recently emerged . one is a hybrid qubit - continuous variable approach for realizing a deterministic universal gate set for photonic qubits . the other is time - domain multiplexing technique to perform arbitrarily large - scale quantum computing without changing the configuration of photonic circuits . these ideas together will enable scalable implementation of universal photonic quantum computers in which hardware - efficient error correcting codes can be incorporated . furthermore , all - optical implementation of such systems can increase the operational bandwidth beyond thz in principle , utimately enabling large - scale fault - tolerant universal quantum computers with ultra - high operation frequency .
