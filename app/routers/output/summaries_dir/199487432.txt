the pure entangled state is of vital importance in the field of quantum information . the process of asymptotically extracting pure entangled states from many copies of mixed states via local operations and classical communication is called entanglement distillation . the entanglement distillability problem , which is a long - standing open problem , asks whether such process exists . the 2-copy undistillability of $ 4\times4 $ undistillable werner states has been reduced to the validness of the a matrix inequality , that is , the sum of the squares of the largest two singular values of matrix $ a\otimes i + i \otimes b$ does not exceed $ ( 3d-4)/d^2 $ with $ a , b$ traceless $ d\times d$ matrices and $ ||a||_f^2+||b||_f^2=1 / d$ when $ d=4$. the latest progress , made by { \l}.~pankowski~ et al~[ieee trans . inform . theory , 56 , 4085 ( 2010 ) ] , shows that this conjecture holds when both matrices $ a$ and $ b$ are normal . in this paper , we prove that the conjecture holds when one of matrices $ a$ and $ b$ is normal and the other one is arbitrary . our work makes solid progress towards this conjecture and thus the distillability problem .
