we describe a new error reconciliation protocol { \it winnow } based on the exchange of parity and hamming 's ` ` syndrome ' ' for $ n-$bit subunits of a large data set . { \it winnow } was developed in the context of quantum key distribution and offers significant advantages and net higher efficiency compared to other widely used protocols within the quantum cryptography community . a detailed mathematical analysis of winnow is presented in the context of practical implementations of quantum key distribution ; in particular , the information overhead required for secure implementation is one of the most important criteria in the evaluation of a particular error reconciliation protocol . the increase in efficiency for winnow is due largely to the reduction in authenticated public communication required for its implementation .
