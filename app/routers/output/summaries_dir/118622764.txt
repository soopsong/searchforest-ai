we have recently presented a collision - model - based framework to approach non - markovian quantum dynamics [ ciccarello f palma g m and giovannetti v 2013 phys . rev . a 87 , 040103(r ) ] . as a distinctive feature , memory is introduced in a dynamical way by adding extra inter - ancillary collisions to a standard ( memoryless ) collision model . here , we focus on the case where such intra - bath collisions are described by incoherent partial swap operations . after briefly reviewing the model , we show how to include temperature as an additional parameter by relaxing the assumption that each bath ancilla is initially in a pure state . we also calculate explicitly the dynamical map entailed by the master equation in the paradigmatic instance of a jaynes - cummings system - ancilla coupling .
