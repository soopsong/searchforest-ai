coherent conversion of microwave and optical photons in the single - quantum level can significantly expand our ability to process signals in various fields . efficient up - conversion of a feeble signal in the microwave domain to the optical domain will lead to quantum - noise - limited microwave amplifiers . coherent exchange between optical photons and microwave photons will also be a stepping stone to realize long - distance quantum communication . here we demonstrate bidirectional and coherent conversion between microwave and light using collective spin excitations in a ferromagnet . the converter consists of two harmonic oscillator modes , a microwave cavity mode and a magnetostatic mode called kittel mode , where microwave photons and magnons in the respective modes are strongly coupled and hybridized . an itinerant microwave field and a travelling optical field can be coupled through the hybrid system , where the microwave field is coupled to the hybrid system through the cavity mode , while the optical field addresses the hybrid system through the kittel mode via faraday and inverse faraday effects . the conversion efficiency is theoretically analyzed and experimentally evaluated . the possible schemes for improving the efficiency are also discussed .
