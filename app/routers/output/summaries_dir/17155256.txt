the purpose of this paper is to determine quantum master and filter equations for systems coupled to fields in certain non - classical continuous - mode states . specifically , we consider two types of field states ( i ) single photon states , and ( ii ) superpositions of coherent states . the system and field are described using a quantum stochastic unitary model . master equations are derived from this model and are given in terms of systems of coupled equations . the output field carries information about the system , and is continuously monitored . the quantum filters are determined with the aid of an embedding of the system into a larger non - markovian system , and are given by a system of coupled stochastic differential equations .
