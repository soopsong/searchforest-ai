we present a review and discussions on characterizations and quantifications of macroscopic quantum states as well as their implementations and applications in optical systems . we compare and criticize different measures proposed to define and quantify macroscopic quantum superpositions and extend such comparisons to several types of optical quantum states actively considered for experimental implementations within recent research topics .
