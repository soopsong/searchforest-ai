we put forward a new highly efficient source of paired photons entangled in polarization with an ultra - large bandwidth . the photons are generated by means of a conveniently designed spontaneous parametric down - conversion process in a semiconductor type - ii bragg reflection waveguide . the proposed scheme aims at being a key element of an integrated source of polarization - entangled photon pairs highly suitable for its use in a multi - user quantum - key - distribution system .
