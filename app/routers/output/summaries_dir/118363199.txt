a method is presented to transfer a system of two - level atoms from a spin coherent state to a maximally spin squeezed dicke state , relevant for quantum metrology and quantum information processing . the initial state is the ground state of an initial linear hamiltonian which is gradually turned into a final quadratic hamiltonian whose ground state is the selected dicke state . we use compensating operators to suppress diabatic transitions to unwanted states that would occur if the change were not slow . we discuss the possibilities of constructing the compensating operators by sequential application of quadratic hamiltonians available in experiments .
