many - body physics is traditionally concerned with systems of interacting massive particles . recent studies of effective interactions between photons , induced in the circuit qed architecture by coupling the microwave field to superconducting qubits , have paved the way for photon - based many - body physics . we derive the magnitude and intrinsic signs of photon hopping amplitudes in such circuit qed arrays . for a finite , ring - shaped jaynes - cummings lattice exposed to a synthetic gauge field we show that degeneracies in the single - excitation spectrum emerge , which can give rise to strong correlations for the interacting system with multiple excitations . we calculate the homodyne transmission for such a device , explain the generalization of vacuum rabi splittings known for the single - site jaynes - cummings model , and identify fingerprints of interactions beyond the linear response regime .
