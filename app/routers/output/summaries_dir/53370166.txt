we describe methods for fast production of highly coherent - spin - squeezed many - body states in bosonic josephson junctions ( bjjs ) . we start from the known mapping of the two - site bose - hubbard ( bh ) hamiltonian to that of a single effective particle evolving according to a schr\"odinger - like equation in fock space . since , for repulsive interactions , the effective potential in fock space is nearly parabolic , we extend recently derived protocols for shortcuts to adiabatic evolution in harmonic potentials to the many - body bh hamiltonian . the best scaling of the squeezing parameter for large number of atoms n is \xi^2_s ~ 1 / n .
