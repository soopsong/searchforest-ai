we consider pairs of quantum observables ( povms ) and analyze the relation between the notions of non - disturbance , joint measurability and commutativity . we specify conditions under which these properties coincide or differ --- depending for instance on the interplay between the number of outcomes and the hilbert space dimension or on algebraic properties of the effect operators . we also show that ( non-)disturbance is in general not a symmetric relation and that it can be decided and quantified by means of a semidefinite program .
