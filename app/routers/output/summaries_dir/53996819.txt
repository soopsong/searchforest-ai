a periodically driven quantum system with avoided - level crossing experiences both non - adiabatic transitions and wave - function phase changes . these result in coherent interference fringes in the system 's occupation probabilities . for qubits , with repelling energy levels , such interference , named after landau - zener - stuckelberg - majorana , displays arc - shaped resonance lines . we demonstrate that in the case of a multi - level system with an avoided - level crossing of the two lower levels , the shape of the resonances can change from convex arcs to concave heart - shaped and harp - shaped resonance lines . in this way , the shape of such resonance fringes is defined by the whole spectrum , providing insight on the slow - frequency system spectroscopy . as a particular example , we consider this for valley - orbit silicon quantum dots .
