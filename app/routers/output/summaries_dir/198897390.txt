out - of - time - ordered correlators ( otocs ) have been proposed as a tool to witness quantum information scrambling in many - body system dynamics . these correlators can be understood as averages over nonclassical multi - time quasi - probability distributions ( qpds ) . these qpds have more information , and their nonclassical features witness quantum information scrambling in a more nuanced way . however , their high dimensionality and nonclassicality make qpds challenging to measure experimentally . we focus on the topical case of a many - qubit system and show how to obtain such a qpd in the laboratory using circuits with three and four sequential measurements . averaging distinct values over the same measured distribution reveals either the otoc or parameters of its qpd . stronger measurements minimize experimental resources despite increased dynamical disturbance .
