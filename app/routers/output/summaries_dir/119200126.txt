we present a multipartite entanglement purification scheme in a greenberger - horne - zeilinger state for electrons based on their spins and their charges . this scheme works for purification with two steps , i.e. , bit - flipping error correction and phase - error flip error correction . by repeating these two steps , the parties in quantum communication can get some high - fidelity multipartite entangled electronic systems .
