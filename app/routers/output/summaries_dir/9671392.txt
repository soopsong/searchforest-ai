a mean function in a reproducing kernel hilbert space ( rkhs ) , or a kernel mean , is central to kernel methods in that it is used by many classical algorithms such as kernel principal component analysis , and it also forms the core inference step of modern kernel methods that rely on embedding probability distributions in rkhss . given a finite sample , an empirical average has been used commonly as a standard estimator of the true kernel mean . despite a widespread use of this estimator , we show that it can be improved thanks to the well - known stein phenomenon . we propose a new family of estimators called kernel mean shrinkage estimators ( kmses ) , which benefit from both theoretical justifications and good empirical performance . the results demonstrate that the proposed estimators outperform the standard one , especially in a"large d , small n"paradigm .
