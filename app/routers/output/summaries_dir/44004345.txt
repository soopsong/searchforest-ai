signed networks have been a topic of recent interest in the network control community as they allow studying antagonistic interactions in multi - agent systems . although dynamical characteristics of signed networks have been well - studied , notions such as controllability and stabilizability for signed networks for protocols such as consensus are missing in the literature . classically , graph automorphisms with respect to the input nodes have been used to characterize uncontrollability of consensus networks . in this paper , we show that in addition to the graph symmetry , the topological property of structural balance facilitates the derivation of analogous sufficient conditions for uncontrollability for signed networks . in particular , we provide an analysis which shows that a gauge transformation induced by structural balance allows symmetry arguments to hold for signed consensus networks . lastly , we use fractional automorphisms to extend our observations to output controllability and stabilizability of signed networks .
