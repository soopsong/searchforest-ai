recurrence in the classical random walk is well known and described by the p\'olya number . for quantum walks , recurrence is similarly understood in terms of the probability of a localized quantum walker to return to its origin . under certain circumstances the quantum walker may also return to an arbitrary initial quantum state in a finite number of steps . quantum state revivals in quantum walks on circles using coin operators which are constant in time and uniform across the path have been described before but only incompletely . in this paper we find the general conditions for which full - quantum state revival will occur .
