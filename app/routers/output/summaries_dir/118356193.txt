the class of local invertible operations is defined and the invariance of entanglement under such operations is established . for the quantification of entanglement , universal entanglement measures are defined , which are invariant under local invertible transformations . they quantify entanglement in a very general sense . it is shown that the schmidt number is a universal entanglement measure , which is most important for the general amount of entanglement . for special applications , pseudo - measures are defined to quantify the useful entanglement for a certain quantum task . the entanglement quantification is further specified by operational measures , which include the accessible observables by a given experimental setup .
