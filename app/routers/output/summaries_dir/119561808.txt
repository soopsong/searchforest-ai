we give an efficient algorithm to evaluate a certain class of exponential sums , namely the periodic , quadratic , multivariate half gauss sums . we show that these exponential sums become $ \#\mathsf{p}$-hard to compute when we omit either the periodic or quadratic condition . we apply our results about these exponential sums to the classical simulation of quantum circuits and give an alternative proof of the gottesman - knill theorem . we also explore a connection between these exponential sums and the holant framework . in particular , we generalize the existing definition of affine signatures to arbitrary dimensions and use our results about half gauss sums to show that the holant problem for the set of affine signatures is tractable .
