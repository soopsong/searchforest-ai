we show that certain coherences , termed as heat - exchange coherences , which contribute to the thermalization process of a quantum probe in a repeated interactions scheme , can be extracted from the power spectrum of the probe system . we suggest to use the power spectrum as a way to assess the apparent temperature of non - thermal atomic clusters carrying such coherences and also prove that it is useful to measure the corresponding thermalization time of the probe . we explore this idea in two examples in which the probe is assumed to be a single - qubit and a single - cavity field mode . moreover , for the single - qubit case , we show how it is possible to perform a robust quantum simulation of resonance fluorescence using such repeated interactions scheme with clusters carrying different class of coherences .
