recent theoretical and experimental studies have shown significance of quantum information scrambling ( i.e. a spread of quantum information over a system degrees of freedom ) for problems encountered in high - energy physics , quantum information , and condensed matter . due to complexity of quantum many - body systems it is plausible that new developments in this field will be achieved by experimental explorations . since noise effects are inevitably present in experimental implementations , a better theoretical understanding of quantum information scrambling in systems affected by noise is needed . to address this problem we study indicators of quantum scrambling -- out - of - time - ordered correlation functions ( otocs ) in open quantum systems . as most experimental protocols for measuring otocs are based on backward time evolution we consider two possible scenarios of joint system - environment dynamics reversal : in the first one the evolution of the environment is reversed , whereas in the second it is not . we derive general formulas for otocs in those cases as well as study in detail the model of a spin chain coupled to the environment of harmonic oscillators . in the latter case we derive expressions for open systems otocs in terms of feynman - vernon influence functional . subsequently , assuming that dephasing dominates over dissipation , we provide bounds on open system otocs and illustrate them for a spectral density known from the spin - boson problem . in addition to being significant for quantum information scrambling , our results also advance understating of decoherence in processes involving backward time evolution .
