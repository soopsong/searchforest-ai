criteria are given by which dissipative evolution in the weak coupling limit can transfer populations and coherences between quantum subspaces , without a loss of coherence . the result is a form of quantum error correction implemented by the joint evolution of a system with a cold bath . it requires no external intervention and , in principle , no ancilla . an example of such a system , consisting of three dipole ordered spin 1/2 particles in a resonator , is given . the qubit , or the triple quantum coherence of the spins , is protected against all spin - flip errors .
