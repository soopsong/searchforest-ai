nonreciprocal devices that permit wave transmission in only one direction are indispensible in many fields of science including , e.g. , electronics , optics , acoustics , and thermodynamics . manipulating phonons using such nonreciprocal devices may have a range of applications such as phonon diodes , transistors , switches , etc . one way of achieving nonreciprocal phononic devices is to use materials with strong nonlinear response to phonons . however , it is not easy to obtain the required strong mechanical nonlinearity , especially for few - phonon situations . here , we present a general mechanism to amplify nonlinearity using $ \mathcal{pt}$-symmetric structures , and show that an on - chip micro - scale phonon diode can be fabricated using a $ \mathcal{pt}$-symmetric mechanical system , in which a lossy mechanical - resonator with very weak mechanical nonlinearity is coupled to a mechanical resonator with mechanical gain but no mechanical nonlinearity . when this coupled system transits from the $ \mathcal{pt}$-symmetric regime to the broken-$\mathcal{pt}$-symmetric regime , the mechanical nonlinearity is transferred from the lossy resonator to the one with gain , and the effective nonlinearity of the system is significantly enhanced . this enhanced mechanical nonlinearity is almost lossless because of the gain - loss balance induced by the $ \mathcal{pt}$-symmetric structure . such an enhanced lossless mechanical nonlinearity is then used to control the direction of phonon propagation , and can greatly decrease ( by over three orders of magnitude ) the threshold of the input - field intensity necessary to observe the unidirectional phonon transport . we propose an experimentally realizable lossless low - threshold phonon diode of this type . our study opens up new perspectives for constructing on - chip few - phonon devices and hybrid phonon - photon components .
