we propose an active mechanism for coupling the quantized mode of a nanomechanical resonator to the persistent current in the loop of a superconducting josephson junction ( or phase slip ) flux qubit . this coupling is independently controlled by an external coupling magnetic field . the whole system forms a novel solid - state cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) architecture in the strong coupling limit . this architecture can be used to demonstrate quantum optics phenomena and coherently manipulate the qubit for quantum information processing . the coupling mechanism is applicable for more generalized situations where the superconducting josephson junction system is a multi - level system.we also address the practical issues concerning experimental realization .
