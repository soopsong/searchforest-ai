superconducting thin - film metamaterial resonators can provide a dense microwave mode spectrum with potential applications in quantum information science . we report on the fabrication and low - temperature measurement of metamaterial transmission - line resonators patterned from al thin films . we also describe multiple approaches for numerical simulations of the microwave properties of these structures , along with comparisons with the measured transmission spectra . the ability to predict the mode spectrum based on the chip layout provides a path towards future designs integrating metamaterial resonators with superconducting qubits .
