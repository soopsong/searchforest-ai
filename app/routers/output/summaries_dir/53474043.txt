many fundamental and applied experiments in quantum optics require transferring nonclassical states of light through large distances . in this context the free - space channels are a very promising alternative to optical fibers as they are mobile and enable to establish communications with moving objects , using satellites for global quantum links . for such channels the atmospheric turbulence is the main disturbing factor . the statistical properties of the fluctuating transmittance through the turbulent atmosphere are given by the probability distribution of transmittance ( pdt ) . we derive the consistent pdts for the atmospheric quantum channels by step - by - step inclusion of various atmospheric effects such as beam wandering , beam broadening and deformation of the beam into elliptic form , beam deformations into arbitrary forms . we discuss the applicability of pdt models for different propagation distances and optical turbulence strengths in the case when the receiver module has an annular aperture . we analyze the optimal detection and correction strategies which can improve the channel transmission characteristics . the obtained results are important for the design of optical experiments including postselection and adaptive strategies and for the security analysis of quantum communication protocols in free - space .
