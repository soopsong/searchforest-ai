in quantum physics , recent investigations deal with the so - called"quantum trajectory"theory . heuristic rules are usually used to give rise to"stochastic schrodinger equations"which are stochastic differential equations of non - usual type describing the physical models . these equations pose tedious problems in terms of mathematical justification : notion of solution , existence , uniqueness , justification ... in this article , we concentrate on a particular case : the poisson case . random measure theory is used in order to give rigorous sense to such equations . we prove existence and uniqueness of a solution for the associated stochastic equation . furthermore , the stochastic model is physically justified by proving that the solution can be obtained as a limit of a concrete discrete time physical model .
