high - precision manipulation of multi - qubit quantum systems requires strictly clocked and synchronized multi - channel control signals . however , practical arbitrary waveform generators ( awgs ) always suffer from random signal jitters and channel latencies that induces non - ignorable state or gate operation errors . in this paper , we analyze the average gate error caused by clock noises , from which an estimation formula is derived for quantifying the control robustness against clock noises . this measure is then employed for finding robust controls via a homotopic optimization algorithm . we also introduce our recently proposed stochastic optimization algorithm , b - grape , for training robust controls via randomly generated clock noise samples . numerical simulations on a two - qubit example demonstrate that both algorithms can greatly improve the control robustness against clock noises . the homotopic algorithm converges much faster than the b - grape algorithm , but the latter can achieve more robust controls against clock noises .
