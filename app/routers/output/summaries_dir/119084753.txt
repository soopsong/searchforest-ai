silicon photomultipliers are potentially ideal detectors for quantum optics and quantum information studies based on mesoscopic states of light . however , their non - idealities hampered their use so far . an optimal mode of operation has been developed and it is presented here , proving that this class of sensors can actually be exploited for the characterization of both classical and quantum properties of light .
