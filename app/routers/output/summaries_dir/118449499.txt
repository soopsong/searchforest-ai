accurate quantum gates are basic elements for building quantum computers . there has been great interest in designing quantum logic gates by using blockade effect of rydberg atoms recently . the fidelity and operation speed of these gates , however , are fundamentally limited by an intrinsic blockade error . here we propose a type of quantum gates , which are based on rydberg blockade effect , yet free from any blockade error . in contrast to the"blocking"method in previous schemes , we use rydberg energy shift to realize a rational generalized rabi frequency so that a $ \pi$ phase for one input state of the gate emerges . this leads to an accurate rydberg quantum logic gate that can operate on a 0.1-$\mu s$ timescale or faster because it works by a rabi frequency which is comparable to the blockade shift .
