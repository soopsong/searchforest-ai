we propose a method for measuring entangled vibronic quantum states of a trapped atom . it is based on the nonlinear dynamics of the system that appears by resonantly driving a weak electronic transition . the proposed technique allows the direct sampling of a wigner - function matrix , displaying all knowable information on the quantum correlations of the motional and electronic degrees of freedom of the atom . it opens novel possibilities for testing fundamental predictions of the quantum theory concerning interaction phenomena .
