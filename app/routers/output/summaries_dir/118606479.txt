this paper presents a relativistic symmetrical interpretation of the dirac equation in 1 + 1 dimensions which predicts no zitterbewegung for a free spin-1/2 particle . this could resolve the longstanding puzzle of zitterbewegung in relativistic quantum mechanics , and help clarify the physical meaning of the zitterbewegung currently under investigation in many - particle systems . together with an earlier paper describing a relativistic symmetrical interpretation of the klein - gordon equation \cite{heaney1 } , this new interpretation resolves some inconsistencies in the conventional interpretations of both equations . this new interpretation also makes several experimental predictions that differ from the conventional interpretation of the dirac equation .
