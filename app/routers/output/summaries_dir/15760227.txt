we give a representation for entanglement - breaking channels in separable hilbert space that generalizes the"kraus decomposition with rank one operators"and use it to describe the complementary channels . we also give necessary and sufficient condition of entanglement - breaking for a general quantum gaussian channel . application of this condition to one - mode channels provides several new cases where the additivity conjecture holds in full generality .
