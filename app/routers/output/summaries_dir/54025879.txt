a well - known situation in which a non - markovian dynamics of an open quantum system $ s$ arises is when this is coherently coupled to an auxiliary system $ m$ in contact with a markovian bath . in such cases , while the joint dynamics of $ s$-$m$ is markovian and obeys a standard ( bipartite ) lindblad - type master equation ( me ) , this is in general not true for the reduced dynamics of $ s$. furthermore , there are several instances ( \eg the dissipative jaynes - cummings model ) in which a { \it closed } me for the $ s$ 's state { \it can not } even be worked out . here , we find a class of bipartite lindblad - type mes such that the reduced me of $ s$ can be derived exactly and in a closed form for any initial product state of $ s$-$m$. we provide a detailed microscopic derivation of our result in terms of a mapping between two collision models
