frequency conversion ( fc ) and type - ii parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) processes serve as basic building blocks for the implementation of quantum optical experiments : type - ii pdc enables the efficient creation of quantum states such as photon - number states and einstein - podolsky - rosen - states ( epr - states ) . fc gives rise to technologies enabling efficient atom - photon coupling , ultrafast pulse gates and enhanced detection schemes . however , despite their widespread deployment , their theoretical treatment remains challenging . especially the multi - photon components in the high - gain regime as well as the explicit time - dependence of the involved hamiltonians hamper an efficient theoretical description of these nonlinear optical processes . in this paper , we investigate these effects and put forward two models that enable a full description of fc and type - ii pdc in the high - gain regime . we present a rigorous numerical model relying on the solution of coupled integro - differential equations that covers the complete dynamics of the process . as an alternative , we develop a simplified model that , at the expense of neglecting time - ordering effects , enables an analytical solution . while the simplified model approximates the correct solution with high fidelity in a broad parameter range , sufficient for many experimental situations , such as fc with low efficiency , entangled photon - pair generation and the heralding of single photons from type - ii pdc , our investigations reveal that the rigorous model predicts a decreased performance for fc processes in quantum pulse gate applications and an enhanced epr - state generation rate during type - ii pdc , when epr squeezing values above 12 db are considered .
