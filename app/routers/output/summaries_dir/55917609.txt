several recent experiments have demonstrated the viability of a passive device that can generate spin - entangled currents in two separate leads . however , manipulation and measurement of individual flying qubits in a solid state system has yet to be achieved . this is particularly difficult when a macroscopic number of these indistinguishable qubits are present . in order to access such an entangled current resource , we therefore show how to use it to generate distributed , static entanglement . the spatial separation between the entangled static pair can be much higher than that achieved by only exploiting the tunnelling effects between quantum dots . our device is completely passive , and requires only weak coulomb interactions between static and flying spins . we show that the entanglement generated is robust to decoherence for large enough currents .
