transcription factors regulate gene expression , but how these proteins recognize and specifically bind to their dna targets is still debated . machine learning models are effective means to reveal interaction mechanisms . here we studied the ability of a quantum machine learning approach to predict binding specificity . using simplified datasets of a small number of dna sequences derived from actual binding affinity experiments , we trained a commercially available quantum annealer to classify and rank transcription factor binding . the results were compared to state - of - the - art classical approaches for the same simplified datasets , including simulated annealing , simulated quantum annealing , multiple linear regression , lasso , and extreme gradient boosting . despite technological limitations , we find a slight advantage in classification performance and nearly equal ranking performance using the quantum annealer for these fairly small training data sets . thus , we propose that quantum annealing might be an effective method to implement machine learning for certain computational biology problems .
