we present an algorithm for projecting superoperators onto the set of completely positive , trace - preserving maps . when combined with gradient descent of a cost function , the procedure results in an algorithm for quantum process tomography : finding the quantum process that best fits a set of sufficient observations . we compare the performance of our algorithm to the diluted iterative algorithm as well as second - order solvers interfaced with the popular cvx package for matlab , and find it to be significantly faster and more accurate while guaranteeing a physical estimate .
