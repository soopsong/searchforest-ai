we introduce a markov chain model of concurrent quantum programs . this model is a quantum generalization of hart , sharir and pnueli 's probabilistic concurrent programs . some characterizations of the reachable space , uniformly repeatedly reachable space and termination of a concurrent quantum program are derived by the analysis of their mathematical structures . based on these characterizations , algorithms for computing the reachable space and uniformly repeatedly reachable space and for deciding the termination are given .
