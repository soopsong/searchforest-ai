we present the results of a linear optics photonic implementation of a quantum circuit that simulates a phase covariant cloner , by using two different degrees of freedom of a single photon . we experimentally simulate the action of two mirrored $ 1\rightarrow 2 $ cloners , each of them biasing the cloned states into opposite regions of the bloch sphere . we show that by applying a random sequence of these two cloners , an eavesdropper can mitigate the amount of noise added to the original input state and therefore prepare clones with no bias but with the same individual fidelity , masking its presence in a quantum key distribution protocol . input polarization qubit states are cloned into path qubit states of the same photon , which is identified as a potential eavesdropper in a quantum key distribution protocol . the device has the flexibility to produce mirrored versions that optimally clone states on either the northern or southern hemispheres of the bloch sphere , as well as to simulate optimal and non - optimal cloning machines by tuning the asymmetry on each of the cloning machines .
