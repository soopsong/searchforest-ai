using a dynamical quantum zeno effect , we propose a general approach to control the coupling between a two - level system ( tls ) and its surroundings , by modulating the energy level spacing of the tls with a high frequency signal . we show that the tls -- surroundings interaction can be turned on or off when the ratio between the amplitude and the frequency of the modulating field is adjusted to be a zero of a bessel function . the quantum zeno effect of the tls can also be observed by the vanishing of the photon reflection at these zeros . based on these results , we propose a quantum switch to control the transport of a single photon in a 1d waveguide . our analytical results agree well with numerical results using floquet theory .
