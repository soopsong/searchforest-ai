light propagating in a nondispersive medium is accompanied by a mass density wave ( mdw ) of atoms set in motion by the optical force of the field itself [ phys . rev . a 95 , 063850 ( 2017 ) ] . this recent result is in strong contrast with the approximation of fixed atoms , which assumes that atoms are fixed to their equilibrium positions when light propagates in a medium and which is deeply rooted in the conventional electrodynamics of continuous media . in many photonic materials , the atoms carry the majority of the total momentum of light and their motion also gives rise to net transfer of medium mass with a light pulse . in this work , we use optoelastic continuum dynamics combining the optical force field , elasticity theory , and newtonian mechanics to analyze the angular momentum carried by the mdw . we show that accounting for the mdw in the analysis of the angular momentum gives for the field 's share of the total angular momentum of light a quantized value that is generally a fraction of $ \hbar$. in contrast , the total angular momentum of the mass - polariton ( mp ) quasiparticle , which is a coupled state of the field and the mdw , and also the elementary quantum of light in a medium , is an integer multiple of $ \hbar$. the same coupling is found for orbital and spin angular momentum components . the physical picture of the angular momentum of light emerging from our theory is fundamentally more general than earlier theoretical models , in which the total angular momentum of light is assumed to be carried by the electromagnetic field only or by an electronic polariton state , which also involves dipolar electronic oscillations . these models can not describe the mdw shift of atoms associated with light . we simulate the mdw of laguerre - gaussian pulses in silicon and present a schematic experimental setup for measuring the contribution of the atomic mdw to the total angular momentum of light .
