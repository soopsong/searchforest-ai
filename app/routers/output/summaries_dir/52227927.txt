we describe a hybrid quantum system composed of a micrometer - size carbon nanotube ( cnt ) longitudinally coupled to a flux qubit . we demonstrate the usefulness of this device for generating high - fidelity nonclassical states of the cnt via dissipative quantum engineering . sideband cooling of the cnt to its ground state and generating a squeezed ground state , as a mechanical analogue of the optical squeezed vacuum , are two additional examples of the dissipative quantum engineering studied here . moreover , we show how to generate a long - lived macroscopically - distinct superposition ( i.e. , a schr\"odinger cat - like ) state . this cat state can be trapped , under some conditions , in a dark state , as can be verified by detecting the optical response of control fields .
