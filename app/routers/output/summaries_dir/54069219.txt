we study the holographic entanglement entropy for singular surfaces in theories described holographically by hyperscaling violating backgrounds . we consider singular surfaces consisting of cones or creases in diverse dimensions . the structure of uv divergences of entanglement entropy exhibits new logarithmic terms whose coefficients , being cut - off independent , could be used to define new central charges in the nearly smooth limit . we also show that there is a relation between these central charges and the one appearing in the two - point function of the energy - momentum tensor . finally we examine how this relation is affected by considering higher - curvature terms in the gravitational action .
