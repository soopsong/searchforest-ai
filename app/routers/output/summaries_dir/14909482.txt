contextuality is a foundational phenomenon underlying key differences between quantum theory and classical realistic descriptions of the world . here we propose an experimental test which is capable of revealing contextuality in all qutrit systems , except the completely mixed state , provided we choose the measurement basis appropriately . the 3-level system is furnished by the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom of a single photon , which encompass three orthogonal modes . projective measurements along rays in the 3-dimensional hilbert space are made by linear optical elements and detectors which are sensitive to a single mode . we also discuss the impact of detector inefficiency and losses and review the theoretical foundations of this test .
