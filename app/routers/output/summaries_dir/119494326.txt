quantum temporal correlations exhibited by violations of leggett - garg inequality ( lgi ) and temporal steering inequality ( tsi ) are in general found to be non - increasing under decoherence channels when probed on two - qubit pure entangled states . we study the action of decoherence channels , such as amplitude damping , phase - damping and depolarising channels when partial memory is introduced in a way such that two consecutive uses of the channels are time - correlated . we show that temporal correlations demonstrated by violations of the above temporal inequalities can be protected against decoherence using the effect of memory .
