we develop a notion of dephasing under the action of a quantum markov semigroup in terms of convergence of operators to a block - diagonal form determined by irreducible invariant subspaces . if the latter are all one - dimensional , we say the dephasing is maximal . with this definition , we show that a key necessary requirement on the lindblad generator is bistochasticity , and focus on characterizing whether a maximally dephasing evolution may be described in terms of a unitary dilation with only classical noise , as opposed to a genuine non - commutative hudson - parthasarathy dilation . to this end , we make use of a seminal result of k\"{u}mmerer and maassen on the class of commutative dilations of quantum markov semigroups . in particular , we introduce an intrinsic quantity constructed from the generator , which vanishes if and only if the latter admits a self - adjoint representation and which quantifies the degree of obstruction to having a classical diffusive noise model .
