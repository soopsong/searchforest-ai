the information loss paradox is often presented as an unavoidable consequence of well - established physics . however , in order for a genuine paradox to ensue , not - trivial assumptions about , e.g. , quantum effects on spacetime , are necessary . in this work we will be explicit about these additional , speculative assumptions required . we will also sketch a map of the available routes to tackle the issue , highlighting the , often overlooked , commitments demanded of each alternative . in particular , we will display the strong link between black holes , the issue of information loss and the measurement problem .
