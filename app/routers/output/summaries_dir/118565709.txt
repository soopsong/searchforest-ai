violations of bell inequalities are better preserved by turbulent atmospheric channels than by comparable optical fibers in the scenario of copropagating entangled photons [ a.a . semenov and w. vogel , phys . rev . a 81 , 023835 ( 2010 ) ; arxiv:0909.2492 ] . here we reexamine this result for the case of counterpropagation also considering the fact that each receiver registers so - called double - click events , which are caused by dark counts , stray light , and multi - photon entangled pairs . we show that advantages of the atmospheric links are feasible only for the copropagation scenario in the case of strong fluctuations of losses . for counterpropagation , the violations of bell inequalities can be improved with an additional postselection procedure testing the channel transmittance .
