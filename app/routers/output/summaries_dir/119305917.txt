we investigate continuous variable quantum teleportation using non - gaussian states of the radiation field as entangled resources . we compare the performance of different classes of degaussified resources , including two - mode photon - added and two - mode photon - subtracted squeezed states . we then introduce a class of two - mode squeezed bell - like states with one - parameter dependence for optimization . these states interpolate between and include as subcases different classes of degaussified resources . we show that optimized squeezed bell - like resources yield a remarkable improvement in the fidelity of teleportation both for coherent and nonclassical input states . the investigation reveals that the optimal non - gaussian resources for continuous variable teleportation are those that most closely realize the simultaneous maximization of the content of entanglement , the degree of affinity with the two - mode squeezed vacuum and the , suitably measured , amount of non - gaussianity .
