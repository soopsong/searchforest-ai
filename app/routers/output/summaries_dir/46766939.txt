a tunable , all - optical , coupling method has been realized for a high-\textit{q } silica microsphere and an optical waveguide . by means of a novel optical nanopositioning method , induced thermal expansion of an asymmetric microsphere stem for laser powers up to 171~mw has been observed and used to fine tune the microsphere - waveguide coupling . microcavity displacements ranging from ( 0.612~$\pm$~0.13 ) -- ( 1.5 $ \pm$ 0.13 ) $ \mu$m and nanometer scale sensitivities varying from ( 2.81 $ \pm$ 0.08 ) -- ( 7.39 $ \pm$ 0.17 ) nm / mw , with an apparent linear dependency of coupling distance on stem laser heating , were obtained . using this method , the coupling was altered such that different coupling regimes could be explored for particular samples . this tunable coupling method , in principle , could be incorporated into lab - on - a - chip microresonator systems , photonic molecule systems , and other nanopositioning frameworks .
