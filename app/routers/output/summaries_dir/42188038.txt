a quantum otto heat engine is studied with multilevel identical particles trapped in one - dimensional box potential as working substance . the symmetrical wave function for bosons and the anti - symmetrical wave function for fermions are considered . in two - particle case , we focus on the ratios of $ w^i$ ( $ i = b , f$ ) to $ w_s$ , where $ w^b$ and $ w^f$ are the work done by two bosons and fermions respectively , and $ w_s$ is the work output of a single particle under the same conditions . due to the symmetric of the wave functions , the ratios are not equal to $ 2$. three different regimes , low temperature regime , high temperature regime , and intermediate temperature regime , are analyzed , and the effects of energy level number and the differences between the two baths are calculated . in the multiparticle case , we calculate the ratios of $ w^i_m / m$ to $ w_s$ , where $ w^i_m / m$ can be seen as the average work done by a single particle in multiparticle heat engine . for other working substances whose energy spectrum have the form of $ e_n\sim n^2 $ , the results are similar . for the case $ e_n\sim n$ , two different conclusions are obtained .
