we construct a descriptive toy model that considers quantum effects on biological evolution starting from chaitin 's classical framework . there are smart evolution scenarios in which a quantum world is as favorable as classical worlds for evolution to take place . however , in more natural scenarios , the rate of evolution depends on the degree of entanglement present in quantum organisms with respect to classical organisms . if the entanglement is maximal , classical evolution turns out to be more favorable .
