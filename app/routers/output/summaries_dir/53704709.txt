we propose a quantum optical device to experimentally realize quantum processes , which perform the regularization of the --- in general highly singular --- glauber - sudarshan $ p$~functions of arbitrary quantum states before their application and/or measurement . this allows us to produce a broad class of nonclassical states with regular $ p$~functions , also called nonclassicality quasiprobabilities . for this purpose , the input states are combined on highly transmissive beam splitters with specific gaussian or non - gaussian classical states . we study both balanced and unbalanced homodyne detections for the direct sampling of the output states of the implemented processes , which requires no further regularization or state - reconstruction . by numerical simulations we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and we outline the generalization to multimode light .
