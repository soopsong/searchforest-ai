we introduce a general framework for detecting genuine multipartite entanglement and non full - separability in multipartite quantum systems of arbitrary dimensions based on correlation tensors . regarding genuine multipartite entanglement our conditions are comparable to previous approaches in the case of qubits while they show particular strength in the relatively unexplored case of higher dimensional systems . in the case of non - full separability our conditions prove to be advantageous in situations where more than two - body correlations are relevant , where most previous conditions turned out to be weak . moreover , they allow for the detection of fully bound entangled states . finally , we also discuss experimentally - friendly ways of implementing our conditions , which are based on directly measurable quantities .
