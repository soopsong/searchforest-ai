the su(1,1 ) interferometer can be thought of as a mach - zehnder interferometer with its linear beamsplitters replaced with parametric nonlinear optical processes . we consider the cases of bright and vacuum - seeded su(1,1 ) interferometers using intensity or homodyne detectors . a simplified , truncated scheme with only one nonlinear interaction is introduced , which not only beats conventional intensity detection with a bright seed , but can saturate the phase sensitivity bound set by the quantum fisher information . we also show that the truncated scheme achieves a sub - shot - noise phase sensitivity in the vacuum - seeded case , despite the phase - sensing optical beams having no well - defined phase .
