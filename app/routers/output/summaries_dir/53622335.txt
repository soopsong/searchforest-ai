we propose a $ \theta$-scheme to discretize the $ d$-dimensional stochastic cubic schr\"odinger equation in stratono\-vich sense . a uniform bound for the hamiltonian of the discrete problem is obtained , which is a crucial property to verify the convergence in probability towards a mild solution . furthermore , based on the uniform bounds of iterates in $ { \mathbb h}^2(\mathcal{o})$ for $ \mathcal{o}\subset\mathbb{r}^{1}$ , the optimal convergence order 1 in strong local sense is obtained .
