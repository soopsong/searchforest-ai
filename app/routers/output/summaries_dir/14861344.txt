we realize a deterministic single - photon source from one and the same calcium ion interacting with a high - finesse optical cavity . photons are created in the cavity with efficiency ( 88 + - 17)% , a tenfold improvement over previous cavity - ion sources . results of the second - order correlation function are presented , demonstrating a high suppression of two - photon events limited only by background counts . the cavity photon pulse shape is obtained , with good agreement between experiment and simulation . moreover , theoretical analysis of the temporal evolution of the atomic populations provides relevant information about the dynamics of the process and opens the way to future investigations of a coherent atom - photon interface .
