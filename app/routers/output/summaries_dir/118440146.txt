a review of hollow core whispering gallery resonators ( wgrs)is given . after a short introduction to the topic of whispering gallery resonators we provide a description of whispering gallery modes in hollow or liquid core wgrs . next , whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) sensing mechanisms are outlined and some fabrication methods for microbubbles , microcapillaries and other tubular wgm devices are discussed . we then focus on the most common applications of hollow core wgrs , namely refractive index and temperature sensing , gas sensing , force sensing , biosensing , and lasing . the review highlights some of the key papers in this field and gives the reader a general overview of the current state - of - the - art .
