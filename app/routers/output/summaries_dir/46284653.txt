several information measures have recently been defined which capture the notion of"recoverability . "in particular , the fidelity of recovery quantifies how well one can recover a system $ a$ of a tripartite quantum state , defined on systems $ abc$ , by acting on system $ c$ alone . the relative entropy of recovery is an associated measure in which the fidelity is replaced by relative entropy . in this paper , we provide concrete operational interpretations of the aforementioned recovery measures in terms of a computational decision problem and a hypothesis testing scenario . specifically , we show that the fidelity of recovery is equal to the maximum probability with which a computationally unbounded quantum prover can convince a computationally bounded quantum verifier that a given quantum state is recoverable . the quantum interactive proof system giving this operational meaning requires four messages exchanged between the prover and verifier , but by forcing the prover to perform his actions in superposition , we construct a different proof system that requires only two messages . the result is that the associated decision problem is in qip(2 ) and another argument establishes it as hard for qszk ( both classes contain problems believed to be difficult to solve for a quantum computer ) . we finally prove that the regularized relative entropy of recovery is equal to the optimal type ii error exponent when trying to distinguish many copies of a tripartite state from a recovered version of this state , such that the type i error is constrained to be no larger than a constant .
