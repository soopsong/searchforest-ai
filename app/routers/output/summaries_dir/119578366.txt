we consider a quantum generalization of the classical heat equation , and study contractivity properties of its associated semigroup . we prove a nash inequality and a logarithmic sobolev inequality . the former leads to an ultracontractivity result . this in turn implies that the largest eigenvalue and the purity of a state with positive wigner function , evolving under the action of the semigroup , decrease at least inverse polynomially in time , while its entropy increases at least logarithmically in time .
