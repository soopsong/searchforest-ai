a mechanism describing state reduction dynamics in relativistic quantum field theory is outlined . the mechanism involves nonlinear stochastic modifications to the standard description of unitary state evolution and the introduction of a relativistic field in which a quantized degree of freedom is associated to each point in spacetime . the purpose of this field is to mediate in the interaction between classical stochastic influences and conventional quantum fields . the equations of motion are lorentz covariant , frame independent , and do not result in divergent behavior . it is shown that the mathematical framework permits the specification of unambiguous local properties providing a connection between the model and evidence of real world phenomena . the collapse process is demonstrated for an idealized example .
