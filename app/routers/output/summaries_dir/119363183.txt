we propose a new entanglement measure to quantify three qubits entanglement in terms of negativity . a monogamy inequality analogous to coffman - kundu - wootters ( ckw ) inequality is established . this consequently leads to a definition of residual entanglement , which is referred to as three-$\pi$ in order to distinguish from three - tangle . the three-$\pi$ is proved to be a natural entanglement measure . by contrast to the three - tangle , it is shown that the three-$\pi$ always gives greater than zero values for $ w$ and ghz classes , implying there always exists three - way entanglement for them , and three - tangle generally underestimates three - way entanglement of a given system . this investigation will offer an alternative tool to understand genuine multipartite entanglement .
