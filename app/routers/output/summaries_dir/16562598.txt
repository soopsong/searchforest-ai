the paper is concerned with open quantum systems whose heisenberg dynamics are described by quantum stochastic differential equations driven by external boson fields . the system - field coupling operators are assumed to be quadratic polynomials of the system observables , with the latter satisfying canonical commutation relations . in combination with a cubic system hamiltonian , this leads to a class of quasilinear quantum stochastic systems which retain algebraic closedness in the evolution of mixed moments of the observables . although such a system is nonlinear and its quantum state is no longer gaussian , the dynamics of the moments of any order are amenable to exact analysis , including the computation of their steady - state values . in particular , a generalized criterion is developed for quadratic stability of the quasilinear systems . the results of the paper are applicable to the generation of non - gaussian quantum states with manageable moments and an optimal design of linear quantum controllers for quasilinear quantum plants .
