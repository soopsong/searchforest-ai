we show how sub - planck phase - space structures in the wigner function can be used to achieve heisenberg - limited sensitivity in weak force measurements . nonclassical states of harmonic oscillators , consisting of superpositions of coherent states , are shown to be useful for the measurement of weak forces that cause translations or rotations in phase space , which is done by entangling the quantum oscillator with a two - level system . implementations of this strategy in cavity qed and ion traps are described .
