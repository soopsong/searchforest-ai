the determination of the density matrix of an ensemble of identically prepared quantum systems by performing a series of measurements , known as quantum tomography , is minimal when the number of outcomes is minimal . the most accurate minimal quantum tomography of qubits , sometimes called a tetrahedron measurement , corresponds to projections over four states which can be represented on the bloch sphere as the vertices of a regular tetrahedron . we investigate whether it is possible to implement the tetrahedron measurement of double slit qubits of light , using measurements performed on a single plane . assuming gaussian slits and free propagation , we demonstrate that a judicious choice of the detection plane and the double slit geometry allows the implementation of a tetrahedron measurement . finally , we consider possible sets of values which could be used in actual experiments .
