this work explores the definiteness of the weighted graph laplacian matrix with negative edge weights . the definiteness of the weighted laplacian is studied in terms of certain matrices that are related via congruent and similarity transformations . for a graph with a single negative weight edge , we show that the weighted laplacian becomes indefinite if the magnitude of the negative weight is less than the inverse of the effective resistance between the two incident nodes . this result is extended to multiple negative weight edges . the utility of these results are demonstrated in a weighted consensus network where appropriately placed negative weight edges can induce a clustering behavior for the protocol .
