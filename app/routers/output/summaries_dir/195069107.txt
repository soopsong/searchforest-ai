by connecting light to magnetism , cavity - magnon - polaritons ( cmps ) can build links from quantum computation to spintronics . as a consequence , cmp - based information processing devices have thrived over the last five years , but almost exclusively been investigated with single - tone spectroscopy . however , universal computing applications will require a dynamic control of the cmp on demand and within nanoseconds . in this work , we perform fast manipulations of the different cmp modes with independent but coherent pulses to the cavity and magnon system . we change the state of the cmp from the energy exchanging beat mode to its normal modes and further demonstrate two fundamental examples of coherent manipulation : first , a dynamic control over the appearance of magnon - rabi oscillations , i.e. , energy exchange , and second , a complete energy extraction by applying an anti - phase drive to the magnon . our results show a promising approach to control different building blocks for a quantum internet and pave the way for further magnon - based quantum computing research .
