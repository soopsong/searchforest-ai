the description of an impurity atom in a bose - einstein condensate can be cast in the form of frohlich 's polaron hamiltonian , where the bogoliubov excitations play the role of the phonons . an expression for the corresponding polaronic coupling strength is derived , relating the coupling strength to the scattering lengths , the trap size and the number of bose condensed atoms . this allows to identify several approaches to reach the strong - coupling limit for the quantum gas polarons , whereas this limit was hitherto experimentally inaccessible in solids . we apply feynman 's path - integral method to calculate for all coupling strengths the polaronic shift in the free energy and the increase in the effective mass . the effect of temperature on these quantities is included in the description . we find similarities to the acoustic polaron results and indications of a transition between free polarons and self - trapped polarons . the prospects , based on the current theory , of investigating the polaron physics with ultracold gases are discussed for lithium atoms in a sodium condensate .
