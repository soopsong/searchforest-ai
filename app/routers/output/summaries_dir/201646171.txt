gaussian boson sampling is a promising model for demonstrating quantum computational supremacy , which eases the experimental challenge of the standard boson - sampling proposal . here by analyzing the computational costs of classical simulation of gaussian boson sampling , we establish a lower bound for achieving quantum computational supremacy for a class of gaussian boson - sampling problems , where squeezed states are injected into every input mode . specifically , we propose a method for simplifying the brute - force calculations for the transition probabilities in gaussian boson sampling , leading to a significant reduction of the simulation costs . particularly , our numerical results indicate that we can simulate 18 photons gaussian boson sampling at the output subspace on a normal laptop , 20 photons on a commercial workstation with 256 cores , and suggest about 30 photons for supercomputers . these numbers are significantly smaller than those in standard boson sampling , suggesting gaussian boson sampling may be more feasible for demonstrating quantum computational supremacy .
