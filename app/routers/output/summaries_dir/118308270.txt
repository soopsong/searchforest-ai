we propose an original quantum memory protocol . it belongs to the class of rephasing processes and is closely related to two - pulse photon echo . it is known that the strong population inversion produced by the rephasing pulse prevents the plain two - pulse photon echo from serving as a quantum memory scheme . indeed gain and spontaneous emission generate prohibitive noise . a second $ \pi$-pulse can be used to simultaneously reverse the atomic phase and bring the atoms back into the ground state . then a secondary echo is radiated from a non - inverted medium , avoiding contamination by gain and spontaneous emission noise . however , one must kill the primary echo , in order to preserve all the information for the secondary signal . in the present work , spatial phase mismatching is used to silence the standard two - pulse echo . an experimental demonstration is presented .
