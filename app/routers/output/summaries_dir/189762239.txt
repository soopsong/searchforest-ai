we calculate the transmission spectra of a flux qubit coupled to a dissipative resonator in the ultrastrong coupling regime . such a qubit - oscillator system constitutes the building block of superconducting circuit qed platforms . the calculated transmission of a weak probe field quantifies the response of the qubit , in frequency domain , under the sole influence of the oscillator and of its dissipative environment , an ohmic heat bath . we find the distinctive features of the qubit - resonator system , namely two - dip structures in the calculated transmission , modified by the presence of the dissipative environment . the relative magnitude , positions , and broadening of the dips are determined by the interplay among qubit - oscillator detuning , the strength of their coupling , and the interaction with the heat bath .
