an input - output model of a two - level quantum system in the heisenberg picture is of bilinear form with constant system matrices , which allows the introduction of the concepts of controllability and observability in analogy with those of quantum linear systems . by means of the notions of controllability and observability , coordinate transformations , which are rotation matrices , can be constructed explicitly that transform an input - output model to a new one . the new input - output model enables us to investigate many interesting properties of the two - level quantum system , such as steady - state solutions to the lindblad master equation , quantum decoherence - free ( df ) subspaces , quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) variables , and the realization of quantum back - action evading ( bae ) measurements . the physical system in ( wang , j. \&wiseman , h. m. ( 2001 ) , feedback - stabilization of an arbitrary pure state of a two - level atom , physical review a 64(6 ) , 063810 ) is re - studied to illustrate the results presented in this paper .
