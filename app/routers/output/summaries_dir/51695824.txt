we study theoretically entanglement and operator growth in a spin system coupled to an environment , which is modeled with classical dephasing noise . using exact numerical simulations we show that the entanglement growth and its fluctuations are described by the kardar - parisi - zhang equation . moreover , we find that the wavefront in the out - of - time ordered correlator ( otoc ) , which is a measure for the operator growth , propagates linearly with the butterfly velocity and broadens diffusively with a diffusion constant that is larger than the one of spin transport . the obtained entanglement velocity is smaller than the butterfly velocity for finite noise strength , yet both of them are strongly suppressed by the noise . we calculate perturbatively how the effective time scales depend on the noise strength , both for uncorrelated markovian and for correlated non - markovian noise .
