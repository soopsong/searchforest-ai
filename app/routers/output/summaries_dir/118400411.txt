we demonstrate multiphoton blockades ( pb ) in the pulsed regime by using kerr nonlinear dissipative resonator driven by a sequence of gaussian pulses . it is shown that the results obtained for single - photon , two - photon and three - photon blockades in the pulsed excitation regime differ considerably from analogous results obtained for the case of continuous - wave ( cw ) driving . we strongly demonstrate that for the case of cw pumping of the kerr - nonlinear resonator there are fundamental limits on populations of lower photonic number - states ( with n = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) . thus , such detailed comparison demonstrates that pb due to excitation with a suitable photon pulses is realized beyond the fundamental limits established for cw excitations . we analyze photon - number effects and investigate phase - space properties of pb on the base of photon number populations , the second - order correlation functions and the wigner functions in phase space . generation of fock states due to pb in the pulsed regime is analysed in details .
