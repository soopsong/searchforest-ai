we review the main theoretical and experimental results for the transmon , a superconducting charge qubit derived from the cooper pair box . the increased ratio of the josephson to charging energy results in an exponential suppression of the transmon 's sensitivity to 1 / f charge noise . this has been observed experimentally and yields homogeneous broadening , negligible pure dephasing , and long coherence times of up to 3 microseconds . anharmonicity of the energy spectrum is required for qubit operation , and has been proven to be sufficient in transmon devices . transmons have been implemented in a wide array of experiments , demonstrating consistent and reproducible results in very good agreement with theory .
