we propose a measure of quantum steerability , namely a convex steering monotone , based on the trace distance between a given assemblage and its corresponding closest assemblage admitting a local - hidden - state ( lhs ) model . we provide methods to estimate such a quantity , via lower and upper bounds , based on semidefinite programming . one of these upper bounds has a clear geometrical interpretation as a linear function of rescaled euclidean distances in the bloch sphere between the normalized quantum states of : ( i ) a given assemblage and ( ii ) an lhs assemblage . for a qubit - qubit quantum state , the above ideas also allow us to visualize various steerability properties of the state in the bloch sphere via the so - called lhs surface . in particular , some steerability properties can be obtained by comparing such an lhs surface with a corresponding quantum steering ellipsoid . thus , we propose a witness of steerability corresponding to the difference of the volumes enclosed by these two surfaces . this witness ( which reveals the steerability of a quantum state ) enables finding an optimal measurement basis , which can then be used to determine the proposed steering monotone ( which describes the steerability of an assemblage ) optimized over all mutually - unbiased bases .
