one presents a phase - space noncommutative extension of quantum cosmology in the context of a kantowski - sachs ( ks ) minisuperspace model . we obtain the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation for the noncommutative system through the adm formalism and a suitable seiberg - witten map . the resulting wdw equation explicitly depends on the phase - space noncommutative parameters , $ \theta$ and $ \eta$. numerical solutions of the noncommutative wdw equation are found and , interestingly , also bounds on the values of the noncommutative parameters . moreover , we conclude that the noncommutativity in the momenta sector leads to a damped wave function implying that this type of noncommutativity can be relevant for a selection of possible initial states for the universe .
