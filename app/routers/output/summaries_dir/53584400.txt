quantum entanglement between qudits - the d - dimensional version of qubits - is relevant for advanced quantum information processing and provides deeper insights in the nature of quantum correlations . encoding qudits in the frequency modes of photon pairs produced by continuous parametric down - conversion enables access to high - dimensional states . by shaping the energy spectrum of entangled photons , we demonstrate the creation , characterization and manipulation of entangled qudits with dimension up to 4 . their respective density matrices are reconstructed by quantum state tomography . for qubits and qutrits we additionally measured the dependency of a d - dimensional bell parameter for various degrees of entanglement . our experiment demonstrates the ability to investigate the physics of high - dimensional frequency entangled qu$d$it states which are of great importance for quantum information science .
