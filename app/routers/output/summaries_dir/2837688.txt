information flow in quantum spin networks is considered . two types of control -- temporal bang - bang switching control and control by varying spatial degrees of freedom -- are explored and shown to be effective in speeding up information transfer and increasing transfer fidelities . the control is model - based and therefore relies on accurate knowledge of the system parameters . an efficient protocol for simultaneous identification of the coupling strength and the exact number of spins in a chain is presented .
