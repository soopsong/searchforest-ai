we present an in principle lossless sorter for radial modes of light , using accumulated gouy phases . the experimental setups have been found by a computer algorithm , and can be intuitively understood in a geometric way . together with the ability to sort angular - momentum modes , we now have access to the complete 2-dimensional transverse plane of light . the device can readily be used in multiplexing classical information . on a quantum level , it is an analog of the stern - gerlach experiment -- significant for the discussion of fundamental concepts in quantum physics . as such , it can be applied in high - dimensional and multi - photonic quantum experiments .
