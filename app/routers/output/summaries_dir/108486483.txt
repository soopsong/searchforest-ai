quantum amplification is essential for various quantum technologies such as communication and weak - signal detection . however , its practical use is still limited due to inevitable device fragility that brings about distortion in the output signal or state . this paper presents a general theory that solves this critical issue . the key idea is simple and easy to implement : just a passive feedback of the amplifier 's auxiliary mode , which is usually thrown away . in fact , this scheme makes the controlled amplifier significantly robust , and furthermore it realizes the minimum - noise amplification even under realistic imperfections . hence , the presented theory enables the quantum amplification to be implemented at a practical level . also , a nondegenerate parametric amplifier subjected to a special detuning is proposed to show that , additionally , it has a broadband nature .
