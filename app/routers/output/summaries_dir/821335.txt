the vast majority of real - world networks are scale - free , loopy , and sparse , with a power - law degree distribution and a constant average degree . in this paper , we study first - order consensus dynamics in binary scale - free networks , where vertices are subject to white noise . we focus on the coherence of networks characterized in terms of the $ h_2$-norm , which quantifies how closely agents track the consensus value . we first provide a lower bound of coherence of a network in terms of its average degree , which is independent of the network order . we then study the coherence of some sparse , scale - free real - world networks , which approaches a constant . we also study numerically the coherence of barab\'asi - albert networks and high - dimensional random apollonian networks , which also converges to a constant when the networks grow . finally , based on the connection of coherence and the kirchhoff index , we study analytically the coherence of two deterministically - growing sparse networks and obtain the exact expressions , which tend to small constants . our results indicate that the effect of noise on the consensus dynamics in power - law networks is negligible . we argue that scale - free topology , together with loopy structure , is responsible for the strong robustness with respect to noisy consensus dynamics in power - law networks .
