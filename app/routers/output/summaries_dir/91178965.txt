we theoretically investigate a weakly - interacting degenerate bose gas coupled to an empty markovian bath . we show that in the universal phononic limit the system evolves towards an asymptotic state where an emergent temperature is set by the quantum noise of the outcoupling process . for situations typically encountered in experiments , this mechanism leads to significant cooling . such dissipative cooling supplements conventional evaporative cooling and dominates in settings where thermalization is highly suppressed , such as in a one - dimensional quasicondensate .
