the question of which two - qubit states are steerable ( i.e. permit a demonstration of epr - steering ) remains open . here , a strong necessary condition is obtained for the steerability of two - qubit states having maximally - mixed reduced states , via the construction of local hidden state models . it is conjectured that this condition is in fact sufficient . two provably sufficient conditions are also obtained , via asymmetric epr - steering inequalities . our work uses ideas from the quantum steering ellipsoid formalism , and explicitly evaluates the integral of $ \boldsymbol n/(\boldsymbol n^\intercal a\boldsymbol n)^2 $ over arbitrary unit hemispheres for any positive matrix $ a$.
