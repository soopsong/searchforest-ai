we present a workbench for the study of real - time quantum imaging by measuring the frame - by - frame quantum noise reduction of multi - spatial - mode twin beams generated by four wave mixing in rb vapor . exploiting the multiple spatial modes of this squeezed light source , we utilize spatial light modulators to selectively pass macropixels of quantum correlated modes from each of the twin beams to a high quantum efficiency balanced detector . in low - light - level imaging applications , the ability to measure the quantum correlations between individual spatial modes and macropixels of spatial modes with a single pixel camera will facilitate compressive quantum imaging with sensitivity below the photon shot noise limit .
