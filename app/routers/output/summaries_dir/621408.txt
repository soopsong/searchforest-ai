in this paper , a library - based synthesis methodology for reversible circuits is proposed where a reversible specification is considered as a permutation comprising a set of cycles . to this end , a pre - synthesis optimization step is introduced to construct a reversible specification from an irreversible function . in addition , a cycle - based representation model is presented to be used as an intermediate format in the proposed synthesis methodology . the selected intermediate format serves as a focal point for all potential representation models . in order to synthesize a given function , a library containing seven building blocks is used where each building block is a cycle of length less than 6 . to synthesize large cycles , we also propose a decomposition algorithm which produces all possible minimal and inequivalent factorizations for a given cycle of length greater than 5 . all decompositions contain the maximum number of disjoint cycles . the generated decompositions are used in conjunction with a novel cycle assignment algorithm which is proposed based on the graph matching problem to select the best possible cycle pairs . then , each pair is synthesized by using the available components of the library . the decomposition algorithm together with the cycle assignment method are considered as a binding method which selects a building block from the library for each cycle . finally , a post - synthesis optimization step is introduced to optimize the synthesis results in terms of different costs .
