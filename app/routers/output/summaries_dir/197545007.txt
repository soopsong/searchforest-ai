we present a thermodynamic framework for the refined weak coupling limit . in this limit the interaction between system and environment is weak , but not negligible . as a result , the system dynamics becomes non - markovian breaking divisibility conditions . nevertheless , we propose a derivation of the first and second law just in terms of the reduced system dynamics . to this end , we extend the refined weak coupling limit for allowing slowly - varying external drivings , and reconsider the definition of internal energy due to the non - negligible interaction .
