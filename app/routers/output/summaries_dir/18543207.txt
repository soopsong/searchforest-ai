we describe a new technique for obtaining tsirelson bounds , or upper bounds on the quantum value of a bell inequality . since quantum correlations do not allow signaling , we obtain a tsirelson bound by maximizing over all no - signaling probability distributions . this maximization can be cast as a linear program . in a setting where three parties , a , b , and c , share an entangled quantum state of arbitrary dimension , we : ( i ) bound the trade - off between ab 's and ac 's violation of the chsh inequality , and ( ii ) demonstrate that forcing b and c to be classically correlated prevents a and b from violating certain bell inequalities , relevant for interactive proof systems and cryptography .
