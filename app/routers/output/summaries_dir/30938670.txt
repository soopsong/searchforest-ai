the interaction between light and matter can give rise to novel topological states . this principle was recently exemplified in floquet topological insulators , where \emph{classical } light was used to induce a topological electronic band structure . here , in contrast , we show that mixing \emph{single } photons with excitons can result in new topological polaritonic states --- or"topolaritons " . taken separately , the underlying photons and excitons are topologically trivial . combined appropriately , however , they give rise to non - trivial polaritonic bands with chiral edge modes allowing for unidirectional polariton propagation . the main ingredient in our construction is an exciton - photon coupling with a phase that winds in momentum space . we demonstrate how this winding emerges from spin - orbit coupling in the electronic system and an applied zeeman field . we discuss the requirements for obtaining a sizable topological gap in the polariton spectrum , and propose practical ways to realize topolaritons in semiconductor quantum wells and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides .
