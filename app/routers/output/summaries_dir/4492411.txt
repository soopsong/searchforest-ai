zeeman fields can drive semiconductor quantum wires with strong spin - orbit coupling and in proximity to s - wave superconductors into a topological phase which supports end majorana fermions and offers an attractive platform for realizing topological quantum information processing . here , we investigate how potential disorder affects the topological phase by a combination of analytical and numerical approaches . most prominently , we find that the robustness of the topological phase against disorder depends sensitively and non - monotonously on the zeeman field applied to the wire .
