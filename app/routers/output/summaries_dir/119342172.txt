we define a formal framework for equivalence checking of sequential quantum circuits . the model we adopted is a quantum state machine , which is a natural quantum generalisation of mealy machines . a major difficulty in checking quantum circuits ( but not present in checking classical circuits ) is that the state spaces of quantum circuits are continuums . this difficulty is resolved by our main theorem showing that equivalence checking of two quantum mealy machines can be done with input sequences that are taken from some chosen basis ( which are finite ) and have a length quadratic in the dimensions of the state hilbert spaces of the machines . based on this theoretical result , we develop an ( and to the best of our knowledge , the first ) algorithm for checking equivalence of sequential quantum circuits . a case study and experiments are presented .
