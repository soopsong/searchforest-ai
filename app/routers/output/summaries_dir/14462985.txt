in topologically - protected quantum computation , quantum gates can be carried out by adiabatically braiding two - dimensional quasiparticles , reminiscent of entangled world lines . bonesteel et al . [ phys . rev . lett . 95 , 140503 ( 2005 ) ] , as well as leijnse and flensberg [ phys . rev . b 86 , 104511 ( 2012 ) ] recently provided schemes for computing quantum gates from quasiparticle braids . mathematically , the problem of executing a gate becomes that of finding a product of the generators ( matrices ) in that set that approximates the gate best , up to an error . to date , efficient methods to compute these gates only strive to optimize for accuracy . we explore the possibility of using a generic approach applicable to a variety of braiding problems based on evolutionary ( genetic ) algorithms . the method efficiently finds optimal braids while allowing the user to optimize for the relative utilities of accuracy and/or length . furthermore , when optimizing for error only , the method can quickly produce efficient braids .
