this paper proposes a new protocol for quantum dense key distribution . this protocol embeds the benefits of a quantum dense coding and a quantum key distribution and is able to generate shared secret keys four times more efficiently than bb84 one . we hereinafter prove the security of this scheme against individual eavesdropping attacks , and we present preliminary experimental results , showing its feasibility .
