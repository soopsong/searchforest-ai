significant successes have recently been reported in the study of the generation of spectrally pure state in group - velocity - matched ( gvm ) nonlinear crystals . however , the gvm condition can only be realized in limited kinds of crystals and at limited wavelengths . here , we investigate pure state generation in the isomorphs of ppktp crystal : i.e. , periodically poled rtp , kta , rta and cta crystals . by numerical simulation , we find that these crystals from the ktp family can generate pure photons with high spectral purity ( over 0.8 ) , wide tunability ( more than 400 nm ) , reasonable nonlinearity at a variety of wavelengths ( from 1300 nm to 2100 nm ) . it is also discovered that the ppcta crystal may achieve purity of 0.97 at 1506 nm . this study may provide more and better choices for quantum state engineering at telecom wavelengths .
