we extend the black hole / qudit correspondence by identifying five and six - dimensional 1/2-bps black string and hole charge vectors in n=8 and n=2 magic supergravities with qubits and qutrits over composition algebras . in d=6 , this is accomplished via hopf fibrations , which map qubits over composition algebras to rank one elements of jordan algebras of degree two . an analogous procedure maps qutrits over composition algebras to d=5 charge vectors , which are rank one elements of jordan algebras of degree three . in both cases , the u - duality groups are interpreted as qudit slocc transformation groups . we provide explicit gates for such transformations and study their applications in toroidally compactified m - theory .
