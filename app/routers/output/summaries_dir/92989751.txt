a fundamental task in any physical theory is to quantify certain physical quantity in a meaningful way . in this paper we show that both fidelity distance and affinity distance satisfy the strong contractibility , and the corresponding resource quantifiers can be used to characterize a large class of resource theories . under two assumptions , namely , convexity of"free states"and closure of free states under"selective free operations " , our general framework of resource theory includes quantum resource theories of entanglement , coherence , partial coherence and superposition . in partial coherence theory , we show that fidelity partial coherence of a bipartite state is equal to the minimal error probability of a mixed quantum state discrimination ( qsd ) task and vice versa , which complements the main result in [ xiong and wu , j. phys . a : math . theor . 51 , 414005 ( 2018 ) ] . we also compute the analytic expression of fidelity partial coherence for $ ( 2,n)$ bipartite x - states . at last , we study the correlated coherence in the framework of partial coherence theory . we show that partial coherence of a bipartite state , with respect to the eigenbasis of a subsystem , is actually a measure of quantum correlation .
