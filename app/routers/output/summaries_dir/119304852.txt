we study the problem of charging a quantum battery in finite time . we demonstrate an analytical optimal protocol for the case of a single qubit . extending this analysis to an array of n qubits , we demonstrate that an n - fold advantage in power per qubit can be achieved when global operations are permitted . the exemplary analytic argument for this quantum advantage in the charging power is backed up by numerical analysis using optimal control techniques . it is demonstrated that the quantum advantage for power holds when , with cyclic operation in mind , initial and final states are required to be separable .
