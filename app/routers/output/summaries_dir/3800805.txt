we report investigation on quantum discord in classical second - order interference . in particular , we theoretically show that a bipartite state with d = 0.311 of discord can be generated via classical second - order interference . we also experimentally verify the theory by obtaining d = 0.197 + - 0.060 of non - zero discord state . together with the fact that non - classicalities originated from physical constraints and information theoretic perspectives are not equivalent , this result provides an insight to understand the nature of quantum discord .
