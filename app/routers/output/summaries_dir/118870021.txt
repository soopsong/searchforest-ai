the collective dynamics of a dipolar fermionic quantum gas confined in a one - dimensional double - well superlattice is explored . the fermionic gas resides in a paramagnetic - like ground state in the weak interaction regime , upon which a new type of collective dynamics is found when applying a local perturbation . this dynamics is composed of the local tunneling of fermions in separate supercells , and is a pure quantum effect , with no classical counterpart . due to the presence of the dipolar interactions the local tunneling transports through the entire superlattice , giving rise to a collective dynamics . a well - defined momentum - energy dispersion relation is identified in the ab - initio simulations demonstrating the phonon - like behavior . the phonon - like characteristic is also confirmed by an analytical description of the dynamics within a semiclassical picture .
