we address the problem of implementing high fidelity one - qubit operations subject to time dependent noise in the qubit energy splitting . we show with explicit numerical results that high fidelity bit flips and one - qubit not gates may be generated by imposing bounded control fields . for noise correlation times shorter than the time for a pi - pulse , the time optimal pi - pulse yields the highest fidelity . for very long correlation times , fidelity loss is approximately due to systematic error , which is efficiently tackled by compensation for off - resonance with a pulse sequence ( corpse ) . for intermediate ranges of the noise correlation time we find that short corpse , which is less accurate than corpse in correcting systematic errors , yields higher fidelities . numerical optimization of the pulse sequences using gradient ascent pulse engineering results in noticeable improvement of the fidelities for the bit flip and marginal improvement for the not gate .
