recent work has shown that deploying two nondegenerate optical parametric amplifiers ( nopas ) separately at two distant parties in a coherent feedback loop generates stronger einstein - podolski - rosen ( epr ) entanglement between two propagating continuous - mode output fields than a single nopa under same pump power , decay rate and transmission losses . the purpose of this paper is to investigate the stability and epr entanglement of a dual - nopa coherent feedback system under the effect of phase shifts in the transmission channel between two distant parties . it is shown that , in the presence of phase shifts , epr entanglement worsens or can vanish , but can be improved to some extent in certain scenarios by adding a phase shifter at each output with a certain value of phase shift . in ideal cases , in the absence of transmission and amplification losses , existence of epr entanglement and whether the original epr entanglement can be recovered by the additional phase shifters are decided by values of the phase shifts in the path .
