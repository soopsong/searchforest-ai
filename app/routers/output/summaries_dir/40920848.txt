we propose and analyse a feasible experimental scheme for a quantum force sensor based on the elimination of back - action noise through coherent quantum noise cancellation ( cqnc ) in a hybrid atom - cavity optomechanical setup assisted with squeezed vacuum injection . the force detector , which allows for a continuous , broad - band detection of weak forces well below the standard quantum limit ( sql ) , is formed by a single optical cavity simultaneously coupled to a mechanical oscillator and to an ensemble of ultracold atoms . the latter acts as a negative - mass oscillator so that atomic noise cancels exactly the back - action noise from the mechanical oscillator due to destructive quantum interference . squeezed vacuum injection enforces this cancellation and allows to reach sub - sql sensitivity in a very wide frequency band , and at much lower input laser powers .
