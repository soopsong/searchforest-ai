we analyze homodyne detection of macroscopically bright multimode nonclassical states of light and propose their application in quantum communication . we observe that the homodyne detection is sensitive to a mode - matching of the bright light to the highly intense local oscillator . unmatched bright modes of light result in additional noise which technically limits detection of gaussian entanglement at macroscopic level . when the mode - matching is sufficient , we show that multimode quantum key distribution with bright beams is feasible . it finally merges the quantum communication with classical optical technology of visible beams of light .
