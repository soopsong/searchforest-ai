the quantum internet is envisioned as the final stage of the quantum revolution , opening fundamentally new communications and computing capabilities , including the distributed quantum computing . but the quantum internet is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics . phenomena with no counterpart in classical networks , such as no - cloning , quantum measurement , entanglement and teleporting , impose very challenging constraints for the network design . specifically , classical network functionalities , ranging from error - control mechanisms to overhead - control strategies , are based on the assumption that classical information can be safely read and copied . but this assumption does not hold in the quantum internet . as a consequence , the design of the quantum internet requires a major network - paradigm shift to harness the quantum mechanics specificities . the goal of this work is to shed light on the challenges and the open problems of the quantum internet design . to this aim , we first introduce some basic knowledge of quantum mechanics , needed to understand the differences between a classical and a quantum network . then , we introduce quantum teleportation as the key strategy for transmitting quantum information without physically transferring the particle that stores the quantum information or violating the principles of the quantum mechanics . finally , the key research challenges to design quantum communication networks are described .
