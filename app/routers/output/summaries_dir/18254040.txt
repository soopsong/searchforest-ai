we describe a measurement device principle based on discrete iterations of bayesian updating of system state probability distributions . although purely classical by nature , these measurements are accompanied with a progressive collapse of the system state probability distribution during each complete system measurement . this measurement scheme finds applications in analysing repeated non - demolition indirect quantum measurements . we also analyse the continuous time limit of these processes , either in the brownian diffusive limit or in the poissonian jumpy limit . in the quantum mechanical framework , this continuous time limit leads to belavkin equations which describe quantum systems under continuous measurements .
