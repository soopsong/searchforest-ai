properties of weak spatio - spectral twin beams in paraxial approximation are analyzed using the decomposition into appropriate paired modes . numbers of paired modes as well as numbers of modes in the signal ( or idler ) field in the transverse wave - vector and spectral domains are analyzed as functions of pump - beam parameters . spatial and spectral coherence of weak twin beams is described by auto- and cross - correlation functions . relation between the numbers of modes and coherence is discussed .
