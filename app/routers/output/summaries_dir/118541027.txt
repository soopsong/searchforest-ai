an overview of current status and prospects of the development of quantum computer hardware based on inorganic crystals doped with rare - earth ions is presented . major parts of the experimental work in this area has been done in two places , canberra , australia and lund , sweden , and the present description follows more closely the lund work . techniques will be described that include optimal filtering of the initially inhomogeneously broadened profile down to well separated and narrow ensembles , as well as the use of advanced pulse - shaping in order to achieve robust arbitrary single - qubit operations with fidelities above 90 % , as characterized by quantum state tomography . it is expected that full scalability of these systems will require the ability to determine the state of single rare - earth ions . it has been proposed that this can be done using special readout ions doped into the crystal and an update is given on the work to find and characterize such ions . finally , a few aspects on the possibilities for remote entanglement of ions in separate rare - earth - ion - doped crystals are considered .
