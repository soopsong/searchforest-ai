we study how the spontaneous relaxation of a qubit affects a continuous quantum non - demolition measurement of the initial state of the qubit . given some noisy measurement record $ \psi$ , we seek an estimate of whether the qubit was initially in the ground or excited state . we investigate four different measurement protocols , three of which use a linear filter ( with different weighting factors ) and a fourth which uses a full non - linear filter that gives the theoretically optimal estimate of the initial state of the qubit . we find that relaxation of the qubit at rate $ 1 / t_1 $ strongly influences the fidelity of any measurement protocol . to avoid errors due to this decay , the measurement must be completed in a time that decrease linearly with the desired fidelity while maintaining an adequate signal to noise ratio . we find that for the non - linear filter the predicted fidelity , as expected , is always better than the linear filters and that the fidelity is a monotone increasing function of the measurement time . for example , to achieve a fidelity of 90 % , the box car linear filter requires a signal to noise ratio of $ \sim 30 $ in a time $ t_1 $ whereas the non - linear filter only requires a signal to noise ratio of $ \sim 18$.
