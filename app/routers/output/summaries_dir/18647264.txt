quantum steering --- a strong correlation to be verified even when one party or its measuring device is fully untrusted --- not only provides a profound insight into quantum physics but also offers a crucial basis for practical applications . for continuous - variable ( cv ) systems , gaussian states among others have been extensively studied , however , mostly confined to gaussian measurements . while the fulfillment of gaussian criterion is sufficient to detect cv steering , whether it is also necessary for gaussian states is a question of fundamental importance in many contexts . this critically questions the validity of characterizations established only under gaussian measurements like the quantification of steering and the monogamy relations . here , we introduce a formalism based on local uncertainty relations of non - gaussian measurements , which is shown to manifest quantum steering of some gaussian states that gaussian criterion fails to detect . to this aim , we look into gaussian states of practical relevance , i.e. two - mode squeezed states under a lossy and an amplifying gaussian channel . our finding significantly modifies the characteristics of gaussian - state steering so far established such as monogamy relations and one - way steering under gaussian measurements , thus opening a new direction for critical studies beyond gaussian regime .
