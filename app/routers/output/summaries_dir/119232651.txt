a recently proposed phase - estimation protocol that is based on measuring the parity of a two - mode squeezed - vacuum state at the output of a mach - zehnder interferometer shows that cram\'{e}r - rao bound sensitivity can be obtained [ p.\ m.\ anisimov , et al . , phys.\ rev.\ lett.\ { \bf104 } , 103602 ( 2010 ) ] . this sensitivity , however , is expected in the case of an infinite number of parity measurements made on an infinite number of photons . here we consider the case of a finite number of parity measurements and a finite number of photons , implemented with photon - number - resolving detectors . we use bayesian analysis to characterize the sensitivity of the phase estimation in this scheme . we have found that our phase estimation becomes biased near 0 or $ \pi/2 $ phase values . yet there is an in - between region where the bias becomes negligible . in this region , our phase estimation scheme saturates the cram\'{e}r - rao bound and beats the shot - noise limit .
