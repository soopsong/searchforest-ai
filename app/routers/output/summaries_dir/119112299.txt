we put forward two efficient entanglement concentration protocols ( ecps ) for distilling the maximally entangled noon state from arbitrary less - entangled noon state with only an auxiliary single photon . with the help of the weak cross - kerr nonlinearities , both the two ecps can be used repeatedly to get a high success probability . in the first ecp , the auxiliary single photon should be shared by the two parties say alice and bob . in the second ecp , the auxiliary single photon is only possessed by bob , which can greatly increase the practical success probability by avoiding the transmission loss . moreover , bob can operate the whole protocol alone , which makes the protocol more simple . therefore , our two ecps , especially the second ecp may be more useful and convenient in the current quantum information processing .
