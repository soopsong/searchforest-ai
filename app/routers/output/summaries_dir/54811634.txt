in this work we theoretically analyze a circuit qed design where propagating quantum microwaves interact with a single artificial atom , a single cooper pair box . in particular , we derive a master equation in the so - called transmon regime , including coherent drives . inspired by recent experiments , we then apply the master equation to describe the dynamics in both a two - level and a three - level approximation of the atom . in the two - level case , we also discuss how to measure photon antibunching in the reflected field and how it is affected by finite temperature and finite detection bandwidth .
