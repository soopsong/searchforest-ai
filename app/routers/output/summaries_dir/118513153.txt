we report experimental results on the action of selected local environments on the fidelity of the quantum teleportation protocol , taking into account non - ideal , realistic entangled resources . different working conditions are theoretically identified , where a noisy protocol can be made almost insensitive to further addition of noise . we put to test these conditions on a photonic implementation of the quantum teleportation algorithm , where two polarization entangled qubits act as the entangled resource and a path qubit on alice encodes the state to be teleported . bob 's path qubit is used to implement a local environment , while the environment on alice 's qubit is simulated as a weighed average of different pure states . we obtain a good agreement with the theoretical predictions , we experimentally recreate the conditions to obtain a noise - induced enhancement of the protocol fidelity , and we identify parameter regions of increased insensibility to interactions with specific noisy environments .
