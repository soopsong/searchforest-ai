first we make a brief review of coherent states and prove that the resolution of unity can be obtained by the 1-st chern character of some bundle . next we define a grassmann manifold for a set of coherent states and construct the pull - back bundle making use of a projector from the parameter space to this grassmann manifold . we study some geometric properties ( chern - characters mainly ) of these bundles . although the calculations of chern - characters are in general not easy , we can perform them for the special cases . in this paper we report our calculations and propose some interesting problems to be solved in the near future .
