renewed interest in deriving gravity ( more precisely , the einstein equations ) from thermodynamics considerations [ 1 , 2 ] is stirred up by a recent proposal that ' gravity is an entropic force ' [ 3 ] ( see also [ 4 ] ) . even though i find the arguments justifying such a claim in this latest proposal rather ad hoc and simplistic compared to the original one i would unreservedly support the call to explore deeper the relation between gravity and thermodynamics , this having the same spirit as my long - held view that general relativity is the hydrodynamic limit [ 5 , 6 ] of some underlying theories for the microscopic structure of spacetime - all these proposals , together with that of [ 7 , 8 ] , attest to the emergent nature of gravity [ 9 ] . in this first paper of two we set the modest goal of studying the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of classical matter only , bringing afore some interesting prior results , without invoking any quantum considerations such as bekenstein - hawking entropy , holography or unruh effect . this is for the sake of understanding the nonequilibrium nature of classical gravity which is at the root of many salient features of black hole physics . one important property of gravitational systems , from self - gravitating gas to black holes , is their negative heat capacity , which is the source of many out - of - the ordinary dynamical and thermodynamic features such as the non - existence in isolated systems of thermodynamically stable configurations , which actually provides the condition for gravitational stability . a related property is that , being systems with long range interaction , they are nonextensive and relax extremely slowly towards equilibrium . here we explore how much of the known features of black hole thermodynamics can be derived from this classical nonequilibrium perspective . a sequel paper will address gravity and nonequilibrium thermodynamics of quantum fields [ 10 ] .
