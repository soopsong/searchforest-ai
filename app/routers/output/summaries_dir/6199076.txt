we study the performance of leader - follower noisy consensus networks , and in particular , the relationship between this performance and the locations of the leader nodes . two types of dynamics are considered ( 1 ) noise - free leaders , in which leaders dictate the trajectory exactly and followers are subject to external disturbances , and ( 2 ) noise - corrupted leaders , in which both leaders and followers are subject to external perturbations . we measure the performance of a network by its coherence , an $ h_2 $ norm that quantifies how closely the followers track the leaders ' trajectory . for both dynamics , we show a relationship between the coherence and resistance distances in an a electrical network . using this relationship , we derive closed - form expressions for coherence as a function of the locations of the leaders . further , we give analytical solutions to the optimal leader selection problem for several special classes of graphs .
