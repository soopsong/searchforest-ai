let $ p_n$ and $ q_n$ be two probability measures representing two different probabilistic models of some system ( e.g. , an $ n$-particle equilibrium system , a set of random graphs with $ n$ vertices , or a stochastic process evolving over a time $ n$ ) and let $ m_n$ be a random variable representing a ' macrostate ' or ' global observable ' of that system . we provide sufficient conditions , based on the radon - nikodym derivative of $ p_n$ and $ q_n$ , for the set of typical values of $ m_n$ obtained relative to $ p_n$ to be the same as the set of typical values obtained relative to $ q_n$ in the limit $ n\rightarrow\infty$. this extends to general probability measures and stochastic processes the well - known thermodynamic - limit equivalence of the microcanonical and canonical ensembles , related mathematically to the asymptotic equivalence of conditional and exponentially - tilted measures . in this more general sense , two probability measures that are asymptotically equivalent predict the same typical or macroscopic properties of the system they are meant to model .
