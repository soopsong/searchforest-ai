we introduce a distributed classical simulation algorithm for general quantum circuits , and present numerical results for calculating the output probabilities of universal random circuits . we find that we can simulate more qubits to greater depth than previously reported using the cluster supported by the data infrastructure and search technology division of the alibaba group . for example , computing a single amplitude of an $ 8\times 8 $ qubit circuit with depth $ 40 $ was previously beyond the reach of supercomputers . our algorithm can compute this within $ 2 $ minutes using a small portion ( $ \approx$ 14 % of the nodes ) of the cluster . furthermore , by successfully simulating quantum supremacy circuits of size $ 9\times 9\times 40 $ , $ 10\times 10\times 35 $ , $ 11\times 11\times 31 $ , and $ 12\times 12\times 27 $ , we give evidence that noisy random circuits with realistic physical parameters may be simulated classically . this suggests that either harder circuits or error - correction may be vital for achieving quantum supremacy from random circuit sampling .
