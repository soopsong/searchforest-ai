the generation of random bits is of enormous importance in modern information science . cryptographic security is based on random numbers which require a physical process for their generation . this is commonly performed by hardware random number generators . these exhibit often a number of problems , namely experimental bias , memory in the system , and other technical subtleties , which reduce the reliability in the entropy estimation . further , the generated outcome has to be post - processed to"iron out"such spurious effects . here , we present a purely optical randomness generator , based on the bi - stable output of an optical parametric oscillator . detector noise plays no role and no further post - processing is required . upon entering the bi - stable regime , initially the resulting output phase depends on vacuum fluctuations . later , the phase is rigidly locked and can be well determined versus a pulse train , which is derived from the pump laser . this delivers an ambiguity - free output , which is reliably detected and associated with a binary outcome . the resulting random bit stream resembles a perfect coin toss and passes all relevant randomness measures . the random nature of the generated binary outcome is furthermore confirmed by an analysis of resulting conditional entropies .
