following the evolution of an open quantum system requires full knowledge of its dynamics . in this paper we consider open quantum systems for which the hamiltonian is ` ` uncertain ' ' . in particular , we treat in detail a simple system similar to that considered by mabuchi [ quant . semiclass . opt . 8 , 1103 ( 1996 ) ] : a radiatively damped atom driven by an unknown rabi frequency $ \omega$ ( as would occur for an atom at an unknown point in a standing light wave ) . by measuring the environment of the system , knowledge about the system state , and about the uncertain dynamical parameter , can be acquired . we find that these two sorts of knowledge acquisition ( quantified by the posterior distribution for $ \omega$ , and the conditional purity of the system , respectively ) are quite distinct processes , which are not strongly correlated . also , the quality and quantity of knowledge gain depend strongly on the type of monitoring scheme . we compare five different detection schemes ( direct , adaptive , homodyne of the $ x$ quadrature , homodyne of the $ y$ quadrature , and heterodyne ) using four different measures of the knowledge gain ( shannon information about $ \omega$ , variance in $ \omega$ , long - time system purity , and short - time system purity ) .
