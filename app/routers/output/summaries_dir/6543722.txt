we review the quantum theory of cooling of a mechanical oscillator subject to the radiation pressure force due to light circulating inside a driven optical cavity . such optomechanical setups have been used recently in a series of experiments by various groups to cool mechanical oscillators ( such as cantilevers ) by factors reaching $ 10^{5}$ , and they may soon go to the ground state of mechanical motion . we emphasize the importance of the sideband - resolved regime for ground state cooling , where the cavity ring - down rate is smaller than the mechanical frequency . moreover , we illustrate the strong coupling regime , where the cooling rate exceeds the cavity ring - down rate and where the driven cavity resonance and the mechanical oscillation hybridize .
