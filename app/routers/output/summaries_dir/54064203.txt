photons carrying a well - defined orbital angular momentum have been proven to modify spectroscopic selection rules in atomic matter . excitation profiles of electric quadrupole transitions have been measured with single trapped $ ^{40}$ca$^+$ ions for varying polarizations . we further develop the photo - absorption formalism to study the case of arbitrary alignment of the beam 's optical axis with respect to the ion 's quantization axis and mixed multipolarity . thus , predictions for m1-dominated $ ^{40}ar^{13+}$ , e3-driven $ ^{171}yb^+$ and $ ^{172}yb^+$ , and b - like $ ^{20}ne^{5+}$ are presented . the latter case displays novel effects , coming from the presence of a strong photon -- magnetic dipole coupling .
