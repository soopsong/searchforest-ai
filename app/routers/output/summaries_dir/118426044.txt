we investigate the phenomenon of bipartite entanglement revivals under purely local operations in systems subject to local and independent classical noise sources . we explain this apparent paradox in the physical ensemble description of the system state by introducing the concept of"hidden"entanglement , which indicates the amount of entanglement that can not be exploited due to the lack of classical information on the system . for this reason this part of entanglement can be recovered without the action of non - local operations or back - transfer process . for two noninteracting qubits under a low - frequency stochastic noise , we show that entanglement can be recovered by local pulses only . we also discuss how hidden entanglement may provide new insights about entanglement revivals in non - markovian dynamics .
