we investigate how to experimentally detect a recently proposed measure to quantify macroscopic quantum superpositions [ phys . rev . lett . 106 , 220401 ( 2011 ) ] , namely,"macroscopic quantumness"$\mathcal{i}$. schemes based on overlap measurements for harmonic oscillator states and for qubit states are extensively investigated . effects of detection inefficiency and coarse - graining are analyzed in order to assess feasibility of the schemes .
