we present a study of the performance of endoreversible thermal machines optimized with respect to the thermodynamic force associated with the cold bath in the regime of small thermodynamic forces . these thermal machines can work either as an engine or as a refrigerator . we analyze how the optimal performances are determined by the dependence of the thermodynamic flux on the forces . the results are motivated and illustrated with a quantum model , the three level maser , and explicit analytical expressions of the engine efficiency as a function of the system parameters are given .
