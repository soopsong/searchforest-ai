the laws of thermodynamics apply equally well to quantum systems as to classical systems , and because of this quantum effects do not change the fundamental thermodynamic efficiency of isothermal refrigerators or engines . we show that , despite this fact , quantum mechanics permits measurement - based feedback control protocols that are more thermodynamically efficient than their classical counterparts . as part of our analysis we perform a detailed accounting of the thermodynamics of unitary feedback control , and elucidate the sources of inefficiency in measurement - based and coherent feedback .
