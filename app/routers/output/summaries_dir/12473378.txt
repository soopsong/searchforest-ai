first , we present a bell type inequality for n qubits , assuming that m out of the n qubits are independent . quantum mechanics violates this inequality by a ratio that increases exponentially with m. hence an experiment on n qubits violating of this inequality sets a lower bound on the number m of entangled qubits . next , we propose a definition of maximally entangled states of n qubits . for this purpose we study 5 different criteria . four of these criteria are found compatible . for any number n of qubits , they determine an orthogonal basis consisting of maximally entangled states generalizing the bell states .
