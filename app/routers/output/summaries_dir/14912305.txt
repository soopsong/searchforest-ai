in this paper , we propose a method of enciphering quantum states of two - state systems ( qubits ) for sending them in secrecy without entangled qubits shared by two legitimate users ( alice and bob ) . this method has the following two properties . first , even if an eavesdropper ( eve ) steals qubits , she can extract information from them with certain probability at most . second , alice and bob can confirm that the qubits are transmitted between them correctly by measuring a signature . if eve measures m qubits one by one from n enciphered qubits and sends alternative ones ( the intercept / resend attack ) , a probability that alice and bob do not notice eve 's action is equal to ( 3/4)^m or less . passwords for decryption and the signature are given by classical binary strings and they are disclosed through a public channel . enciphering classical information by this method is equivalent to the one - time pad method with distributing a classical key ( random binary string ) by the bb84 protocol . if eve takes away qubits , alice and bob lose the original quantum information . if we apply our method to a state in iteration , eve 's success probability decreases exponentially . we can not examine security against the case that eve makes an attack with using entanglement . this remains to be solved in the future .
