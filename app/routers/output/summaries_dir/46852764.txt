we present a two - species laser cooling apparatus capable of simultaneously collecting rb and hg atomic gases into a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) . the atomic sources , laser system , and vacuum set - up are described . while there is a loss of rb atoms in the mot due to photoionization by the hg cooling laser , we show that it does not prevent simultaneous trapping of rb and hg . we also demonstrate interspecies collision - induced losses in the $ { } ^{87}$rb-${}^{202}$hg system .
