a general quantum thermodynamics network is composed of thermal devices connected to the environments through quantum wires . the coupling between the devices and the wires may introduce additional decay channels which modify the system performance with respect to the directly - coupled device . we analyze this effect in a quantum three - level device connected to a heat bath or to a work source through a two - level wire . the steady state heat currents are decomposed into the contributions of the set of simple circuits in the graph representing the master equation . each circuit is associated with a mechanism in the device operation and the system performance can be described by a small number of circuit representatives of those mechanisms . although in the limit of weak coupling between the device and the wire the new irreversible contributions can become small , they prevent the system from reaching the carnot efficiency .
