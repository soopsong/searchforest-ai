small quantum absorption refrigerators have recently attracted renewed attention . here we present a missing design of a two - qubit fridge , the main feature of which is that one of the two machine qubits is itself maintained at a temperature colder than the cold bath . this is achieved by ' reversing ' the couplings to the baths compared to previous designs , where only a transition is maintained cold . we characterize the working regime and the efficiency of the fridge . we demonstrate the soundness of the model by deriving and solving a master equation . finally , we discuss the performance of the fridge , in particular the heat current extracted from the cold bath . we show that our model performs comparably to the standard three - level quantum fridge , and thus appears appealing for possible implementations of nano thermal machines .
