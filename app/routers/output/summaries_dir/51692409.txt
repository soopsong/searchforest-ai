shortcuts to adiabaticity ( sta ) are techniques allowing rapid variation of the system hamiltonian without inducing excess heating . fast optical transfer of atoms between different locations is a prime example of an sta application . we show that the boundary conditions on the atomic position , which are imposed to find the sta trajectory , lead to highly non - practical boundary conditions for the optical trap . our experimental results demonstrate that , as a result , previously suggested sta trajectories generally do not perform well . we develop and demonstrate two complementary methods that solve the boundary conditions problem and allow the construction of realistic and flexible sta movements . our technique can also account for non - harmonic terms in the confining potential .
