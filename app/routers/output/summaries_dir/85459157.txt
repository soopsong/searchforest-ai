we develop a unified perspective of unidirectional topological edge waves in non - reciprocal media . we focus on the inherent role of photonic spin in non - reciprocal gyroelectric media , ie . magnetized metals or magnetized insulators . we first review the concept of a maxwell hamiltonian in non - reciprocal media , which immediately reveals that the gyrotropic coefficient behaves as a photon mass in two dimensions . similar to the dirac mass , this photonic mass opens bandgaps in the energy dispersion of bulk propagating waves . within these bulk photonic bandgaps , three distinct classes of maxwellian edge waves exist - each arising from subtle differences in boundary conditions . on one hand , the edge wave solutions are rigorous photonic analogs of jackiw - rebbi electronic edge states . on the other hand , for the exact same system , they can be high frequency photonic counterparts of the integer quantum hall effect , familiar at zero frequency . our hamiltonian approach also predicts the existence of a third distinct class of maxwellian edge wave exhibiting topological protection . the maxwellian edge state in this unique \textit{quantum gyroelectric phase of matter } necessarily requires a sign change in gyrotropy arising from non - locality ( spatial dispersion ) . a signature property of these topological electromagnetic edge states is that they are oblivious to the contacting medium , ie . they occur at the interface of the quantum gyroelectric phase and any medium ( even vacuum ) . furthermore , the maxwellian spin waves exhibit photonic spin-1 quantization in exact analogy with their supersymmetric spin-\sfrac{1}{2 } counterparts . the goal of this paper is to discuss these three foundational classes of edge waves in a unified perspective while providing in - depth derivations , taking into account non - locality and various boundary conditions .
