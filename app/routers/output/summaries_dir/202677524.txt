the advent of cloud quantum computing accelerates development of quantum algorithms . in particular , it is essential to study variational quantum - classical hybrid algorithms , which are executable on noisy intermediate - scale quantum ( nisq ) computers . evaluations of observables appear frequently in the variational quantum - classical hybrid algorithms for nisq computers . by speeding up the evaluation of observables , we can realize a faster algorithm and save resources of quantum computers . the grouping of observables with separable measurements has been conventionally used , and the grouping with entangled measurements has also been proposed recently by several teams . in this paper , we demonstrate that entangled measurements enhance the efficiency of evaluation of observables both theoretically and experimentally by taking into account the covariance effect , which may affect the quality of evaluations of observables . we also propose using a part of entangled measurements for grouping in order to keep the depth of extra gates constant . our proposed method is expected to be used in conjunction with other related studies . we hope that entangled measurements become crucial resources not only for joint measurements but also quantum information processing .
