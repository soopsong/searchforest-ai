quantum dot hybrid qubits formed from three electrons in double quantum dots represent a promising compromise between high speed and simple fabrication for solid state implementations of single qubit and two qubits quantum logic ports . we derive the schrieffer - wolff effective hamiltonian that describes in a simple and intuitive way the qubit by combining a hubbard - like model with a projector operator method . as a result , the hubbard - like hamiltonian is transformed in an equivalent expression in terms of the exchange coupling interactions between pairs of electrons . the effective hamiltonian is exploited to derive the dynamical behaviour of the system and its eigenstates on the bloch sphere to generate qubits operation for quantum logic ports . a realistic implementation in silicon and the coupling of the qubit with a detector are discussed .
