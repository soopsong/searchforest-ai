we study a three - node quantum network which enables bidirectional communication between two nodes with a half - duplex relay node . a decode - and - forward protocol is used to perform the communication in two phases . in the first phase , the messages of two nodes are transmitted to the relay node . in the second phase , the relay node broadcasts a re - encoded composition to the two nodes . we determine the capacity region of the broadcast phase .
