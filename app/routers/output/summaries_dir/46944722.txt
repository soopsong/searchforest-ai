we study the solutions of the interacting fermionic cellular automaton introduced in ref . [ phys rev a 97 , 032132 ( 2018 ) ] . the automaton is the analogue of the thirring model with both space and time discrete . we present a derivation of the two - particles solutions of the automaton , which exploits the symmetries of the evolution operator . in the two - particles sector , the evolution operator is given by the sequence of two steps , the first one corresponding to a unitary interaction activated by two - particle excitation at the same site , and the second one to two independent one - dimensional dirac quantum walks . the interaction step can be regarded as the discrete - time version of the interacting term of some hamiltonian integrable system , such as the hubbard or the thirring model . the present automaton exhibits scattering solutions with nontrivial momentum transfer , jumping between different regions of the brillouin zone that can be interpreted as fermion - doubled particles , in stark contrast with the customary momentum - exchange of the one dimensional hamiltonian systems . a further difference compared to the hamiltonian model is that there exist bound states for every value of the total momentum , and even for vanishing coupling constant . as a complement to the analytical derivations we show numerical simulations of the interacting evolution .
