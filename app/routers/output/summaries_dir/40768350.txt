noon states , states between two modes of light of the form $ |n,0\rangle+e^{i\phi}|0,n\rangle$ allow for super - resolution interformetry . we show how noon states can be efficiently produced in circuit quntum electrodynamics using superconducting phase qubits and resonators . we propose a protocol where only one interaction between the two modes is required , creating all the necessary entanglement at the start of the procedure . this protocol makes active use of the first three states of the phase qubits . additionally , we show how to efficiently verify the success of such an experiment , even for large noon states , using randomly sampled measurements and semidefinite programming techniques .
