given two or more non - commuting observables , it is generally not possible to simultaneously assign precise values to each . this quantum mechanical uncertainty principle is widely understood to be encapsulated by some form of uncertainty relation , expressing a trade - off between the standard deviations or other measures of uncertainty of two ( or more ) observables , resulting from their non - commutativity . typically , such relations are coarse , and miss important features . it was not until very recently that a broader perspective on quantum uncertainty was envisaged and explored , one that utilises the notion of an uncertainty region . here we review this new approach , illustrating it with pairs or triples of observables in the case of qubit and qutrit systems . we recall some of the shortcomings of traditional uncertainty relations , and highlight their inability to identify the full uncertainty region . these shortcomings suggest a precautionary note that , we surmise , ought to accompany the presentation of the uncertainty principle in introductory quantum mechanics courses .
