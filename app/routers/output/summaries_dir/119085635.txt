we calculate a measure of superposition macroscopicity $ \mathcal{m}$ for a superposition of screening current states in a superconducting flux qubit ( sfq ) , by relating $ \mathcal{m}$ to the action of an instanton trajectory connecting the potential wells of the flux qubit . when a magnetized bose - einstein condensed ( bec ) gas containing $ n_{b}\sim \mathcal{o}(10 ^ 6)$ atoms is brought into a $ \mathcal{o}(1)$ $ \mu\text{m}$ proximity of the flux qubit in an experimentally realistic geometry , we demonstrate the appearance of a two- to five - fold amplification of $ \mathcal{m}$ over the bare value without the bec , by calculating the instantion trajectory action from the microscopically derived effective flux lagrangian of a hybrid quantum system composed of the flux qubit and a spin-$f$ atomic bose gas . exploiting the connection between $ \mathcal m$ and the maximal metrological usefulness of a multimode superposition state , we show that amplification of $ \mathcal{m}$ in the ground state of the hybrid system is equivalent to a decrease in the quantum cram\'{e}r - rao bound for estimation of an externally applied flux . our result therefore demonstrates the increased usefulness of the bec -- sfq hybrid system as a sensor of ultraweak magnetic fields below the standard quantum limit .
