we experimentally demonstrate that both a converted and an unconverted light pulses after wavelength conversion with various conversion efficiencies preserve phase information of an input light at a single - photon level . in our experiment , we converted temporally - separated two coherent light pulses with average photon numbers of $ \sim$ 0.1 at 780 nm to light pulses at 1522 nm by using difference - frequency generation in a periodically - poled lithium niobate waveguide . we observed a single - photon interference between temporally - separated two modes for both the converted and the unconverted light pulses at various values of the conversion efficiency . we observed interference visibilities greater than 0.88 without suppressing the background noises for any value of the conversion efficiency the wavelength converter achieves . at a conversion efficiency of $ \sim$ 0.5 , the observed visibilities are 0.98 for the unconverted light and 0.99 for the converted light .
