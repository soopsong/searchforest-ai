using computational and theoretical approaches , we investigate the snap - through transition of buckled graphene membranes . our main interest is related to the possibility of using the buckled membrane as a plate of capacitor with memory ( memcapacitor ) . for this purpose , we performed molecular - dynamics ( md ) simulations and elasticity theory calculations of the up - to - down and down - to - up snap - through transitions for membranes of several sizes . we have obtained expressions for the threshold switching forces for both up - to - down and down - to - up transitions . moreover , the up - to - down threshold switching force was calculated using the density functional theory ( dft ) . our dft results are in general agreement with md and analytical theory findings . our systematic approach can be used for the description of other structures , including nanomechanical and biological ones , experiencing the snap - through transition .
