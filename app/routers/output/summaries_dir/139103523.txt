we study the entanglement of purification ( eop ) of subsystem $ a$ and b in conformal field theories ( cfts ) stressing on its relation to unitary operations of disentanglement , if the auxiliary subsystem $ \tilde{a}$ adjoins $ a$ and $ \tilde{a}\tilde{b}$ is the complement of $ ab$. we estimate the amount of the disentanglement by using the holographic eop conjecture as well as the inequality of von neumann entropy . denote the state that produces the eop by $ |\psi\rangle_m$. we calculate the variance of entanglement entropy of $ a\tilde{a}$ in the state $ |\psi(\delta)\rangle:=e^{i\delta h_{\tilde{a}\tilde{b}}}|\psi\rangle_m$. we find a constraint on the state $ |\psi\rangle_m$ , $ [ k_{a\tilde{a},m},o_{\tilde{a}}]=0 $ , where $ k_{a\tilde{a},m}$ is the modular hamiltonian of $ a\tilde{a}$ in the state $ |\psi\rangle_m$ , $ o_{\tilde{a}}\in \mathscr{r}(\tilde{a})$ is an arbitrary operator . we also study three different states that can be seen as disentangled states . two of them can produce the holographic eop result in some limit . but we show that none of they could be a candidate of the state $ |\psi\rangle_m$ , since the distance between these three states and $ |\psi\rangle_m$ is very large .
