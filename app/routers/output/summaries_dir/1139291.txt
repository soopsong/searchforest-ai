solid - state microcavities combining ultra - small mode volume , wide - range resonance frequency tuning , as well as lossless coupling to a single mode fibre are integral tools for nanophotonics and quantum networks . we developed an integrated system providing all of these three indispensable properties . it consists of a nanofibre bragg cavity ( nfbc ) with the mode volume of under 1 micro cubic meter and repeatable tuning capability over more than 20 nm at visible wavelengths . in order to demonstrate quantum light - matter interaction , we establish coupling of quantum dots to our tunable nfbc and achieve an emission enhancement by a factor of 2.7 .
