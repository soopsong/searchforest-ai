we theoretically demonstrate the mechanically mediated electromagnetically induced transparency in a two - mode cavity optomechanical system , where two cavity modes are coupled to a common mechanical resonator . when the two cavity modes are driven on their respective red sidebands by two pump beams , a transparency window appears in the probe transmission spectrum due to destructive interference . under this situation the transmitted probe beam can be delayed as much as 4 us , which can be easily controlled by the power of the pump beams . in addition , we also investigate the amplification of the transmitted probe beam owing to constructive interference when one cavity is driven on its blue sideband while another one is driven on its red sideband .
