we propose a scheme to realize deterministic quantum teleportation using linear optics and hybrid qubits . it enables one to efficiently perform teleportation and universal linear - optical gate operations in a simple and near - deterministic manner using all - optical hybrid entanglement as off - line resources . our analysis shows that our new approach can outperforms major previous ones when considering both the resource requirements and fault tolerance limits .
