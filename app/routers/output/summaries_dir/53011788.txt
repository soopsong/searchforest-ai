thermal attenuator channels model the decoherence of quantum systems interacting with a thermal bath , e.g. , a two - level system subject to thermal noise and an electromagnetic signal travelling through a fiber or in free - space . hence determining the quantum capacity of these channels is an outstanding open problem for quantum computation and communication . here we derive several upper bounds on the quantum capacity of qubit and bosonic thermal attenuators . we introduce an extended version of such channels which is degradable and hence has a single - letter quantum capacity , bounding that of the original thermal attenuators . another bound for bosonic attenuators is given by the bottleneck inequality applied to a particular channel decomposition . with respect to previously known bounds we report better results in a broad range of attenuation and noise : we can now approximate the quantum capacity up to a negligible uncertainty for most practical applications , e.g. , for low thermal noise .
