we present new constructions of codes for asymmetric channels for both binary and nonbinary alphabets , based on methods of generalized code concatenation . for the binary asymmetric channel , our methods construct nonlinear single - error - correcting codes from ternary outer codes . we show that some of the varshamov - tenengol'ts - constantin - rao codes , a class of binary nonlinear codes for this channel , have a nice structure when viewed as ternary codes . in many cases , our ternary construction yields even better codes . for the nonbinary asymmetric channel , our methods construct linear codes for many lengths and distances which are superior to the linear codes of the same length capable of correcting the same number of symmetric errors . in the binary case , varshamov has shown that almost all good linear codes for the asymmetric channel are also good for the symmetric channel . our results indicate that varshamov 's argument does not extend to the nonbinary case , i.e. , one can find better linear codes for asymmetric channels than for symmetric ones .
