we present two new constructions for the toffoli gate which substantially reduce resource costs in fault - tolerant quantum computing . the first contribution is a toffoli gate requiring clifford operations plus only four $ t = \exp(i\pi\sigma^z/8)$ gates , whereas conventional circuits require seven $ t$ gates . an extension of this result is that adding $ n$ control inputs to a controlled gate requires $ 4n$ $ t$ gates , whereas the best prior result was $ 8n$. the second contribution is a quantum circuit for the toffoli gate which can detect a single $ \sigma^z$ error occurring with probability $ p$ in any one of eight $ t$ gates required to produce the toffoli . by post - selecting circuits that did not detect an error , the posterior error probability is suppressed to lowest order from $ 4p$ ( or $ 7p$ , without the first contribution ) to $ 28p^2 $ for this enhanced construction . in fault - tolerant quantum computing , this construction can reduce the overhead for producing logical toffoli gates by an order of magnitude .
