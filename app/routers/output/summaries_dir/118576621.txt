in this paper , we consider the problem of discriminating quantum states by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) when an arbitrarily small amount of error is permitted . this paradigm is known as asymptotic state discrimination , and we derive necessary conditions for when two multipartite states of any size can be discriminated perfectly by asymptotic locc . we use this new criterion to prove a gap in the locc and separable distinguishability norms . we then turn to the operational advantage of using two - way classical communication over one - way communication in locc processing . with a simple two - qubit product state ensemble , we demonstrate a strict majorization of the two - way locc norm over the one - way norm .
