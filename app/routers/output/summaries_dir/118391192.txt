in this review , we discuss recent experiments that investigate how the quantum sate of a superconducting qubit evolves during measurement . we provide a pedagogical overview of the measurement process , when the qubit is dispersively coupled to a microwave frequency cavity , and the qubit state is encoded in the phase of a microwave tone that probes the cavity . a continuous measurement record is used to reconstruct the individual quantum trajectories of the qubit state , and quantum state tomography is performed to verify that the state has been tracked accurately . furthermore , we discuss ensembles of trajectories , time - symmetric evolution , two - qubit trajectories , and potential applications in measurement - based quantum error correction .
