for a discrete two - state quantum walk ( qw ) on the half - line with a general condition at the boundary , we formulate and prove a weak limit theorem describing the terminal behavior of its transition probabilities . in this context , localization is possible even for a walk predicated on the assumption of homogeneity . for the hadamard walk on the half - line , the weak limit is shown to be independent of the initial coin state and to exhibit no localization .
