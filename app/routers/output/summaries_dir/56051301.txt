mounting experimental and theoretical evidence suggests that coherent quantum effects play a role in the efficient transfer of an excitation from a chlorosome antenna to a reaction center in the fenna - matthews - olson protein complex . however , it is conceivable that a satisfying alternate interpretation of the results is possible in terms of a classical theory . to address this possibility , we consider a class of classical theories satisfying the minimal postulates of macrorealism and frame leggett - garg - type tests that could rule them out . our numerical simulations indicate that even in the presence of decoherence , several tests could exhibit the required violations of the leggett - garg inequality . remarkably , some violations persist even at room temperature for our decoherence model .
