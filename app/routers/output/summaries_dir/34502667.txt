we investigate correlations among complementary observables . in particular , we show how to take advantage of mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) for the efficient detection of entanglement in arbitrarily high - dimensional , multipartite and continuous variable quantum systems . the introduced entanglement criteria are relatively easy to implement experimentally since they require only a few local measurement settings . in addition , we establish a link between the separability problem and the maximum number of mutually unbiased bases -- opening a new avenue in this long - standing open problem .
