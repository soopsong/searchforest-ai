experimental evidence shows that a variety of photosynthetic systems can preserve quantum beats in the process of electronic energy transfer , even at room temperature . however , whether this quantum coherence arises in vivo and whether it has any biological function have remained unclear . here we present a theoretical model that suggests that the creation and recreation of coherence under natural conditions is ubiquitous . our model allows us to theoretically demonstrate a mechanism for a ratchet effect enabled by quantum coherence , in a design inspired by an energy transfer pathway in the fenna - matthews - olson complex of the green sulfur bacteria . this suggests a possible biological role for coherent oscillations in spatially directing energy transfer . our results emphasize the importance of analyzing long - range energy transfer in terms of transfer between inter - complex coupling ( icc ) states rather than between site or exciton states .
