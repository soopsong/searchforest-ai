the experimental realization of majorana fermions presents an important problem due to their non - abelian nature and potential exploitation for topological quantum computation . very recently sau et al . [ arxiv:0907.2239 ] demonstrated that a topological superconducting phase supporting majorana fermions can be realized using surprisingly conventional building blocks : a semiconductor quantum well coupled to an s - wave superconductor and a ferromagnetic insulator . here we propose an alternative setup , wherein a topological superconducting phase is driven by applying an in - plane magnetic field to a ( 110)-grown semiconductor coupled only to an s - wave superconductor . this device offers a number of advantages , notably a simpler architecture and the ability to tune across a quantum phase transition into the topological superconducting state , while still largely avoiding unwanted orbital effects . experimental feasibility of both setups is discussed in some detail .
