this paper considers the observability of nonlinear systems from a koopman operator theoretic perspective -- and in particular -- the effect of symmetry on observability . we first examine an infinite - dimensional linear system ( constructed using independent koopman eigenfunctions ) such that its observability is equivalent to the observability of the original nonlinear system . next , we derive an analytic relation between symmetry and nonlinear observability ; it is shown that symmetry in the nonlinear dynamics is reflected in the symmetry of the corresponding koopman eigenfunctions , as well as presence of repeated koopman eigenvalues . we then proceed to show that the loss of observability in symmetric nonlinear systems can be traced back to the presence of these repeated eigenvalues . in the case where we have a sufficient number of measurements , the nonlinear system remains unobservable when these functions have symmetries that mirror those of the dynamics . the proposed observability framework provides insights into the minimum number of the measurements needed to make an unobservable nonlinear system , observable . the proposed results are then applied to a network of nano - electromechanical oscillators coupled via a symmetric interaction topology .
