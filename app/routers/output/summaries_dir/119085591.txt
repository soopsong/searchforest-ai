quantum coherence is a basic feature of quantum physics . combined with tensor product structure of state space , it gives rise to the novel concepts such as entanglement and quantum correlations , which play a crucial role in quantum information processing tasks . however , quantum correlations , especially entanglement , are fragile under decoherence . in this context , very few investigations have touched on the production of quantum coherence by quantum operations . in this paper , we study cohering power -- the ability of quantum operations to produce coherence . first , we provide an operational interpretation of cohering power . then , we decompose a generic quantum operation into three basic operations , namely , unitary , appending and dismissal operations , and show that the cohering power of any quantum operation is upper bounded by the corresponding unitary operation . furthermore , we compare cohering power and generalized cohering power of quantum operations for different measures of coherence .
