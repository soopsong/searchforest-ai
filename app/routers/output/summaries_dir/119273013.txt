photon number resolving detectors can be highly useful for studying the statistics of multi - photon quantum states of light . in this work we study the counts statistics of different states of light measured on multiplexed on - off detectors . we put special emphasis on artificial nonclassical features of the statistics obtained . we show new ways to derive analytical formulas for counts statistics and their moments . using our approach we are the first to derive statistics moments for multi - mode thermal states measured on multiplexed on - off detectors . we use them to determine empirical mandel parameters and recently proposed subbinomial parameters suitable for tests of nonclassicality of the measured states . additionally , we investigate subpoissonian and superbunching properties of the two - mode squeezed state measured on a pair of multiplexed detectors and we present results of the fano factor and second - order correlation function for these states .
