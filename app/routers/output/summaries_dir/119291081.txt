we investigate a bunch of d0-branes to reveal its quantum nature from the gravity side . in the classical limit , it is well described by a non - extremal black 0-brane in type iia supergravity . the solution is uplifted to the eleven dimensions and expressed by a non - extremal m - wave solution . after reviewing the effective action for the m - theory , we explicitly solve the equations of motion for the near horizon geometry of the m - wave . as a result we derive an unique solution which includes the effect of the quantum gravity . thermodynamic property of the quantum near horizon geometry of the black 0-brane is also studied by using wald 's formula . combining our result with that of the monte carlo simulation of the dual thermal gauge theory , we find strong evidence for the gauge / gravity duality in the d0-branes system at the level of quantum gravity .
