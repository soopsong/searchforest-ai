quantum key distribution ( qkd ) allows to share random keys between two users with unconditional security : the key is usually generated by exchanging a stream of photons . the long - term vision of qkd is represented by a quantum network , implemented by fiber and free - space links involving ground and/or satellites stations . the presence of the atmospheric turbulence represents an obstacle for free - space quantum communications , due to the increase of optical losses . here we introduce a method to exploit the atmospheric turbulence as a resource for qkd . an adaptive real time selection ( arts ) technique at the receiver allows to take advantage of the fluctuating transmissivity of the channel , giving rise to an increase of the secure key rate .
