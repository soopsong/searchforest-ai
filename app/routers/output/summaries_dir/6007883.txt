we study an autonomous quantum system which exhibits refrigeration under an information - work trade - off like a maxwell demon . the system becomes correlated as a single"demon"qubit interacts sequentially with memory qubits while in contact with two heat reservoirs of different temperatures . using strong subadditivity of the von neumann entropy , we derive a global clausius inequality to show thermodynamic advantages from access to correlated information . it is demonstrated , in a matrix product density operator formalism , that our demon can simultaneously realize refrigeration against a thermal gradient and erasure of information from its memory , which is impossible without correlations . the phenomenon can be even enhanced by the presence of quantum coherence .
