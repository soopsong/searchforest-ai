we explore the cosmological implications of quantum entanglement between two causally disconnected universes in the multiverse . we first consider two causally separated de sitter spaces with a state which is initially entangled . we derive the reduced density matrix of our universe and compute the spectrum of vacuum fluctuations . we then consider the same system with an initially non - entangled state . we find that scale dependent modulations may enter the spectrum for the case of initially non - entangled state due to quantum interference . this gives rise to the possibility that the existence of causally disconnected universes may be experimentally tested by analyzing correlators in detail .
