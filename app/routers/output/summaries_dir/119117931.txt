we present calculations of contact potential surface patch effects that simplify previous treatments . it is shown that , because of the linearity of laplace 's equation , the presence of patch potentials does not affect an electrostatic calibration ( of force and/or distance ) of a two - plate casimir measurement apparatus . using models that include long - range variations in the contact potential across the plate surfaces , a number of experimental observations can be reproduced and explained . for these models , numerical calculations show that if a voltage is applied between the plates which minimizes the force , a residual electrostatic force persists , and that the minimizing potential varies with distance . the residual force can be described by a fit to a simple two - parameter function involving the minimizing potential and its variation with distance . we show the origin of this residual force by use of a simple parallel capacitor model . finally , the implications of a residual force that varies in a manner different from 1 / d on the accuracy of previous casimir measurements is discussed .
