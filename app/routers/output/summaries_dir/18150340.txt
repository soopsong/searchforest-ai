parity - time ( pt ) symmetry is of great interest . the reciprocal and unidirectional features are intriguing besides the pt symmetry phase transition . recently , the reciprocal transmission , unidirectional reflectionless and invisibility are intensively studied . here , we show the reciprocal reflection / transmission in pt -symmetric system is closely related to the type of pt symmetry , that is , the axial ( reflection ) pt symmetry leads to reciprocal reflection ( transmission ) . the results are further elucidated by studying the scattering of rhombic ring form coupled resonators with enclosed synthetic magnetic flux . the nonreciprocal phase shift induced by the magnetic flux and gain / loss break the parity ( p ) and time - reversal ( t ) symmetry but keep the parity - time ( pt ) symmetry . the reciprocal reflection ( transmission ) and unidirectional transmission ( reflection ) are found in the axial ( reflection ) pt - symmetric ring center . the explorations of symmetry and asymmetry from pt symmetry may shed light on novel one - way optical devices and application of pt metamaterials .
