we propose a whole family of physical states that yield a violation of the bell chsh inequality arbitrarily close to its maximum value , when using quadrature phase homodyne detection . this result is based on a new binning process called root binning , that is used to transform the continuous variables measurements into binary results needed for the tests of quantum mechanics versus local realistic theories . a physical process in order to produce such states is also suggested . the use of high - efficiency spacelike separated homodyne detections with these states and this binning process would result in a conclusive loophole - free test of quantum mechanics .
