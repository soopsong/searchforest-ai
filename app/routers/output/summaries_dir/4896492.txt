we show how spin - spin correlations , detected in a non - destructive way via spatially resolved quantum polarization spectroscopy , strongly characterize various phases realized in trapped ultracold fermionic atoms . polarization degrees of freedom of the light couple to spatially resolved components of the atomic spin . in this way quantum fluctuations of matter are faithfully mapped onto those of light . in particular we demonstrate that quantum spin polarization spectroscopy provides a direct method to detect the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov phase realized in a one - dimensional imbalanced fermi system .
