we investigate the effect of coherence to the excitation transfer efficiency ( ete ) in photosynthetic bacteria chlorobium tepidum . we have modeled the monomer of fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex as consisting of eight bacteriochlorophyll - a sites , while explicitly consider reaction center core complex ( rcc ) as an additional site . with the use of realistic bath spectrum and several dominant vibronic modes in the non - markovian master equation , in an effective 9-site model , we have compared the ete for an initial pure state and an initial mixed state . we observe that the initial pure state relaxes efficiently to increase the trapping at the rcc . we further illustrate that the coherence play a competitive role to block the back transfer of excitation from rcc pigment to fmo complex and hence to maximize the ete .
