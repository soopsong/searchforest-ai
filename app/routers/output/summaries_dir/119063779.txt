with the significant advancement in quantum computation in the past couple of decades , the exploration of machine - learning subroutines using quantum strategies has become increasingly popular . gaussian process regression is a widely used technique in supervised classical machine learning . here we introduce an algorithm for gaussian process regression using continuous - variable quantum systems that can be realized with technology based on photonic quantum computers under certain assumptions regarding distribution of data and availability of efficient quantum access . our algorithm shows that by using a continuous - variable quantum computer a dramatic speed - up in computing gaussian process regression can be achieved , i.e. , the possibility of exponentially reducing the time to compute . furthermore , our results also include a continuous - variable quantum - assisted singular value decomposition method of non - sparse low rank matrices and forms an important subroutine in our gaussian process regression algorithm .
