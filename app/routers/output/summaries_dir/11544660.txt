integrated quantum optics has drastically reduced the size of table - top optical experiments to the chip - scale , allowing for demonstrations of large - scale quantum information processing and quantum simulation . however , despite these advances , practical implementations of quantum photonic circuits remain limited because they consist of large networks of waveguide interferometers that path encode information which do not easily scale . increasing the dimensionality of current quantum systems using higher degrees of freedom such as transverse spatial field distribution , polarization , time , and frequency to encode more information per carrier will enable scalability by simplifying quantum computational architectures , increasing security and noise tolerance in quantum communication channels , and simulating richer quantum phenomena . here we demonstrate a scalable platform for photonic quantum information processing using waveguide quantum circuit building blocks based on the transverse spatial mode degree of freedom : mode multiplexers and mode beamsplitters . a multimode waveguide is inherently a densely packed system of spatial and polarization modes that can be coupled by perturbations to the waveguide . we design a multimode waveguide consisting of three spatial modes ( per polarization ) and a nanoscale grating beamsplitter to show tunable quantum interference between pairs of photons in different transverse spatial modes . we also cascade these structures and demonstrate noon state interferometry within a multimode waveguide . these devices have potential to perform transformations on more modes and be integrated with existing architectures , providing a scalable path to higher - dimensional hilbert spaces and entanglement .
