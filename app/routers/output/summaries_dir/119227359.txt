counterfactual communication , i.e. , communication without particle travelling in the transmission channel , is a bizarre quantum effect . starting from interaction - free measurements many protocols achieving various tasks from counterfactual cryptogrphy to counterfactual transfer of quantum states were proposed and implemented in experiments . however , the meaning of conterfactuality in various protocols remained a controversial topic . a simple error - free counterfactual protocol is proposed . this protocol and its modification are used as a test bed for analysis of meaning of counterfactuality to clarify the counterfactuality status of various counterfactual proposals .
