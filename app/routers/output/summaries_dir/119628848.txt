unruh - dewitt detectors interacting locally with a quantum field are systems under consideration for relativistic quantum information processing . in most works , the detectors are assumed to be point - like and , therefore , couple with the same strength to all modes of the field spectrum . we propose the use of a more realistic detector model where the detector has a finite size conveniently tailored by a spatial profile . we design a spatial profile such that the detector , when inertial , naturally couples to a peaked distribution of minkowski modes . in the uniformly accelerated case , the detector couples to a peaked distribution of rindler modes . such distributions are of special interest in the analysis of entanglement in non - inetial frames . we use our detector model to show the noise detected in the minkowski vacuum and in single particle states is a function of the detector 's acceleration .
