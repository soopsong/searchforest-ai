a quantum memory is a system that enables transfer , storage , and retrieval of optical quantum states by on / off switching of the control signal in each stages of the memory . in particular , it is known that , for perfect transfer of a single - photon state , appropriate shaping of the input pulse is required . however , in general , such a desirable pulse shape has a complicated form , which would be hard to generate in practice . in this paper , for a wide class of linear quantum memory systems , we develop a method that reduces the complexity of the input pulse shape of a single - photon while maintaining the perfect state transfer . the key idea is twofold ; ( i ) the control signal is allowed to vary continuously in time to introduce an additional degree of freedom , and then ( ii ) an optimal control problem is formulated to design a simple - formed input pulse and the corresponding control signal . numerical simulations are conducted for lambda - type atomic media and a networked atomic ensembles , to show the effectiveness of the proposed method .
