there is recently a surge of interest to cut down the time it takes to change the state of a quantum system adiabatically . we study for the time - dependent harmonic oscillator the transient energy excitation in speed - up processes designed to reproduce the initial populations at some predetermined final frequency and time , providing lower bounds and examples . implications for the limits imposed to the process times and for the principle of unattainability of the absolute zero , in a single expansion or in quantum refrigerator cycles , are drawn .
