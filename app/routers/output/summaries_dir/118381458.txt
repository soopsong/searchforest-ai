we propose a physical implementation of time and spatial parity transformations , as well as galilean boosts , in a trapped - ion quantum simulator . by embedding the simulated model into an enlarged simulating hilbert space , these fundamental symmetry operations can be fully realized and measured with ion traps . we illustrate our proposal with analytical and numerical techniques of prototypical examples with state - of - the - art trapped - ion platforms . these results pave the way for the realization of time and spatial parity transformations in other models and quantum platforms .
