we present a method to calculate the real time effective propagator of a generic open quantum system , immersed in a medium using a wave function based framework . the medium is characterised by a set of harmonic oscillators having a continuous span of frequencies . this technique has been applied to the caldeira - leggett model showing that high frequency modes of the medium do not contribute towards decay of the population of states of the open system . in fact , they cause a rabi type oscillation . moreover , our wave function based approach provides an excellent alternative to conventional formalisms involving the density matrix .
