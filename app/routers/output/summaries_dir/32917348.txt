topological insulators are fascinating states of matter exhibiting protected edge states and robust quantized features in their bulk . here , we propose and validate experimentally a method to detect topological properties in the bulk of one - dimensional chiral systems . we first introduce the mean chiral displacement , and we show that it rapidly approaches a multiple of the zak phase in the long time limit . then we measure the zak phase in a photonic quantum walk , by direct observation of the mean chiral displacement in its bulk . next , we measure the zak phase in an alternative , inequivalent timeframe , and combine the two windings to characterize the full phase diagram of this floquet system . finally , we prove the robustness of the measure by introducing dynamical disorder in the system . this detection method is extremely general , as it can be applied to all one - dimensional platforms simulating static or floquet chiral systems .
