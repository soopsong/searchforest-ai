in quantum key distribution implementations , each session is typically chosen long enough so that the secret key rate approaches its asymptotic limit . however , this choice may be constrained by the physical scenario , as in the perspective use with satellites , where the passage of one terminal over the other is restricted to a few minutes . here we demonstrate experimentally the extraction of secure keys leveraging an optimal design of the prepare - and - measure scheme , according to recent finite - key theoretical tight - bounds . the experiment is performed in different channel conditions , and assuming two distinct attack models : individual attacks , or general quantum attacks . the request on the number of exchanged qubits is then obtained as a function of the key size and of the ambient quantum bit error rate . the results indicate that viable conditions for effective symmetric , and even one - time - pad , cryptography are achievable .
