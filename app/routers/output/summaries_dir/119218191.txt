a quantum memory at microwave frequencies , able to store the state of multiple superconducting qubits for long times , is a key element for quantum information processing . electronic and nuclear spins are natural candidates for the storage medium as their coherence time can be well above one second . benefiting from these long coherence times requires to apply the refocusing techniques used in magnetic resonance , a major challenge in the context of hybrid quantum circuits . here we report the first implementation of such a scheme , using ensembles of nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centres in diamond coupled to a superconducting resonator , in a setup compatible with superconducting qubit technology . we implement the active reset of the nv spins into their ground state by optical pumping and their refocusing by hahn echo sequences . this enables the storage of multiple microwave pulses at the picowatt level and their retrieval after up to $ 35 \mu$s , a three orders of magnitude improvement compared to previous experiments .
