we theoretically analyze antibunching of the phonon field in an optomechanical oscillator employ- ing the membrane - in - the - middle geometry . more specifically , a single - mode mechanical oscillator is quadratically coupled to a single - mode cavity field in the regime in which the cavity dissipation is a dominant source of damping , and adiabatic elimination of the cavity field leads to an effective cubic nonlinearity for the mechanics . we show analytically in the weak coupling regime that the mechan- ics displays a chaotic phonon field for small optomechanical cooperativity , whereas an antibunched single - phonon field appears for large optomechanical cooperativity . this opens the door to control of the second - order correlation function of a mechanical oscillator in the weak coupling regime .
