we give a systematic theoretical description of homodyne detection in the case where both the signal and the local oscillator pass through the turbulent atmosphere . imperfect knowledge of the local - oscillator amplitude is effectively included in a noisy density operator , leading to postprocessing noise . alternatively , we propose a technique with monitored transmission coefficient of the atmosphere , which is free of postprocessing noise .
