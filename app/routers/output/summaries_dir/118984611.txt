we compute holographic complexity of charged black brane solutions in arbitrary dimensions for the near horizon limit of near extremal case using two different methods . the corresponding complexity may be obtained either by taking the limit from the complexity of the charged black brane , or by computing the complexity for near horizon limit of near extremal solution . one observes that these results coincide if one assumes to have a cutoff behind horizon whose value is fixed by uv cutoff and also taking into account a proper counterterm evaluated on this cutoff . we also consider the situation for vaidya charged black branes too .
