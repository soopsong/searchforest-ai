quantum coherence plays a central role in various research areas . the $ l_1$-norm of coherence is one of the most important coherence measures that are easily computable , but it is not easy to find a simple interpretation . we show that the $ l_1$-norm of coherence is uniquely characterized by a few simple axioms , which demonstrates in a precise sense that it is the analog of negativity in entanglement theory and sum negativity in the resource theory of magic - state quantum computation . we also provide an operational interpretation of the $ l_1$-norm of coherence as the maximum entanglement , measured by the negativity , produced by incoherent operations acting on the system and an incoherent ancilla . to achieve this goal , we clarify the relation between the $ l_1$-norm of coherence and negativity for all bipartite states , which leads to an interesting generalization of maximally correlated states . surprisingly , all entangled states thus obtained are distillable . moreover , their entanglement cost and distillable entanglement can be computed explicitly for a qubit - qudit system .
