we suggest a type of attack on quantum cryptosystems that exploits variations in detector efficiency as a function of a control parameter accessible to an eavesdropper . with gated single - photon detectors , this control parameter can be the timing of the incoming pulse . when the eavesdropper sends short pulses using the appropriate timing so that the two gated detectors in bob 's setup have different efficiencies , the security of quantum key distribution can be compromised . specifically , we show for the bennett - brassard 1984 ( bb84 ) protocol that if the efficiency mismatch between 0 and 1 detectors for some value of the control parameter gets large enough ( roughly 15:1 or larger ) , eve can construct a successful faked - states attack causing a quantum bit error rate lower than 11 % . we also derive a general security bound as a function of the detector sensitivity mismatch for the bb84 protocol . experimental data for two different detectors are presented , and protection measures against this attack are discussed .
