a theoretical scheme for the realization of the sphere - coherent motional states in an optomechanical cavity in the presence of a two - level atom is proposed . to this end , the analogy between an atom - assisted optomechanical cavity and a laser - driven trapped - ion system is used . this analogy provides us with a theoretical tool to show how sphere - coherent states can be generated for the motional degree of freedom of the macroscopic mechanical oscillator from atom - field - mirror interactions in a multi - mode optomechanical cavity . some nonclassical properties of the generated state of the mechanical oscillator , including the degree of quadrature squeezing and the negativity of the wigner distribution are studied . we also examine the effects of the dissipation mechanisms involved in the system under consideration , including the atomic spontaneous emission and the damping of the motion of the mechanical oscillator , on the generated motional sphere - coherent states .
