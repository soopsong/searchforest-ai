we consider discrete - time quantum systems subject to quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurements and controlled by an adjustable unitary evolution between two successive qnd measures . in open - loop , such qnd measurements provide a non - deterministic preparation tool exploiting the back - action of the measurement on the quantum state . we propose here a systematic method based on elementary graph theory and inversion of laplacian matrices to construct strict control - lyapunov functions . this yields an appropriate feedback law that stabilizes globally the system towards a chosen target state among the open - loop stable ones , and that makes in closed - loop this preparation deterministic . we illustrate such feedback laws through simulations corresponding to an experimental setup with qnd photon counting .
