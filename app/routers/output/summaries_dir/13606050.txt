this paper establishes that generic linear quantum stochastic systems have a pure cascade realization of their transfer function , generalizing an earlier result established only for the special class of completely passive linear quantum stochastic systems . in particular , a cascade realization therefore exists for generic active linear quantum stochastic systems that require an external source of quanta to operate . the results facilitate a simplified realization of generic linear quantum stochastic systems for applications such as coherent feedback control and optical filtering . the key tools that are developed are algorithms for symplectic qr and schur decompositions . it is shown that generic real square matrices of even dimension can be transformed into a lower $ 2 \times 2 $ block triangular form by a symplectic similarity transformation . the linear algebraic results herein may be of independent interest for applications beyond the problem of transfer function realization for quantum systems . numerical examples are included to illustrate the main results . in particular , one example describes an equivalent realization of the transfer function of a nondegenerate parametric amplifier as the cascade interconnection of two degenerate parametric amplifiers with an additional outcoupling mirror .
