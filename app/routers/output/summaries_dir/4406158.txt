the downscaling of optical systems to the micro and nano - scale results in very compliant systems with nanogram - scale masses , which renders them susceptible to optical forces . here we show a specially designed resonant structure for enabling efficient static control of the optical response with relatively weak repulsive and attractive optical forces . using attractive gradient optical forces we demonstrate a static mechanical deformation of up to 20 nanometers in the resonator structure . this deformation is enough to shift the optical resonances by roughly 80 optical linewidths .
