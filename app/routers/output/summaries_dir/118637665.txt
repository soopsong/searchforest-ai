quantum computation offers exciting new possibilities for statistics . this paper explores the use of the d - wave machine , a specialized type of quantum computer , which performs quantum annealing . a general description of quantum annealing through the use of the d - wave is given , along with technical issues to be encountered . quantum annealing is used to perform maximum likelihood estimation , generate an experimental design , and perform matrix inversion . though the results show that quantum computing is still at an early stage which is not yet superior to classical computation , there is promise for quantum computation in the future .
