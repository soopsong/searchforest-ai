we study theoretically and experimentally the response of a microwave superconducting stripline resonator , integrated with a microbridge , to a monochromatic injected signal . we find that there is a certain range of driving parameters , in which a novel nonlinear phenomenon immerges , and self - sustained modulation of the reflected power off the resonator is generated by the resonator . a theoretical model which attributes the self modulation to a thermal instability yields a good agreement with the experimental results .
