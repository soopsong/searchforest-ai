we propose an experimental scheme to implement a strong photon blockade with a single quantum dot coupled to a nanocavity . the photon blockade effect can be tremendously enhanced by driving the cavity and the quantum dot simultaneously with two classical laser fields . this enhancement of photon blockade is ascribed to the quantum interference effect to avoid two - photon excitation of the cavity field . comparing with jaynes - cummings model , the second - order correlation function at zero time delay $ g^{(2)}(0)$ in our scheme can be reduced by two orders of magnitude and the system sustains a large intracavity photon number . a red ( blue ) cavity - light detuning asymmetry for photon quantum statistics with bunching or antibunching characteristics is also observed . the photon blockade effect has a controllable flexibility by tuning the relative phase between the two pumping laser fields and the rabi coupling strength between the quantum dot and the pumping field . moreover , the photon blockade scheme based on quantum interference mechanism does not require a strong coupling strength between the cavity and the quantum dot , even with the pure dephasing of the system . this simple proposal provides an effective way for potential applications in solid state quantum computation and quantum information processing .
