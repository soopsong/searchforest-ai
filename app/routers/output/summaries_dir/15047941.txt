we propose a new technique , called quantum optical coherence tomography ( qoct ) , for carrying out tomographic measurements with dispersion - cancelled resolution . the technique can also be used to extract the frequency - dependent refractive index of the medium . qoct makes use of a two - photon interferometer in which a swept delay permits a coincidence interferogram to be traced . the technique bears a resemblance to classical optical coherence tomography ( oct ) . however , it makes use of a nonclassical entangled twin - photon light source that permits measurements to be made at depths greater than those accessible via oct , which suffers from the deleterious effects of sample dispersion . aside from the dispersion cancellation , qoct offers higher sensitivity than oct as well as an enhancement of resolution by a factor of 2 for the same source bandwidth . qoct and oct are compared using an idealized sample .
