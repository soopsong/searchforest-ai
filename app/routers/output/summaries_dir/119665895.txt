we provide an analysis of the correlation properties of spin and fermionic systems on a lattice evolving according to open system dynamics generated by a local primitive liouvillian . we show that if the liouvillian has a spectral gap which is independent of the system size , then the correlations between local observables decay exponentially as a function of the distance between their supports . we prove , furthermore , that if the log - sobolev constant is independent of the system size , then the system satisfies clustering of correlations in the mutual information - a much more stringent form of correlation decay . as a consequence , in the latter case we get an area law ( with logarithmic corrections ) for the mutual information . as a further corollary , we obtain a stability theorem for local distant perturbations . we also demonstrate that gapped free - fermionic systems exhibit clustering of correlations in the covariance and in the mutual information . we conclude with a discussion of the implications of these results for the classical simulation of open quantum systems with matrix - product operators and the robust dissipative preparation of topologically ordered states of lattice spin systems .
