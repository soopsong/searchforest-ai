we report a novel and simple approach for generating near - perfect quality polarization entanglement in a fully guided - wave fashion . both deterministic pair separation into two adjacent telecommunication channels and the paired photons ' temporal walk - off compensation are achieved using standard fiber components . two - photon interference experiments are performed , both for quantitatively demonstrating the relevance of our approach , and for manipulating the produced state between bosonic and fermionic symmetries . the compactness , versatility , and reliability of this configuration makes it a potential candidate for quantum communication applications .
