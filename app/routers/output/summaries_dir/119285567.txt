we study the entanglement entropy s_{ab } of a massless free scalar field on two spheres a and b whose radii are r_1 and r_2 , respectively , and the distance between the centers of them is r. the state of the massless free scalar field is the vacuum state . we obtain the result that the mutual information s_{a;b}:=s_a+s_b - s_{ab } is independent of the ultraviolet cutoff and proportional to the product of the areas of the two spheres when r>>r_1,r_2 , where s_a and s_b are the entanglement entropy on the inside region of a and b , respectively . we discuss possible connections of this result with the physics of black holes .
