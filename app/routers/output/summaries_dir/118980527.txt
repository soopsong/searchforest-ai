in this paper , we construct and calculate a non - perturbative path integrals in a multiply - connected space - time . this is done by by summing over homotopy classes of paths . the topology of the space - time is defined by einstein - rosen bridges ( erb ) forming from the entanglement of quantum foam described by virtual black holes . as these ` bubbles ' are entangled , they ar econnected by plankian erb 's because of the $ er = epr$ conjecture . hence the space - time will possess a large first betti number $ b1$. for any compact 2-surface in the space - time , the topology ( in particular the homotopy ) of that surface is not - trivial , due to the large number of plankian erb 's that define homotopy though this surface . the quantisation of space - time with this topology - along with the proper choice of the 2-surfaces - is conjectured to allow anon - perturbative path integrals of quantum gravity theory over the space - time manifold .
