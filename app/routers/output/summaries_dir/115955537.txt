quantum entanglement can be used to demonstrate nonlocality and to teleport a quantum state from one place to another . the fact that entanglement can be used to do both these things has led people to believe that teleportation is a nonlocal effect . in this paper it is shown that teleportation is conceptually independent of nonlocality . this is done by constructing a toy local theory in which cloning is not possible ( without a no - cloning theory teleportation makes limited sense ) but teleportation is . teleportation in this local theory is achieved in an analogous way to the way it is done with quantum theory . this work provides some insight into what type of process teleportation is .
