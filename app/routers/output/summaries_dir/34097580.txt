strongly driving a two - level quantum system with light leads to a ladder of floquet states separated by the photon energy . nanoscale quantum devices allow the interplay of confined electrons , phonons , and photons to be studied under strong driving conditions . here we show that a single electron in a periodically driven dqd functions as a"floquet gain medium,"where population imbalances in the dqd floquet quasi - energy levels lead to an intricate pattern of gain and loss features in the cavity response . we further measure a large intra - cavity photon number n_c in the absence of a cavity drive field , due to equilibration in the floquet picture . our device operates in the absence of a dc current -- one and the same electron is repeatedly driven to the excited state to generate population inversion . these results pave the way to future studies of non - classical light and thermalization of driven quantum systems .
