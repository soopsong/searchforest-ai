quantum random walks ( qrws ) are random processes in which the resulting probability density of the"walker"state , whose movement is governed by a"coin"state , is described in a non - classical manner . previously , q - plates have been used to demonstrate qrws with polarization and orbital angular momentum playing the role of coin and walker states , respectively . in this theoretical analysis , we show how stress - engineered optics can be used to develop new platforms for complex qrws through relative simple optical elements . our work opens up new paths to speed up classical - to - quantum transitions in robust photonic networks .
