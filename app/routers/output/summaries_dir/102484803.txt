quantum memory management is becoming a pressing problem , especially given the recent research effort to develop new and more complex quantum algorithms . the only existing automatic method for quantum states clean - up relies on the availability of many extra resources . in this work , we propose an automatic tool for quantum memory management . we show how this problem exactly matches the reversible pebbling game . based on that , we develop a sat - based algorithm that returns a valid clean - up strategy , taking the limitations of the quantum hardware into account . the developed tool empowers the designer with the flexibility required to explore the trade - off between memory resources and number of operations . we present three show - cases to prove the validity of our approach . first , we apply the algorithm to straight - line programs , widely used in cryptographic applications . second , we perform a comparison with the existing approach , showing an average improvement of 52.77 % . finally , we show the advantage of using the tool when synthesizing a quantum circuit on a constrained near - term quantum device .
