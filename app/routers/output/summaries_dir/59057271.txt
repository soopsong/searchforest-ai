the present paper describes the experimental implementation of a measuring technique employing a slowly moving , near resonant , optical standing wave in the context of trapped ions . it is used to measure several figures of merit that are important for quantum computation in ion traps and which are otherwise not easily obtainable . our technique is shown to offer high precision , and also in many cases using a much simpler setup than what is normally used . we demonstrate here measurements of i ) the distance between two crystalline ions , ii ) the lamb - dicke parameter , iii ) temperature of the ion crystal , and iv ) the interferometric stability of a raman setup . the exact distance between two ions , in units of standing wave periods , is very important for motional entangling gates , and our method offers a practical way of calibrating this distance in the typical lab situation .
