we study the entanglement structure of states dual to multiboundary wormhole geometries using tensor network models . perfect and random tensor networks tiling the hyperbolic plane have been shown to provide good models of the entanglement structure in holography . we extend this by quotienting the plane by discrete isometries to obtain models of the multiboundary states . we show that there are networks where the entanglement structure is purely bipartite , extending results obtained in the large temperature limit . we analyse the entanglement structure in a range of examples .
