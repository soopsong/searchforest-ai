we present a method by which the degree of longitudinal variation in photonic crystal fibre ( pcf ) may be characterised through seeded four - wave mixing ( fwm ) . using an iterative numerical reconstruction , we created a model pcf that displays similar fwm phasematching properties across all measured length scales . our results demonstrate that the structure of our pcf varies by less than 1 % and that the characteristic length of the variations is approximately 15 cm .
