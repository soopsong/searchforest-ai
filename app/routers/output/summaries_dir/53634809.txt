compared to fiber continuous - variable quantum key distribution ( cvqkd ) , atmospheric link offers the possibility of a broader geographical coverage and more flexible transmission.however , there are many negative features of the atmospheric channel that will reduce the achievable secret key rate , such as beam extinction and a variety of turbulence effects . here we show how these factors affect performance of cvqkd , by considering our newly derived key rate formulas for fading channels , which involves detection imperfections , thus form a transmission model for cvqkd . this model can help evaluate the feasibility of experiment scheme in practical applications.we found that performance deterioration of horizontal link within the boundary layer is primarily caused by transmittance fluctuations ( including beam wandering , broadening , deformation , and scintillation),while transmittance change due to pulse broadening under weak turbulence is negligible . besides , we also found that communication interruptions can also cause a perceptible key rate reduction when the transmission distance is longer , while phase excess noise due to arrival time fluctuations requires new compensation techniques to reduce it to a negligible level . furthermore , it is found that performing homodyne detection enables longer transmission distances , whereas heterodyne allows higher achievable key rate over short distances .
