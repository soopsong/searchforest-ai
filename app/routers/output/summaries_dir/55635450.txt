quantum walks , whose dynamics is prescribed by alternating unitary coin and shift operators , possess topological phases akin to those of floquet topological insulators , driven by a time - periodic field . while there is ample theoretical work on topological phases of quantum walks where the coin operators are spin rotations , in experiments a different coin , the hadamard operator is often used instead . this was the case in a recent photonic quantum walk experiment , where protected edge states were observed between two bulks whose topological invariants , as calculated by the standard theory , were the same . this hints at a hidden topological invariant in the hadamard quantum walk . we establish a relation between the hadamard and the spin rotation operator , which allows us to apply the recently developed theory of topological phases of quantum walks to the one - dimensional hadamard quantum walk . the topological invariants we derive account for the edge state observed in the experiment , we thus reveal the hidden topological invariant of the one - dimensional hadamard quantum walk .
