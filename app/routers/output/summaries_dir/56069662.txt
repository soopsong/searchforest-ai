chip - based cavity optomechanical systems are being considered for applications in sensing , metrology , and quantum information science . critical to their development is an understanding of how the optical and mechanical modes interact , quantified by the coupling rate $ g_{0}$. here , we develop gaas optomechanical resonators and investigate the moving dielectric boundary and photoelastic contributions to $ g_{0}$. first , we consider coupling between the fundamental radial breathing mechanical mode and a 1550 nm band optical whispering gallery mode in microdisks . for decreasing disk radius from $ r=5 $ $ \mu$m to $ r=1 $ $ \mu$m , simulations and measurements show that $ g_{0}$ changes from being dominated by the moving boundary contribution to having an equal photoelastic contribution . next , we design and demonstrate nanobeam optomechanical crystals in which a $ 2.5 $ ghz mechanical breathing mode couples to a 1550 nm optical mode predominantly through the photoelastic effect . we show a significant ( 30 $ \%$ ) dependence of $ g_{0}$ on the device 's in - plane orientation , resulting from the difference in gaas photoelastic coefficients along different crystalline axes , with fabricated devices exhibiting $ g_{\text{0}}/2\pi$ as high as 1.1 mhz for orientation along the [ 110 ] axis . gaas nanobeam optomechanical crystals are a promising system which can combine the demonstrated large optomechanical coupling strength with additional functionality , such as piezoelectric actuation and incorporation of optical gain media .
