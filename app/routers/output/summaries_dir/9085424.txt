using results from quantum filtering theory and methods from classical control theory , we derive an optimal control strategy for an open two - level system ( a qubit in interaction with the electromagnetic field ) controlled by a laser . the aim is to optimally choose the laser 's amplitude and phase in order to drive the system into a desired state . the bellman equations are obtained for the case of diffusive and counting measurements for vacuum field states . a full exact solution of the optimal control problem is given for a system with simpler , linear , dynamics . these linear dynamics can be obtained physically by considering a two - level atom in a strongly driven , heavily damped , optical cavity .
