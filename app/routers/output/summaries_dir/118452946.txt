in this paper , we study the fast and noise - resistant population transfer , quantum entangled states preparation , and quantum entangled states ' transition by constructing the shortcuts to adiabatic passage ( stap ) for multiparticle based on the approach of"lewis - riesenfeld invariants"in distant cavity quantum electronic dynamics ( qed ) system . numerical simulation demonstrates that all of the schemes are fast and robust against the decoherence caused by atomic spontaneous emission and photon leakage . moreover , not only the total operation time but also the robustness in each scheme against decoherence is irrelevant to the number of qubits . this might lead to a useful step toward realizing the fast and noise - resistant quantum information processing in current technology .
