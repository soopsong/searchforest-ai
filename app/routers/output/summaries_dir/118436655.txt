the microcanonical entropy s(e , m ) as a function of the energy e and the magnetization m is computed analytically for the anisotropic quantum heisenberg model with curie - weiss - type interactions . the result shows a number of interesting properties which are peculiar to long - range interacting systems , including nonequivalence of ensembles and partial equivalence . furthermore , from the shape of the entropy it follows that the curie - weiss heisenberg model is indistinguishable from the curie - weiss ising model in canonical thermodynamics , although their microcanonical thermodynamics in general differs . the possibility of experimentally realizing quantum spin models with long - range interactions in a microcanonical setting by means of cold dipolar gases in optical lattices is discussed .
