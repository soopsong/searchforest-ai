in the present paper the cross norm criterion for separability of density matrices is studied . in the first part of the paper we determine the value of the greatest cross norm for werner states , for isotropic states and for bell diagonal states . in the second part we show that the greatest cross norm criterion induces a novel computable separability criterion for bipartite systems . this new criterion is a necessary but in general not a sufficient criterion for separability . it is shown , however , that for all pure states , for bell diagonal states , for werner states in dimension d=2 and for isotropic states in arbitrary dimensions the new criterion is necessary and sufficient . moreover , it is shown that for werner states in higher dimensions ( d greater than 2 ) , the new criterion is only necessary .
