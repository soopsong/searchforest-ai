phase retrieval and phaseless reconstruction for hilbert space frames is a very active area of research . recently , it was shown that these concepts are equivalent . in this paper , we make a detailed study of a weakening of these concepts to weak phase retrieval and weak phaseless reconstruction . we will give several necessary and/or sufficient conditions for frames to have these weak properties . we will prove three surprising results : ( 1 ) weak phaseless reconstruction is equivalent to phaseless reconstruction . i.e. it never was"weak " ; ( 2 ) weak phase retrieval is not equivalent to weak phaseless reconstruction ; ( 3 ) weak phase retrieval requires at least $ 2m-2 $ vectors in an m - dimensional hilbert space . we also gives several examples illustrating the relationship between these concepts .
