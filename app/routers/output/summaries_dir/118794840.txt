the theory of quantum jump trajectories provides a new framework for understanding dynamical phase transitions in open systems . a candidate for such transitions is the atom maser , which for certain parameters exhibits strong intermittency in the atom detection counts , and has a bistable stationary state . although previous numerical results suggested that the"free energy"may not be a smooth function , we show that the atom detection counts satisfy a large deviations principle , and therefore we deal with a phase cross - over rather than a genuine phase transition . we argue however that the latter occurs in the limit of infinite pumping rate . as a corollary , we obtain the central limit theorem for the counting process . the proof relies on the analysis of a certain deformed generator whose spectral bound is the limiting cumulant generating function . the latter is shown to be smooth , so that a large deviations principle holds by the gartner - ellis theorem . one of the main ingredients is the krein - rutman theorem which extends the perron - frobenius theory to a general class of positive compact semigroups .
