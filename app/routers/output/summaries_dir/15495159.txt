we consider the problem of controlling the spatiotemporal probability distribution of a robotic swarm that evolves according to a reflected diffusion process , using the space- and time - dependent drift vector field parameter as the control variable . in contrast to previous work on control of the fokker - planck equation , a zero - flux boundary condition is imposed on the partial differential equation that governs the swarm probability distribution , and only bounded vector fields are considered to be admissible as control parameters . under these constraints , we show that any initial probability distribution can be transported to a target probability distribution under certain assumptions on the regularity of the target distribution . in particular , we show that if the target distribution is ( essentially ) bounded , has bounded first - order and second - order partial derivatives , and is bounded from below by a strictly positive constant , then this distribution can be reached exactly using a drift vector field that is bounded in space and time . our proof is constructive and based on classical linear semigroup theoretic concepts .
