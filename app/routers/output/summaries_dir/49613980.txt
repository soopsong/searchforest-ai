we develop a new approach for solving stochastic quantum master equations with mixed initial states . first , we obtain that the solution of the jump - diffusion stochastic master equation is represented by a mixture of pure states satisfying a system of stochastic differential equations of schr\"odinger type . then , we design three exponential schemes for these coupled stochastic schr\"odinger equations , which are driven by brownian motions and jump processes . hence , we have constructed efficient numerical methods for the stochastic master equations based on quantum trajectories . the good performance of the new numerical integrators is illustrated by simulations of two quantum measurement processes .
