we consider a generic optomechanical system , consisting of a driven optical cavity and a movable mirror attached to a cantilever . systems of this kind ( and analogues ) have been realized in many recent experiments . it is well known that those systems can exhibit an instability towards a regime where the cantilever settles into self - sustained oscillations . in this paper , we briefly review the classical theory of the optomechanical instability , and then discuss the features arising in the quantum regime . we solve numerically a full quantum master equation for the coupled system , and use it to analyze the photon number , the cantilever 's mechanical energy , the phonon probability distribution and the mechanical wigner density , as a function of experimentally accessible control parameters . we observe and discuss the quantum - to - classical transition as a function of a suitable dimensionless quantum parameter .
