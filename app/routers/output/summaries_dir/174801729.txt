in quantum control , the robustness with respect to uncertainties in the system 's parameters or driving field characteristics is of paramount importance and has been studied theoretically , numerically and experimentally . we test in this paper stochastic search procedures ( stochastic gradient descent and the adam algorithm ) that sample , at each iteration , from the distribution of the parameter uncertainty , as opposed to previous approaches that use a fixed grid . we show that both algorithms behave well with respect to benchmarks and discuss their relative merits . in addition the methodology allows to address high dimensional parameter uncertainty ; we implement numerically , with good results , a 3d and a 6d case .
