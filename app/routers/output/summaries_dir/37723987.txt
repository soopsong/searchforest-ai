the concatenated greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( c - ghz ) state is a new type of multipartite entangled state , which has potential application in future quantum information . in this paper , we propose a protocol of constructing arbitrary c - ghz entangled state approximatively . different from the previous protocols , each logic is encoded in the coherent state . this protocol is based on the linear optics , which is feasible in experimental technology . this protocol may be useful in quantum information based on the c - ghz state .
