recently , a coherent picture of the quantum mechanics of an evaporating black hole has been presented which reconciles unitarity with the predictions of the equivalence principle . the thermal nature of a black hole as viewed in a distance reference frame arises from entanglement between the hard and soft modes , generated by the chaotic dynamics at the string scale . in this paper , we elaborate on this picture , particularly emphasizing the importance of the chaotic nature of the string ( uv ) dynamics across all low energy species in generating large ( ir ) spacetime behind the horizon . implications of this uv / ir relation include o(1 ) breaking of global symmetries at the string scale and a self - repair mechanism of black holes restoring the smoothness of their horizons . we also generalize the framework to other systems , including rindler , de sitter , and asymptotically flat spacetimes , and find a consistent picture in each case . finally , we discuss the origin of the particular construction adopted in describing the black hole interior as well as the outside of a de sitter horizon . we argue that the construction is selected by the quantum - to - classical transition , in particular the applicability of the born rule in a quantum mechanical world .
