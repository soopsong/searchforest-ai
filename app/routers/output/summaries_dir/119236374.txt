to acquire the best path - entangled photon fock states for robust quantum optical metrology with parity detection , we calculate phase information from a lossy interferometer by using twin entangled fock states . we show that ( a ) when loss is less than 50 % twin entangled fock states with large photon number difference give higher visibility while when loss is higher than 50 % the ones with less photon number difference give higher visibility ; ( b ) twin entangled fock states with large photon number difference give sub - shot - noise limit sensitivity for phase detection in a lossy environment . this result provides a reference on what particular path - entangled fock states are useful for real world metrology applications .
