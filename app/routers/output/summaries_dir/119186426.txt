we investigate the transport properties of two photons inside a one - dimensional waveguide side - coupled to a single - mode nonlinear cavity . the cavity is filled with a nonlinear kerr medium . based on the laplace transform method , we present analytic solution of quantum states of the transmitted and reflected two photons , which are initially prepared in a lorentzian wave packet . the solution reveals how quantum correlation between the two photons emerge after the scattering by the nonlinear cavity . in particular , we show that the output wave function of the two photons in position space can be localized in the relative coordinates , which is a feature that may be interpreted as a two - photon bound state in this waveguide - cavity system .
