hidden markov models are widely used in classical computer science to model stochastic processes with a wide range of applications . this paper concerns the quantum analogues of these machines --- so - called hidden quantum markov models ( hqmms ) . using the properties of quantum physics , hqmms are able to generate more complex random output sequences than their classical counterparts , even when using the same number of internal states . they are therefore expected to find applications as quantum simulators of stochastic processes . here , we emphasise that open quantum systems with instantaneous feedback are examples of hqmms , thereby identifying a novel application of quantum feedback control .
