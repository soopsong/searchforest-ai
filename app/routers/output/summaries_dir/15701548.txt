this article continues a prior investigation of the authors with the goal of extending characterization results of convolutional tight frames from the context of cyclic groups to general finite abelian groups . the collections studied are formed by translating a number of \emph{generators } by elements of a fixed subgroup and it is shown , under certain norm conditions , that tight frames with this structure are characterized as local minimizers of the frame potential . natural analogs to the downsampling and upsampling operators of finite cyclic groups are studied for arbitrary subgroups of finite abelian groups . directions of further study are also proposed .
