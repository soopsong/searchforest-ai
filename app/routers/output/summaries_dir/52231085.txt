we study the generation of majorana fermions in a two - dimensional topological superconductor placed in a transverse magnetic field b. a topological insulator / superconductor heterostructure and a two - dimensional p - wave superconductor are discussed . it is demonstrated that in these systems a single vortex creates two majorana fermions , one hosted at the vortex core . the wave function of the second majorana state is localized in the superconductor volume along a circle of radius $ r^ * \propto b^{-1}$ centered at the vortex core . in the case of many vortices , the sensitivity of $ r^*$ to the magnetic field b may be used to control the coupling between the majorana fermions . the latter property could be an asset for quantum computations .
