we investigate the action of the first three levels of the clifford hierarchy on sets of mutually unbiased bases comprising the ivanovic mub and the alltop mubs . vectors in the alltop mubs exhibit additional symmetries when the dimension is a prime number equal to 1 modulo 3 and thus the set of all alltop vectors splits into three clifford orbits . these vectors form configurations with so - called zauner subspaces , eigenspaces of order 3 elements of the clifford group highly relevant to the sic problem . we identify alltop vectors as the magic states that appear in the context of fault - tolerant universal quantum computing , wherein the appearance of distinct clifford orbits implies a surprising inequivalence between some magic states .
