characterizing and understanding noise affecting quantum states has immense benefits in spectroscopy as well as in realizing quantum devices . transverse relaxation times under a set of dynamical decoupling ( dd ) sequences with varying interpulse delays were earlier used for obtaining the noise spectral densities of single - qubit coherences . in this work , using a pair of homonuclear spins and nmr techniques , we experimentally characterize noise in certain decoherence - free subspaces . we also explore the noise of similar states in a heteronuclear spin pair . further , using a 10-qubit system , we investigate noise profiles of various multiqubit coherences and study the scaling of noise with respect to the coherence order . finally , using the experimentally obtained noise spectrum of the 10-qubit noon state , we predict the performance of a uhrig dd sequence and verify it experimentally .
