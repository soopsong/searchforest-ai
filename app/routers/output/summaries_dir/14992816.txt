recent theoretical and experimental investigations of coherent feedback control , the feedback control of a quantum system with another quantum system , has raised the important problem of how to synthesize a class of quantum systems , called the class of linear quantum stochastic systems , from basic quantum optical components and devices in a systematic way . the synthesis theory sought in this case can be naturally viewed as a quantum analogue of linear electrical network synthesis theory and as such has potential for applications beyond the realization of coherent feedback controllers . in earlier work , nurdin , james and doherty have established that an arbitrary linear quantum stochastic system can be realized as a cascade connection of simpler one degree of freedom quantum harmonic oscillators , together with a direct interaction hamiltonian which is bilinear in the canonical operators of the oscillators . however , from an experimental perspective and based on current methods and technologies , direct interaction hamiltonians are challenging to implement for systems with more than just a few degrees of freedom . in order to facilitate more tractable physical realizations of these systems , this paper develops a new synthesis algorithm for linear quantum stochastic systems that relies solely on field - mediated interactions , including in implementation of the direct interaction hamiltonian . explicit synthesis examples are provided to illustrate the realization of two degrees of freedom linear quantum stochastic systems using the new algorithm .
