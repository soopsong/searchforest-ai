in this work we study a newtonian cosmological model in the context of a noncommutative space . we show that the trajectories of test particles undergo modifications by considering a simplectic structure with a noncommutative parameter , \theta , in the coordinates . in the case of a positive cosmological constant , we obtain trajectories which develop spirals and we also find a correction to the hubble constant . we finally show that in the strong \theta limit , there is a relation with a godel - type metric .
