we propose efficient schemes for converting three - photon , four - photon and five - photon ghz state to a $ w$ state or dicke state , respectively with the nitrogen - vacancy ( n - v ) centers via single - photon input - output process and cross - kerr nonlinearities . the total success probability can be improved by iterating the conversion process for the case of three - photon and five - photon while it does not require iteration for converting four - photon ghz state to a $ w$ state . the analysis of feasibility shows that our scheme is feasible for current experimental technology .
