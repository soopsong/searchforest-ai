we present a quantum communication experiment conducted over a point - to - point free - space link of 1.6 km in urban conditions . we study atmospheric influences on the capability of the link to act as a continuous - variable ( cv ) quantum channel . continuous polarization states ( that contain the signal encoding as well as a local oscillator in the same spatial mode ) are prepared and sent over the link in a polarization multiplexed setting . both signal and local oscillator undergo the same atmospheric fluctuations . these are intrinsically auto - compensated which removes detrimental influences on the interferometric visibility . at the receiver , we measure the q - function and interpret the data using the framework of effective entanglement . we compare different state amplitudes and alphabets ( two - state and four - state ) and determine their optimal working points with respect to the distributed effective entanglement . based on the high entanglement transmission rates achieved , our system indicates the high potential of atmospheric links in the field of cv qkd .
