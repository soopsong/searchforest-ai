photonic crystal nanobeam cavities are versatile platforms of interest for optical communications , optomechanics , optofluidics , cavity qed , etc . in a previous work \cite{quan10 } , we proposed a deterministic method to achieve ultrahigh \emph{q } cavities . this follow - up work provides systematic analysis and verifications of the deterministic design recipe and further extends the discussion to air - mode cavities . we demonstrate designs of dielectric - mode and air - mode cavities with $ q>10 ^ 9 $ , as well as cavities with both high-\emph{q } ( $ > 10 ^ 7 $ ) and high on - resonance transmissions ( $ t>95%$ ) .
