multipartite entanglement and nonclassicality of four - mode gaussian states generated in two simultaneous nonlinear processes involving parametric down - conversion and frequency up - conversion are analyzed assuming the vacuum as the initial state . suitable conditions for the generation of highly entangled states are found . transfer of the entanglement from the down - converted modes into the up - converted ones is also suggested . the analysis of the whole set of states reveals that sub - shot - noise intensity correlations between the equally - populated down - converted modes , as well as the equally - populated up - converted modes , uniquely identify entangled states . they represent a powerful entanglement identifier also in other cases with arbitrarily populated modes .
