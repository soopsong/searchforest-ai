we show that in device independent quantum key distribution protocols the privacy of randomness is of crucial importance . for sublinear test sample sizes even the slightest guessing probability by an eavesdropper will completely compromise security . we show that a combined attack exploiting test sample and measurement choices compromises the security even with a linear size test sample and otherwise device independent security considerations . we explicitly derive the sample size needed to retrieve security as a function of the randomness quality . we demonstrate that exploiting features of genuinely higher dimensional systems one can reduce this weakness and provide device independent security more robust against weak randomness sources .
