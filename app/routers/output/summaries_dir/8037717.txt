physical implementations of qubits can be extremely sensitive to environmental coupling , which can result in decoherence . while efforts are made for protection , coupling to the environment is necessary to measure and manipulate the state of the qubit . as such , the goal of having long qubit energy relaxation times is in competition with that of achieving high - fidelity qubit control and measurement . here we propose a method that integrates filtering techniques for preserving superconducting qubit lifetimes together with the dispersive coupling of the qubit to a microwave resonator for control and measurement . the result is a compact circuit that protects qubits from spontaneous loss to the environment , while also retaining the ability to perform fast , high - fidelity readout . importantly , we show the device operates in a regime that is attainable with current experimental parameters and provide a specific example for superconducting qubits in circuit quantum electrodynamics .
