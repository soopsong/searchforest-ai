we consider the manipulation of multipartite entangled states in the limit of many copies under quantum operations that asymptotically can not generate entanglement . as announced in [ brandao and plenio , nature physics 4 , 8 ( 2008 ) ] , and in stark contrast to the manipulation of entanglement under local operations and classical communication , the entanglement shared by two or more parties can be reversibly interconverted in this setting . the unique entanglement measure is identified as the regularized relative entropy of entanglement , which is shown to be equal to a regularized and smoothed version of the logarithmic robustness of entanglement . here we give a rigorous proof of this result , which is fundamentally based on a certain recent extension of quantum stein 's lemma proved in [ brandao and plenio , commun . math . 295 , 791 ( 2010 ) ] , giving the best measurement strategy for discriminating several copies of an entangled state from an arbitrary sequence of non - entangled states , with an optimal distinguishability rate equal to the regularized relative entropy of entanglement . we moreover analyse the connection of our approach to axiomatic formulations of the second law of thermodynamics .
