we develop a general theoretical framework of semiclassical phase reduction for analyzing synchronization of quantum limit - cycle oscillators . the dynamics of quantum dissipative systems exhibiting limit - cycle oscillations are reduced to a simple , one - dimensional classical stochastic differential equation approximately describing the phase dynamics of the system under the semiclassical approximation . the density matrix and power spectrum of the original quantum system can be approximately reconstructed from the reduced phase equation . the developed framework enables us to analyze synchronization dynamics of quantum limit - cycle oscillators using the standard methods for classical limit - cycle oscillators in a quantitative way . as an example , we analyze synchronization of a quantum van der pol oscillator under harmonic driving and squeezing , including the case that the squeezing is strong and the oscillation is asymmetric . the developed framework provides insights into the relation between quantum and classical synchronization and will facilitate systematic analysis and control of quantum nonlinear oscillators .
