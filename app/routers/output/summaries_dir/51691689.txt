higher - order transitions can occur in the ultrastrong - coupling regime of circuit qed through virtual processes governed by the counter - rotating interactions . we propose a feasible way to probe higher - order transitions through the scattering of propagating microwave photons incident on the hybrid qubit - cavity system . the lineshapes in the scattering spectra can indicate the coherent interaction between the qubits and the cavity , and the higher - order transitions can be identified in the population spectra . we further find that if the coupling strengths between the two qubits and the cavity are tuned to be asymmetric , the dark antisymmetric state with the fano - lineshape can also be detected from the variations in the scattering spectra .
