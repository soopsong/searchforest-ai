we discuss prospects of building hybrid quantum devices involving elements of atomic and molecular physics , quantum optics and solid state elements with the attempt to combine advantages of the respective systems in compatible experimental setups . in particular , we summarize our recent work on quantum hybrid devices and briefly discuss recent ideas for quantum networks . these include interfacing of molecular quantum memory with circuit qed , and using nanomechanical elements strongly coupled to qubits represented by electronic spins , as well as single atoms or atomic ensembles .
