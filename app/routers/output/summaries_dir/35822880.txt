we present a method for obtaining evolution operators for linear quantum trajectories . we apply this to a number of physical examples of varying mathematical complexity , in which the quantum trajectories describe the continuous projection measurement of physical observables . using this method we calculate the average conditional uncertainty for the measured observables , being a central quantity of interest in these measurement processes .
