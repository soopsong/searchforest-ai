we characterize photonic transport in a boundary driven array of nonlinear optical cavities . we find that the output field suddenly drops when the chain length is increased beyond a threshold . after this threshold a highly chaotic and unstable regime emerges , which marks the onset of a super - diffusive photonic transport . we show the scaling of the threshold with pump intensity and nonlinearity . finally , we address the competition of disorder and nonlinearity presenting a diffusive - insulator phase transition .
