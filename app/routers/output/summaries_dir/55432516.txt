in a multipartite scenario quantum entanglement manifests its most dramatic form when the state is genuinely entangled . it is , therefore , of significant operational interest to identify subspaces of multipartite quantum systems that contain such states only . in this work , we introduce the notion of unextendible biseparable bases ( ubb ) that provides an adequate method to construct such genuinely entangled subspaces ( ges ) . we provide explicit construction of two types of ubbs -- party symmetric and party asymmetric -- for every 3-qudit quantum system , with local dimension $ d\ge 3$. further we show that the ges resulting from the symmetric construction is indeed a bidistillable subspace , i.e. , all the states supported on it contain free ( distillable ) entanglement across every bipartition .
