i assess the potential of quantum computation . broad and important applications must be found to justify construction of a quantum computer ; i review some of the known quantum algorithms and consider the prospects for finding new ones . quantum computers are notoriously susceptible to making errors ; i discuss recently developed fault – tolerant procedures that enable a quantum computer with noisy gates to perform reliably . quantum computing hardware is still in its infancy ; i comment on the specifications that should be met by future hardware . over the past few years , work on quantum computation has erected a new classification of computational complexity , has generated profound insights into the nature of decoherence , and has stimulated the formulation of new techniques in high – precision experimental physics . a broad interdisciplinary effort will be needed if quantum computers are to fulfil their destiny as the world 's fastest computing devices . this paper is an expanded version of remarks that were prepared for a panel discussion at the itp conference on quantum coherence and decoherence , december 1996 .
