we present a study on how to realize the widely interested optomechanical entanglement at high temperature . unlike the majority of the previous experimental and theoretical researches that consider the entanglement of a mechanical resonator with a cavity field created by red - detuned continuous - wave or blue - detuned pulsed driving field , we find that applying blue - detuned continuous - wave pump field to cavity optomechanical systems can achieve considerable degrees of quantum entanglement , which is generally challenging to obtain at high temperature for the known physical systems . the competition between the induced squeezing - type interaction and the existing decoherence leads to stable entanglement in dynamically unstable regime . there is a much more relaxed condition for the existence of entanglement , as compared with the well - known criterion for neglecting the thermal decoherence on optomechanically coupled systems . a simple relation about a boundary in the parameter space , across which the entanglement can exist or not , is found with an analytical expression for the degree of the achieved entanglement at any temperature , which is derived for the systems of highly resolved sideband . the studied scenario with blue - detuned continuous - wave driving field can greatly simplify the generation of the widely interested optomechanical entanglement of macroscopic quantum states . our study also provides the answers to two fundamentally meaningful open problems : ( 1 ) what is the condition for a system to avoid its loss of quantum entanglement under thermal decoherence ? ( 2 ) is it possible to preserve the entanglement in a thermal environment by increasing the interaction that entangles the subsystems ?
