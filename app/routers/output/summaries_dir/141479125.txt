we introduce a binary temperature classifier quantum model operates in a thermal environment . proper measurement and sensing of temperature are of central importance to the realization of nanoscale quantum devices . more significantly , minimal classifiers may constitute the basic units for the physical quantum neural networks . in the present study , first , the mathematical model was introduced through a two - level quantum system weakly coupled to the thermal reservoirs and demonstrate that the model faithfully classifies the temperature information of the reservoirs in the thermal steady state limit . we also suggest a physical model implements the proposed thermal classifier by superconducting circuits composed of transmon qubits and discuss the feasibility by realistic parameters . it 's shown that the physical model operates three orders of magnitude faster than the current binary classifiers .
