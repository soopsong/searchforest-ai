we design fast protocols to separate or recombine two ions in a segmented paul trap . by inverse engineering the time evolution of the trapping potential composed of a harmonic and a quartic term , it is possible to perform these processes in a few microseconds without final excitation . these times are much shorter than the ones reported so far experimentally . the design is based on dynamical invariants and dynamical normal modes . anharmonicities beyond the harmonic approximation at potential minima are taken into account perturbatively . the stability versus an unknown potential bias is also studied .
