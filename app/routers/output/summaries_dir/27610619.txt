quantum critical points are characterized by scale invariant correlations and correspondingly long ranged entanglement . as such , they present fascinating examples of quantum states of matter , the study of which has been an important theme in modern physics . nevertheless very little is known about the fate of quantum criticality under non equilibrium conditions . in this paper we investigate the effect of external noise sources on quantum critical points . it is natural to expect that noise will have a similar effect to finite temperature , destroying the subtle correlations underlying the quantum critical behavior . surprisingly we find that in many interesting situations the ubiquitous 1 / f noise preserves the critical correlations . the emergent states show intriguing interplay of intrinsic quantum critical and external noise driven fluctuations . we demonstrate this general phenomenon with specific examples in solid state and ultracold atomic systems . moreover our approach shows that genuine quantum phase transitions can exist even under non equilibrium conditions .
