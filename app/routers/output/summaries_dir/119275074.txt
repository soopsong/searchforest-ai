we extend the former matrix rearrangement approach of the entangling power to the general cases , without the requirement of the same dimensions of the subsystems . the entangling power of a unitary operator is completely determined by its realignment and partial transposition . as applications , we calculate the entangling power for the ising interaction and the isotropic heisenberg interaction in the mixed qudit system .
