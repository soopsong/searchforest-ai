several recent theories suggest that light moduli or particles in"large"extra dimensions could mediate macroscopic forces exceeding gravitational strength at length scales below a millimeter . such new forces can be parameterized as a yukawa - type correction to the newtonian potential of strength $ \alpha$ relative to gravity and range $ \lambda$. to extend the search for such new physics we have improved our apparatus utilizing cryogenic micro - cantilevers capable of measuring attonewton forces , which now includes a switchable magnetic force for calibration . our most recent experimental constraints on yukawa - type deviations from newtonian gravity are more than three times as stringent as our previously published results , and represent the best bound in the range of 5 - 15 microns , with a 95 percent confidence exclusion of forces with $ |\alpha|>14,000 $ at $ \lambda$ = 10 microns .
