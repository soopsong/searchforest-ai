we study the transport properties of a single photon scattered by a two - level system ( tls ) in a t - shaped waveguide , which is made of two coupled - resonator waveguides ( crws)--- an infinite crw and a semi - infinite crw . the spontaneous emission of the tls directs single photons from one crw to the other . although the transfer rate is different for the wave incident from different crws , due to the boundary breaking the translational symmetry , the boundary can enhance the transfer rate found in phys . rev . lett . 111 , 103604 ( 2013 ) and phys . rev . a 89 , 013805 ( 2014 ) , as the transfer rate could be unity for the wave incident from the semi - infinite crw .
