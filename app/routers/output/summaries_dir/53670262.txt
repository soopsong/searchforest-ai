window functions are widely employed in memristor models to restrict the changes of the internal state variables to specified intervals . here we show that the actual choice of window function is of significant importance for the predictive modelling of memristors . using a recently formulated theory of memristor attractors , we demonstrate that whether stable fixed points exist depends on the type of window function used in the model . our main findings are formulated in terms of two memristor attractor theorems , which apply to broad classes of memristor models . as an example of our findings , we predict the existence of stable fixed points in biolek window function memristors and their absence in memristors described by the joglekar window function , when such memristors are driven by periodic alternating polarity pulses . it is anticipated that the results of this study will contribute toward the development of more sophisticated models of memristive devices and systems .
