in this letter , we present a detailed , all optical study of the influence of different excitation schemes on the indistinguishability of single photons from a single inas quantum dot . for this study , we measure the hong - ou - mandel interference of consecutive photons from the spontaneous emission of an inas quantum dot state under various excitation schemes and different excitation conditions and give a comparison .
