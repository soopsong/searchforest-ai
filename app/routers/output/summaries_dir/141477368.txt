the dissipative properties of an optical cavity can be effectively controlled by placing it in a feedback loop where the light at the cavity output is detected and the corresponding signal is used to modulate the amplitude of a laser field which drives the cavity itself . here we show that this effect can be exploited to improve the performance of an optomechanical heat engine which makes use of polariton excitations as working fluid . in particular we demonstrate that , by employing a positive feedback close to the instability threshold , it is possible to operate this engine also under parameters regimes which are not usable without feedback , and which may significantly ease the practical implementation of this device .
