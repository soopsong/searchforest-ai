compact silicon integrated devices , such as micro - ring resonators , have recently been demonstrated as efficient sources of quantum correlated photon pairs . the mass production of integrated devices demands the implementation of fast and reliable techniques to monitor the device performances . in the case of time - energy correlations , this is particularly challenging , as it requires high spectral resolution that is not currently achievable in coincidence measurements . here we reconstruct the joint spectral density of photons pairs generated by spontaneous four - wave mixing in a silicon ring resonator by studying the corresponding stimulated process , namely stimulated four wave mixing . we show that this approach , featuring high spectral resolution and short measurement times , allows one to discriminate between nearly - uncorrelated and highly - correlated photon pairs .
