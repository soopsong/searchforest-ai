in this work , motivated by the sine - square deformation ( ssd ) for ( 1 + 1)-dimensional quantum critical systems , we study the non - equilibrium quantum dynamics of a conformal field theory ( cft ) with ssd , which was recently proposed to have continuous energy spectrum and continuous virasoro algebra . in particular , we study the time evolution of entanglement entropy after a quantum quench from a uniform cft , which is defined on a finite space of length $ l$ , to a sine - square deformed cft . we find there is a crossover time $ t^{\ast}$ that divides the entanglement evolution into two interesting regions . for $ t\ll t^{\ast}$ , the entanglement entropy does not evolve in time ; for $ t\gg t^{\ast}$ , the entanglement entropy grows as $ s_a(t)\simeq \frac{c}{3}\log t$ , which is independent of the lengths of the subsystem and the total system . this $ \log t$ growth with no revival indicates that a sine - square deformed cft effectively has an infinite length , in agreement with previous studies based on the energy spectrum analysis . furthermore , we study the quench dynamics for a cft with m$\ddot{\text{o}}$bius deformation , which interpolates between a uniform cft and a sine - square deformed cft . the entanglement entropy oscillates in time with period $ l_{\text{eff}}=l\cosh(2\theta)$ , with $ \theta=0 $ corresponding to the uniform case and $ \theta\to \infty$ corresponding to the ssd limit . our field theory calculation is confirmed by a numerical study on a ( 1 + 1)-d critical fermion chain .
