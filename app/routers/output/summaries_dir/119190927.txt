two level quantum system ( qubit ) and non - classical states of light such as single photon and superposition of coherent state are under special attention in quantum technologies such as quantum computing , quantum communication and quantum computers . so , behavior of two - level system driven by such inputs is important . in this paper , the behavior of two - level quantum system driven by vacuum state , single photon and superposition of coherent state was investigated by assuming pauli matrices as system operators in quantum filtering equations . the purity of conditioned and unconditioned state are also analyzed when the system is driven by different inputs . the results show that the stochastic master equation dynamic has more information about the status of system than master equation dynamic .
