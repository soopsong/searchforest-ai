we investigate the photon emission properties of the driven - dissipative rabi model in the so - called ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes , where the atom - cavity coupling rate $ g$ becomes comparable or larger than the cavity frequency $ \omega_c$. by solving numerically the master equation in the dressed - state basis , we compute the output field correlation functions in the steady - state for a wide range of coupling rates . we find that , as the atom - cavity coupling strength increases , the system undergoes multiple transitions in the photon statistics . in particular , a first sharp anti - bunching to bunching transition , occurring at $ g\sim0.45\omega_c$ , leading to the breakdown of the photon blockade due to the counter - rotating terms , is shown to be the consequence of a parity shift in the energy spectrum . a subsequent revival of the photon blockade and the emergence of the quasi - coherent statistics , for even larger coupling rates , are attributed to an interplay between the nonlinearity in the energy spectrum and the transition rates between the dressed states .
