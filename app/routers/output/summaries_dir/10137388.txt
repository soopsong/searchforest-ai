we demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of free space quantum key distribution with continuous variables under real atmospheric conditions . more specifically , we transmit coherent polarization states over a 100 m free space channel on the roof of our institute 's building . in our scheme , signal and local oscillator are combined in a single spatial mode which auto - compensates atmospheric fluctuations and results in an excellent interference . furthermore , the local oscillator acts as spatial and spectral filter thus allowing unrestrained daylight operation .
