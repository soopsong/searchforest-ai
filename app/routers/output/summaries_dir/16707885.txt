this note is intended to foster a discussion about the extent to which typical problems arising in quantum information theory are algorithmically decidable ( in principle rather than in practice ) . various problems in the context of entanglement theory and quantum channels turn out to be decidable via quantifier elimination as long as they admit a compact formulation without quantification over integers . for many asymptotically defined properties which have to hold for all or for one integer n , however , effective procedures seem to be difficult if not impossible to find . we review some of the main tools for ( dis)proving decidability and apply them to problems in quantum information theory . we find that questions like"can we overcome fidelity 1/2 w.r.t . a two - qubit singlet state?"easily become undecidable . a closer look at such questions might rule out some of the"single - letter"formulas sought in quantum information theory .
