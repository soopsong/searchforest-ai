waveguides in nonlinear materials are a key component for photon pair sources and offer promising solutions to interface quantum memories through frequency conversion . to bring these technologies closer to every - day life , it is still necessary to guarantee a reliable and efficient fabrication of these devices . therefore , a thorough understanding of the technological limitations of nonlinear waveguiding devices is paramount . in this paper , we study the link between fabrication errors of waveguides in nonlinear crystals and the final performance of such devices . in particular , we first derive a mathematical expression to qualitatively assess the technological limitations of any nonlinear waveguide . we apply this tool to study the impact of fabrication imperfections on the phasematching properties of different quantum processes realized in titanium - diffused lithium niobate waveguides . finally , we analyse the effect of waveguide imperfections on quantum state generation and manipulation for few selected cases . we find that the main source of phasematching degradation is the correlated variation of the waveguide 's dispersion properties and suggest different possible strategies to reduce the impact of fabrication imperfections .
