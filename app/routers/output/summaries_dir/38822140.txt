do diffusive non - markovian stochastic schr\"odinger equations ( sses ) for open quantum systems have a physical interpretation ? in a recent paper [ phys . rev . a 66 , 012108 ( 2002 ) ] we investigated this question using the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics . we found that the solution of a non - markovian sse represents the state the system would be in at that time if a measurement was performed on the environment at that time , and yielded a particular result . however , the linking of solutions at different times to make a trajectory is , we concluded , a fiction . in this paper we investigate this question using the modal ( hidden variable ) interpretation of quantum mechanics . we find that the noise function $ z(t)$ appearing in the non - markovian sse can be interpreted as a hidden variable for the environment . that is , some chosen property ( beable ) of the environment has a definite value $ z(t)$ even in the absence of measurement on the environment . the non - markovian sse gives the evolution of the state of the system ` ` conditioned ' ' on this environment hidden variable . we present the theory for diffusive non - markovian sses that have as their markovian limit sses corresponding to homodyne and heterodyne detection , as well as one which has no markovian limit .
