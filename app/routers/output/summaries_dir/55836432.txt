hybrid quantum systems can often be described in terms of polaritons . these are quasiparticles formed of superpositions of their constituents , with relative weights depending on some control parameter in their interaction . in many cases , these constituents are coupled to reservoirs at different temperatures . this suggests a general approach to the realization of polaritonic heat engines where a thermodynamic cycle is realized by tuning this control parameter . here we discuss what is arguably the simplest such engine , a single qubit coupled to a single photon . we show that this system can extract work from feeble thermal microwave fields . we also propose a quantum measurement scheme of the work and evaluate its back - action on the operation of the engine .
