we study the entanglement spectrum ( es ) and entropy between two coupled tomonaga - luttinger liquids ( tlls ) on parallel periodic chains . this problem gives access to the entanglement properties of various interesting systems , such as spin ladders as well as two - dimensional topological phases . by expanding interchain interactions to quadratic order in bosonic fields , we are able to calculate the es for both gapped and gapless systems using only methods for free theories . in certain gapless phases of coupled non - chiral tlls , we interestingly find an es with a dispersion relation proportional to the square root of the subsystem momentum , which we relate to a long - range interaction in the entanglement hamiltonian . we numerically demonstrate the emergence of this unusual dispersion in a model of hard - core bosons on a ladder . in gapped phases of coupled non - chiral tlls , which are relevant to spin ladders and topological insulators , we show that the es consists of linearly dispersing modes , which resembles the spectrum of a single - chain tll but is characterized by a modified tll parameter . based on a calculation for coupled chiral tlls , we are also able to provide a very simple proof for the correspondence between the es and the edge - state spectrum in quantum hall systems consistent with previous numerical and analytical studies .
