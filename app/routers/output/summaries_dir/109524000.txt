we demonstrate experimentally the feasibility of continuous variable quantum key distribution ( cv - qkd ) in dense - wavelength - division multiplexing networks ( dwdm ) , where qkd will typically have to coexist with several co- propagating ( forward or backward ) c - band classical channels whose launch power is around 0dbm . we have conducted experimental tests of the coexistence of cv - qkd multiplexed with an intense classical channel , for different input powers and different dwdm wavelengths . over a 25 km fiber , a cv - qkd operated over the 1530.12 nm channel can tolerate the noise arising from up to 11.5dbm classical channel at 1550.12 nm in forward direction ( 9.7dbm in backward ) . a positive key rate ( 0.49kb / s ) can be obtained at 75 km with classical channel power of respectively -3dbm and -9dbm in forward and backward . based on these measurements , we have also simulated the excess noise and optimized channel allocation for the integration of cv - qkd in some access networks . we have , for example , shown that cv - qkd could coexist with 5 pairs of channels ( with nominal input powers : 2dbm forward and 1dbm backward ) over a 25 km wdm - pon network . the obtained results demonstrate the outstanding capacity of cv - qkd to coexist with classical signals of realistic intensity in optical networks .
