we propose a method to simulate spin models in trapped ions using a digital - analog approach , consisting in a suitable gate decomposition in terms of analog blocks and digital steps . in this way , we show that the quantum dynamics of an enhanced variety of spin models could be implemented with substantially less number of gates than a fully digital approach . typically , analog blocks are built of multipartite dynamics providing the complexity of the simulated model , while the digital steps are local operations bringing versatility to it . finally , we describe a possible experimental implementation in trapped - ion technologies .
