phase - sensitive properties of light play a crucial role in a variety of quantum optical phenomena , which have been mostly discussed in the framework of photoelectric detection theory . however , modern detection schemes , such as arrays of on - off detectors , are not based on photoelectric counting . we demonstrate that the theory of homodyning with such click counting detectors can be established by using a proper detection model . for practical applications , a variety of typically occurring imperfections are rigorously analyzed and directly observable nonclassicality criteria are studied . fundamental examples demonstrate the general functionality of our technique . thus , our approach of homodyne detection with on - off detector systems is able to bridge the gap between imperfect detection and the phase resolution demands for modern applications of quantum light .
