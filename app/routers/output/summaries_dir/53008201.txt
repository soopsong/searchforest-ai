we introduce the probability distributions describing quantum observables in conventional quantum mechanics and clarify their relations to the tomographic probability distributions describing quantum states . we derive the evolution equation for quantum observables ( heisenberg equation ) in the probability representation and give examples of the spin-1/2 ( qubit ) states and the spin observables . we present quantum channels for qubits in the probability representation .
