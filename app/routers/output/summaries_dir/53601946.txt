a surprising feature of the kerr metric is the anisotropy of the speed of light . the angular momentum of a rotating massive object causes co- and counter - propagating light paths to move at faster and slower velocities , respectively as determined by a far - away clock . based on this effect we derive ultimate quantum limits for the measurement of the kerr rotation parameter $ a$ using a interferometric set up . as a possible implementation , we propose a mach - zehnder interferometer to measure the"one - way height differential"time effect . we isolate the effect by calibrating to a dark port and rotating the interferometer such that only the direction dependent kerr - metric induced phase term remains . we transform to the zero angular momentum observer ( zamo ) flat metric where the observer see $ c=1$. we use this metric and the lorentz transformations to calculate the same kerr phase shift . we then consider non - stationary observers moving with the planet 's rotation , and find a method for cancelling the additional phase from the classical relative motion , thus leaving only the curvature induced phase .
