we propose a quantum description of the cooling of a micromechanical flexural oscillator by a one - dimensional transmission line resonator via a force that resembles cavity radiation pressure . the mechanical oscillator is capacitively coupled to the central conductor of the transmission line resonator . at the optimal point , the micromechanical oscillator can be cooled close to the ground state , and the cooling can be measured by homodyne detection of the output microwave signal .
