quantum systems are invariably open , evolving under surrounding influences rather than in isolation . standard open quantum system methods eliminate all information on the environmental state to yield a tractable description of the system dynamics . by incorporating a collective coordinate of the environment into the system hamiltonian , we circumvent this limitation . our theory provides straightforward access to important environmental properties that would otherwise be obscured , allowing us to quantify the evolving system - environment correlations . as a direct result , we show that the generation of robust system - environment correlations that persist into equilibrium ( heralded also by the emergence of non - gaussian environmental states ) renders the canonical system steady - state almost always incorrect . the resulting equilibrium states deviate markedly from those predicted by standard perturbative techniques and are instead fully characterised by thermal states of the mapped system - collective coordinate hamiltonian . we outline how noncanonical system states could be investigated experimentally to study deviations from canonical thermodynamics , with direct relevance to molecular and solid - state nanosystems .
