we study the scaling properties of the ground - state entanglement between finite subsystems of infinite two - dimensional free lattice models , as measured by the logarithmic negativity . for adjacent regions with a common boundary , we observe that the negativity follows a strict area law for a lattice of harmonic oscillators , whereas for fermionic hopping models the numerical results indicate a multiplicative logarithmic correction . in this latter case , we conjecture a formula for the prefactor of the area - law violating term , which is entirely determined by the geometries of the fermi surface and the boundary between the subsystems . the conjecture is tested against numerical results and a good agreement is found .
