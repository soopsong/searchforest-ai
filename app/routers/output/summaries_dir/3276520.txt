global , secure quantum channels will require efficient distribution of entangled photons . long distance , low - loss interconnects can only be realized using photons as quantum information carriers . however , a quantum light source combining both high qubit fidelity and on - demand bright emission has proven elusive . here , we show a bright photonic nanostructure generating polarization - entangled photon - pairs that strongly violates bell 's inequality . a highly symmetric inasp quantum dot generating entangled photons is encapsulated in a tapered nanowire waveguide to ensure directional emission and efficient light extraction . we collect $ \sim$200 khz entangled photon - pairs at the first lens under 80\,mhz pulsed excitation , which is a 20 times enhancement as compared to a bare quantum dot without a photonic nanostructure . the performed bell test using the clauser - horne - shimony - holt inequality reveals a clear violation ( $ s_{\text{chsh}}>2 $ ) by up to 9.3 standard deviations . by using a novel quasi - resonant excitation scheme at the wurtzite inp nanowire resonance to reduce multi - photon emission , the entanglement fidelity ( $ f=0.817\,\pm\,0.002 $ ) is further enhanced without temporal post - selection , allowing for the violation of bell 's inequality in the rectilinear - circular basis by 25 standard deviations . our results on nanowire - based quantum light sources highlight their potential application in secure data communication utilizing measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution and quantum repeater protocols .
