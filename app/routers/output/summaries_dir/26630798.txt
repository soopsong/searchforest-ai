we address the validity of the single - mode approximation that is commonly invoked in the analysis of entanglement in non - inertial frames and in other relativistic quantum information scenarios . we show that the single - mode approximation is not valid for arbitrary states , finding corrections to previous studies beyond such approximation in the bosonic and fermionic cases . we also exhibit a class of wave packets for which the single - mode approximation is justified subject to the peaking constraints set by an appropriate fourier transform .
