a quantum system may suffer from local noises in experiment , and be disturbed partially or completely . in practice , sometimes the multipartite quantum system lose some parts due to local noises , and in this case it is interesting to know whether the residual system still carry information or not . robust quantum states have the ability to carry on information after the loss of some partites . in this paper , we study $ 2 \times n \times m$ class of quantum states and identify all robust and fragile states with respect to loss of qubit . we also show the robustness of the $ 2 \times n \times m$ robust quantum system after the loss of qubit .
