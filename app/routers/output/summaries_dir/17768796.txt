the key approaches for machine learning , especially learning in unknown probabilistic environments are new representations and computation mechanisms . in this paper , a novel quantum reinforcement learning ( qrl ) method is proposed by combining quantum theory and reinforcement learning ( rl ) . inspired by the state superposition principle and quantum parallelism , a framework of value updating algorithm is introduced . the state ( action ) in traditional rl is identified as the eigen state ( eigen action ) in qrl . the state ( action ) set can be represented with a quantum superposition state and the eigen state ( eigen action ) can be obtained by randomly observing the simulated quantum state according to the collapse postulate of quantum measurement . the probability of the eigen action is determined by the probability amplitude , which is parallelly updated according to rewards . some related characteristics of qrl such as convergence , optimality and balancing between exploration and exploitation are also analyzed , which shows that this approach makes a good tradeoff between exploration and exploitation using the probability amplitude and can speed up learning through the quantum parallelism . to evaluate the performance and practicability of qrl , several simulated experiments are given and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of qrl algorithm for some complex problems . the present work is also an effective exploration on the application of quantum computation to artificial intelligence .
