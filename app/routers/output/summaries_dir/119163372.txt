state mapping between atoms and photons , and photon - photon interactions play an important role in scalable quantum information processing . we consider the interaction of a two - level atom with a quantized \textit{propagating } pulse in free space and study the probability $ p_e(t)$ of finding the atom in the excited state at any time $ t$. this probability is expected to depend on ( i ) the quantum state of the pulse field and ( ii ) the overlap between the pulse and the dipole pattern of the atomic spontaneous emission . we show that the second effect is captured by a single parameter $ \lambda\in[0,8\pi/3]$ , obtained by weighting the dipole pattern with the numerical aperture . then $ p_e(t)$ can be obtained by solving time - dependent heisenberg - langevin equations . we provide detailed solutions for both single photon fock state and coherent states and for various temporal shapes of the pulses .
