in this work , we illustrate the recently introduced concept of the cavity born - oppenheimer approximation for correlated electron - nuclear - photon problems in detail . we demonstrate how an expansion in terms of conditional electronic and photon - nuclear wave functions accurately describes eigenstates of strongly correlated light - matter systems . for a gaas quantum ring model in resonance with a photon mode we highlight how the ground - state electronic potential - energy surface changes the usual harmonic potential of the free photon mode to a dressed mode with a double - well structure . this change is accompanied by a splitting of the electronic ground - state density . for a model where the photon mode is in resonance with a vibrational transition , we observe in the excited - state electronic potential - energy surface a splitting from a single minimum to a double minimum . furthermore , for a time - dependent setup , we show how the dynamics in correlated light - matter systems can be understood in terms of population transfer between potential energy surfaces . this work at the interface of quantum chemistry and quantum optics paves the way for the full ab - initio description of matter - photon systems .
