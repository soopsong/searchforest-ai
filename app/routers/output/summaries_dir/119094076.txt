surface codes based on stabilizer circuits may pave the way for large scale fault - tolerant quantum computation . the surface code uses only single- and two - qubit gates and the error threshold falls close to 1 % for a large range of errors . among the most promising candidates to physically implement such circuits and codes are superconducting qubits coupled by resonators . we investigate a x and z stabilizing circuit realized by two data qubits , two ancillas and four resonators . the aim is to assess the consequences of unitary evolution of the interacting system , in particular for given stable initial states , on fidelities and error syndrome probabilities . we model the system with a jaynes - tavis - cummings hamiltonian and construct the low - excitation level evolution operators . the analysis is limited to two stable input states . we assume an ideal system with perfect gates , perfect measurements and no decoherence or leakage . our analysis shows that the capture probabilities after the execution of a single stabilizer round are not equal to 100 % , but vary between 99.2 % and 99.99 % . this is caused solely by the unitary evolution of the interacting system . two consecutive rounds of stabilizer measurements result in capture probability values that depend heavily on the duration of the evolution , but vary between 0 % and 99 % . also due to the unitary evolution , the final state of the data qubits leaves the the four - dimensional subspace , which results in a state fidelity oscillating between 0 and 1 . even if an error on the qubits is captured , the correcting operation on the qubit will not bring the qubit to the original state . the errors induced by the hamiltonian evolution of the system can not be interpreted nor classified as commonly appearing errors . additional or augmented quantum error correction may be required to compensate these effects of resonator - qubit interaction .
