clustering is a powerful machine learning technique that groups"similar"data points based on their characteristics . many clustering algorithms work by approximating the minimization of an objective function , namely the sum of within - the - cluster distances between points . the straightforward approach involves examining all the possible assignments of points to each of the clusters . this approach guarantees the solution will be a global minimum , however the number of possible assignments scales quickly with the number of data points and becomes computationally intractable even for very small datasets . in order to circumvent this issue , cost function minima are found using popular local - search based heuristic approaches such as k - means and hierarchical clustering . due to their greedy nature , such techniques do not guarantee that a global minimum will be found and can lead to sub - optimal clustering assignments . other classes of global - search based techniques , such as simulated annealing , tabu search , and genetic algorithms may offer better quality results but can be too time consuming to implement . in this work , we describe how quantum annealing can be used to carry out clustering . we map the clustering objective to a quadratic binary optimization ( qubo ) problem and discuss two clustering algorithms which are then implemented on commercially - available quantum annealing hardware , as well as on a purely classical solver"qbsolv . "the first algorithm assigns n data points to k clusters , and the second one can be used to perform binary clustering in a hierarchical manner . we present our results in the form of benchmarks against well - known k - means clustering and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed techniques .
