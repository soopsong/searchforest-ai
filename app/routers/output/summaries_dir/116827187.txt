a local numerical range is analyzed for a family of circulant observables and states of composite $ 2 \otimes d$ systems . it is shown that for any $ 2\otimes d$ circulant operator $ \cal o$ there exists a basis giving rise to the matrix representation with real non - negative off - diagonal elements . in this basis the problem of finding extremum of $ \cal o$ on product vectors $ \ket{x}\otimes \ket{y } \in \mathbb{c}^2\otimes \mathbb{c}^d$ reduces to the corresponding problem in $ \mathbb{r}^2\otimes \mathbb{r}^d$. the final analytical result for $ d=2 $ is presented .
