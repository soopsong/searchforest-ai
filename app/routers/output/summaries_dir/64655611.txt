the purpose of this paper is to study the dynamics of a quantum coherent feedback network composed of two two - level systems ( qubits ) driven by two counter - propagating photons , one in each input channel . the coherent feedback network enhances the nonlinear photon - photon interaction inside the feedback loop . by means of quantum stochastic calculus and the input - output framework , the analytic form of the steady - state output two - photon state is derived . based on the analytic form , the applications on the hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interferometer and marginally stable single - photon devices using this coherent feedback structure have been demonstrated .
