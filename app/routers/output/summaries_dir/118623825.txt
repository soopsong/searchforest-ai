we give general overview of a novel approach , recently developed by us , to address the issue black hole information paradox . this alternative viewpoint is based on theories involving modifications of standard quantum theory , known as"spontaneous dynamical state reduction"or"wave - function collapse models"which were historically developed to overcome the notorious foundational problems of quantum mechanics known as the"measurement problem " . we show that these proposals , when appropriately adapted and refined for this context , provide a self - consistent picture where loss of information in the evaporation of black holes is no longer paradoxical .
