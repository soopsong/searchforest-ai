we suggest an approach to use memristors ( resistors with memory ) in programmable analog circuits . our idea consists in a circuit design in which low voltages are applied to memristors during their operation as analog circuit elements and high voltages are used to program the memristor 's states . this way , as it was demonstrated in recent experiments , the state of memristors does not essentially change during analog mode operation . as an example of our approach , we have built several programmable analog circuits demonstrating memristor - based programming of threshold , gain and frequency .
