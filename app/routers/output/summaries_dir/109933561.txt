we propose an application of a single cooper pair box ( josephson qubit ) for active cooling of nanomechanical resonators . latest experiments with josephson qubits demonstrated that long coherence time of the order of microsecond can be achieved in special symmetry points . here we show that this level of coherence is sufficient to perform an analog of the well known in quantum optics ` ` laser ' ' cooling of a nanomechanical resonator capacitively coupled to the qubit . by applying an ac driving to the qubit or the resonator , resonators with frequency of order 100 mhz and quality factors higher than $ 10 ^ 3 $ can be efficiently cooled down to their ground state , while lower frequency resonators can be cooled down to micro - kelvin temperatures . we also consider an alternative setup where dc - voltage - induced josephson oscillations play the role of the ac driving and show that cooling is possible in this case as well .
