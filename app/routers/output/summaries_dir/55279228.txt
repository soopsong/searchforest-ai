we study in detail the mechanisms causing dephasing of hyperfine coherences of cesium atoms confined by a far off - resonant standing wave optical dipole trap [ s. kuhr et al . , phys . rev . lett . 91 , 213002 ( 2003 ) ] . using ramsey spectroscopy and spin echo techniques , we measure the reversible and irreversible dephasing times of the ground state coherences . we present an analytical model to interpret the experimental data and identify the homogeneous and inhomogeneous dephasing mechanisms . our scheme to prepare and detect the atomic hyperfine state is applied at the level of a single atom as well as for ensembles of up to 50 atoms .
