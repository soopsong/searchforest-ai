we demonstrate a wavelength - tunable , fiber - coupled source of polarization - entangled photons with extremely high spectral brightness and quality of entanglement . using a 25 mm ppktp crystal inside a polarization sagnac interferometer we detect a spectral brightness of 273000 pairs/(s mw nm ) , a factor of 28 better than comparable previous sources while state tomography showed the two - photon state to have a tangle of t=0.987 . this improvement was achieved by use of a long crystal , careful selection of focusing parameters and single - mode fiber coupling . we demonstrate that , due to the particular geometry of the setup , the signal and idler wavelengths can be tuned over a wide range without loss of entanglement .
