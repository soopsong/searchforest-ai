the ` ` jackiw - nair ' ' non - relativistic limit of the relativistic anyon equations provides us with infinite - component wave equations of the dirac - majorana - levy - leblond type for the ` ` exotic ' ' particle , associated with the two - fold central extension of the planar galilei group . an infinite dimensional representation of the galilei group is found . the velocity operator is studied , and the observable coordinates describing a noncommutative plane are identified .
