this paper presents two realizations of linear quantum systems for covariance assignment corresponding to pure gaussian states . the first one is called a cascade realization ; given any covariance matrix corresponding to a pure gaussian state , we can construct a cascaded quantum system generating that state . the second one is called a locally dissipative realization ; given a covariance matrix corresponding to a pure gaussian state , if it satisfies certain conditions , we can construct a linear quantum system that has only local interactions with its environment and achieves the assigned covariance matrix . both realizations are illustrated by examples from quantum optics .
