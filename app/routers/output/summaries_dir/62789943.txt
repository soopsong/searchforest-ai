we predict the occurrence of single - photon - induced entanglement and quantum superposition in a hybrid quantum model , introducing an optomechanical coupling into the rabi model . originally , it comes from the photon - dependent quantum property of ground state featured by the proposed hybrid model . it associates with a single - photon - induced quantum phase transition , and is immune to the $ a^2 $ term of the spin - field interaction . moreover , the obtained quantum superposition state is actual a squeezed cat state , which can give a significant precision enhancement in quantum metrology . this work offers an approach to manipulate entanglement and quantum superposition with a single photon , which might has potential applications in the engineering of new single - photon quantum devices , and also fundamentally broaden the regime of cavity qed .
