an exact correspondence between a black hole and an accelerating mirror is demonstrated . it is shown that for a massless minimally coupled scalar field the same bogolubov coefficients connecting the"in"and"out"states occur for a ( 1 + 1)d flat spacetime with a particular perfectly reflecting accelerating boundary trajectory and a ( 1 + 1)d curved spacetime in which a null shell collapses to form a black hole . generalization of the latter to the ( 3 + 1)d case is discussed . the spectral dynamics is computed in both ( 1 + 1)-dimensional spacetimes along with the energy flux in the spacetime with a mirror . it is shown that the approach to equilibrium is monotonic , asymmetric in terms of the rate , and there is a specific time which characterizes the system when it is the most out - of - equilibrium .
