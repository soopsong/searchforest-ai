anomalous motional heating is a major obstacle to scalable quantum information processing with trapped ions . while the source of this heating is not yet understood , several previous studies suggest that surface contaminants may be largely responsible . we demonstrate an improvement by a factor of four in the room - temperature heating rate of a niobium surface electrode trap by in situ plasma cleaning of the trap surface . this surface treatment was performed with a simple homebuilt coil assembly and commercially - available matching network and is considerably gentler than other treatments , such as ion milling or laser cleaning , that have previously been shown to improve ion heating rates . we do not see an improvement in the heating rate when the trap is operated at cryogenic temperatures , pointing to a role of thermally - activated surface contaminants in motional heating whose activity may freeze out at low temperatures .
