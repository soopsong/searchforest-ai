we show that there are informationally complete joint measurements of two conjugated observables on a finite quantum system , meaning that they enable to identify all quantum states from their measurement outcome statistics . we further demonstrate that it is possible to implement a joint observable as a sequential measurement . if we require minimal noise in the joint measurement , then the joint observable is unique . if the dimension d is odd , then this observable is informationally complete . but if d is even , then the joint observable is not informationally complete and one has to allow more noise in order to obtain informational completeness .
