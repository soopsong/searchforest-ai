transport of excitations along proteins can be formulated in a quantum physics context , based on the periodicity and vibrational modes of the structures . exact solutions are very challenging to obtain on classical computers , however , approximate solutions based on the davydov ansatz have demonstrated the possibility of stabilized solitonic excitations along the protein . we propose an alternative study based on a chain of ultracold atoms . we investigate the experimental parameters to control such a quantum simulator based on dressed rydberg atoms . we show that there is a feasible range of parameters where a quantum simulator can directly mimic the davydov equations and their solutions . such a quantum simulator opens up new directions for the study of transport phenomena in a biophysical context .
