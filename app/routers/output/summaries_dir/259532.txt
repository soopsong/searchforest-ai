we describe the polarization topology of the vector beams emerging from a patterned birefringent liquid crystal plate with a topological charge $ q$ at its center ( $ q$-plate ) . the polarization topological structures for different $ q$-plates and different input polarization states have been studied experimentally by measuring the stokes parameters point - by - point in the beam transverse plane . furthermore , we used a tuned $ q=1/2$-plate to generate cylindrical vector beams with radial or azimuthal polarizations , with the possibility of switching dynamically between these two cases by simply changing the linear polarization of the input beam .
