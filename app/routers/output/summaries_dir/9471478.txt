recent advances in the spectroscopy of biomolecules have highlighted the possibility of quantum coherence playing an active role in biological energy transport . the revelation that quantum coherence can survive in the hot and wet environment of biology has generated a lively debate across both the physics and biology communities . in particular , it remains unclear to what extent non - trivial quantum effects are utilised in biology and what advantage , if any , they afford . we propose an analogue quantum simulator , based on currently available techniques in ultra - cold atom physics , to study a model of energy and electron transport based on the holstein hamiltonian by simulating the salient aspects of a biological system in a tunable laboratory setup , we hope to gain insight into the validity of several theoretical models of biological quantum transport in a variety of relevant parameter regimes .
