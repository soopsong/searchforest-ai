the standard kicked top involves a periodically kicked angular momentum . by considering this angular momentum as a collection of entangled spins , we compute the bipartite entanglement dynamics as a function of the dynamics of the classical counterpart . our numerical results indicate that the entanglement of the quantum top depends on the specific details of the dynamics of the classical top rather than depending universally on the global properties of the classical regime . these results are grounded on linking the entanglement rate to averages involving the classical angular momentum , thereby explaining why regular dynamics can entangle as efficiently as the classically chaotic regime . the findings are in line with previous results obtained with a 2-particle top model , and we show here that the standard kicked top can be obtained as a limiting case of the 2-particle top .
