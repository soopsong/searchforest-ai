we investigate the properties of an atmospheric channel for free space quantum communication with continuous polarization variables . in our prepare - and - measure setup , coherent polarization states are transmitted through an atmospheric quantum channel of 100 m length on the roof of our institute 's building . the signal states are measured by homodyne detection with the help of a local oscillator ( lo ) which propagates in the same spatial mode as the signal , orthogonally polarized to it . thus the interference of signal and lo is excellent and atmospheric fluctuations are autocompensated . the lo also acts as spatial and spectral filter , which allows for unrestrained daylight operation . important characteristics for our system are atmospheric channel influences that could cause polarization , intensity and position excess noise . therefore we study these influences in detail . our results indicate that the channel is suitable for our quantum communication system in most weather conditions .
