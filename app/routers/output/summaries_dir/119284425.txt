we study two different models of optomechanical systems where a temperature gradient between two radiation baths is exploited for inducing self - sustained coherent oscillations of a mechanical resonator . viewed from a thermodynamic perspective , such systems represent quantum instances of self - contained thermal machines converting heat into a periodic mechanical motion and thus they can be interpreted as nano - scale analogues of macroscopic piston engines . our models are potentially suitable for testing fundamental aspects of quantum thermodynamics in the laboratory and for applications in energy efficient nanotechnology .
