we propose a realizable circuit qed architecture for engineering states of a superconducting resonator off - resonantly coupled to an ancillary superconducting qubit . the qubit - resonator dispersive interaction together with a microwave drive applied to the qubit gives rise to a kerr resonator with two - photon driving that enables us to efficiently engineer the quantum state of the resonator such as generation of the schrodinger cat states for resonator - based universal quantum computation . moreover , the presented architecture is easily scalable for solving optimization problem mapped into the ising spin glass model , and thus served as a platform for quantum annealing . although various scalable architecture with superconducting qubits have been proposed for realizing quantum annealer , the existing annealers are currently limited to the coherent time of the qubits . here , based on the protocol for realizing two - photon driven kerr resonator in three - dimensional circuit qed ( 3d cqed ) , we propose a flexible and scalable hardware for implementing quantum annealer that combines the advantage of the long coherence times attainable in 3d cqed and the recently proposed resonator based lechner - hauke - zoller ( lhz ) scheme . in the proposed resonator based lhz annealer , each spin is encoded in the subspace formed by two coherent state of 3d microwave superconducting resonator with opposite phase , and thus the fully - connected ising model is mapped onto the network of the resonator with local tunable three - resonator interaction . this hardware architecture provides a promising physical platform for realizing quantum annealer with improved coherence .
