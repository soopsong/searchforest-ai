quantum repeaters ( qrs ) provide a way of enabling long distance quantum communication by establishing entangled qubits between remote locations . we investigate a new approach to qrs in which quantum information can be faithfully transmitted via a noisy channel without the use of long distance teleportation , thus eliminating the need to establish remote entangled links . our approach makes use of small encoding blocks to fault - tolerantly correct both operational and photon loss errors . we describe a way to optimize the resource requirement for these qrs with the aim of the generation of a secure key . numerical calculations indicate that the number of quantum memory bits required for our scheme has favorable poly - logarithmic scaling with the distance across which the communication is desired .
