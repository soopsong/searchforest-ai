we propose a solution to the problem of realizing a predefined and arbitrary pure quantum state , based on the simultaneous presence of coherent and dissipative dynamics , noncommuting on the target state and in the limit of strong dissipation . more precisely , we obtain a necessary and sufficient criterion whereby the nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) of an open quantum system described by a lindblad master equation approaches a target pure state in the zeno regime , i.e. , for infinitely large dissipative coupling . we also provide an explicit formula for the characteristic dissipative strength beyond which the purity of the ness becomes effective , thus paving the way to an experimental implementation of our criterion . for an illustration , we deal with targeting a bell state , an arbitrary pure state of $ n$ qubits , and a spin - helix state of $ n$ qubits .
