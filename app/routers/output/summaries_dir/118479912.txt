conventional wisdom suggests that realistic quantum repeaters will require quasi - deterministic sources of entangled photon pairs . in contrast , we here study a quantum repeater architecture that uses simple parametric down - conversion sources , as well as frequency - multiplexed multimode quantum memories and photon - number resolving detectors . we show that this approach can significantly extend quantum communication distances compared to direct transmission . this shows that important trade - offs are possible between the different components of quantum repeater architectures .
