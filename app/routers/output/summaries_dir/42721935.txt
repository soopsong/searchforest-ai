we present numerically exact results for the quantum coherent energy transfer in the fenna - matthews - olson molecular aggregate under realistic physiological conditions , including vibrational fluctuations of the protein and the pigments for an experimentally determined fluctuation spectrum . we find coherence times shorter than observed experimentally . furthermore we determine the energy transfer current and quantify its"quantumness"as the distance of the density matrix to the classical pointer states for the energy current operator . most importantly , we find that the energy transfer happens through a"schr\"odinger - cat"like superposition of energy current pointer states .
