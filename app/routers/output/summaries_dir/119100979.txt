quantum walks have been shown to be fruitful tools in analysing the dynamic properties of quantum systems . this article proposes to use quantum walks as an approach to quantum neural networks ( qnns ) . qnns replace binary mcculloch - pitts neurons with a qubit in order to use the advantages of quantum computing in neural networks . a quantum walk on the firing states of such a qnn is supposed to simulate central properties of the dynamics of classical neural networks , such as associative memory . it is shown that a biased discrete hadamard walk derived from the updating process of a biological neuron does not lead to a unitary walk . however , a stochastic quantum walk between the global firing states of a qnn can be constructed and it is shown that it contains the feature of associative memory . the quantum contribution to the walk accounts for a modest speed - up in some regimes .
