we study two models describing the interaction of a two - level system with two quantum field modes . the first one is equivalent to a dissipative two - state system with just two boson fields in the absence of tunneling . the second describes two orthogonal fields interacting with the corresponding orthogonal dipoles of a two - level system . we show that both models present a partial two - mode $ su(2)$ symmetry and that they can be solved in the exceptional case of resonant fields . we study their ground state configurations , that is , we find the quantum precursors of the corresponding semi - classical phase transitions , as well as their whole spectra to infer their integrability . we show that the first model in the exceptional case is isomorphic with the quantum rabi model and allows just two ground state configurations , vacuum and non - vacuum . the second model allows four ground state configurations , one vacuum , two non - vacuum single mode and one non - vacuum dual mode , and give analytic and numerical pointers that may suggest its integrability . we also show that in the single excitation subspace these models can serve as a fast $ su(2)$ beam splitter even in the ultra - strong coupling regime .
