cavity opto - mechanics enabled radiation pressure ( rp ) driven oscillators shown in the past offer an all optical radio frequency ( rf ) source without the need for external electrical feedback . however these oscillators require external tapered fiber or prism coupling and non - standard fabrication processes . in this work , we present a cmos compatible fabrication process to design high optical quality factor opto - mechanical resonators in silicon nitride . the ring resonators designed in this process demonstrate low phase noise rp driven oscillations . using integrated grating couplers and waveguide to couple light to the micro - resonator eliminates 1 / f^3 and other higher order phase noise slopes at close - to - carrier frequencies present in previous demonstrations . we present an rp driven omo operating at 41.97mhz with a signal power of -11dbm and phase noise of -85dbc / hz at 1khz offset with only 1 / f^2 noise down to 10hz offset from carrier .
