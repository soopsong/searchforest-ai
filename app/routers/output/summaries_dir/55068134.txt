we consider the discrete time unitary dynamics given by a quantum walk on $ \z^d$ performed by a particle with internal degree of freedom , called coin state , according to the following iterated rule : a unitary update of the coin state takes place , followed by a shift on the lattice , conditioned on the coin state of the particle . we study the large time behavior of the quantum mechanical probability distribution of the position observable in $ \z^d$ for random updates of the coin states of the following form . the random sequences of unitary updates are given by a site dependent function of a markov chain in time , with the following properties : on each site , they share the same stationnary markovian distribution and , for each fixed time , they form a deterministic periodic pattern on the lattice . we prove a feynman - kac formula to express the characteristic function of the averaged distribution over the randomness at time $ n$ in terms of the nth power of an operator $ m$. by analyzing the spectrum of $ m$ , we show that this distribution posesses a drift proportional to the time and its centered counterpart displays a diffusive behavior with a diffusion matrix we compute . moderate and large deviations principles are also proven to hold for the averaged distribution and the limit of the suitably rescaled corresponding characteristic function is shown to satisfy a diffusion equation . an example of random updates for which the analysis of the distribution can be performed without averaging is worked out . the random distribution displays a deterministic drift proportional to time and its centered counterpart gives rise to a random diffusion matrix whose law we compute . we complete the picture by presenting an uncorrelated example .
