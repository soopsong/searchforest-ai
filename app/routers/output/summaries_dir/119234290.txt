we consider the realization of quantum fredkin gate with only linear optics and single photons . first we construct a heralded fredkin gate using four heralded controlled - not ( cnot ) gates . then we simplify this method to a post - selected one utilizing only two cnot gates . we also give a possible realization of this method which is feasible with current experimental technology . another post - selected scheme requires time entanglement of the input photons but needs no ancillary photons .
