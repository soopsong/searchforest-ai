we propose an efficient microwave - photonic modulator as a resource for stationary entangled microwave - optical fields and develop the theory for deterministic entanglement generation and quantum state transfer in multi - resonant electro - optic systems . the device is based on a single crystal whispering gallery mode resonator integrated into a 3d microwave cavity . the specific design relies on a new combination of thin - film technology and conventional machining that is optimized for the lowest dissipation rates in the microwave , optical and mechanical domains . we extract important device properties from finite element simulations and predict continuous variable entanglement generation rates on the order of a mebit / s for optical pump powers of only a few tens of microwatt . we compare the quantum state transfer fidelities of coherent , squeezed and non - gaussian cat - states for both teleportation and direct conversion protocols under realistic conditions . combining the unique capabilities of circuit quantum electrodynamics with the resilience of fiber optic communication could facilitate long distance solid - state qubit networks , new methods for quantum signal synthesis , quantum key distribution , and quantum enhanced detection , as well as more power - efficient classical sensing and modulation .
