to enable space - based quantum key distribution proposals the centre for quantum technologies is developing a source of entangled photons ruggedized to survive deployment in space and greatly miniaturised so that it conforms to the strict form factor and power requirements of a 1u cubesat . the small photon entangling quantum system is an integrated instrument where the pump , photon pair source and detectors are combined within a single optical tray and electronics package that is no larger than 10 cm x 10 cm x 3 cm . this footprint enables the instrument to be placed onboard nanosatellites or the cubelab structure aboard the international space station . we will discuss the challenges and future prospects of cubesat - based missions .
