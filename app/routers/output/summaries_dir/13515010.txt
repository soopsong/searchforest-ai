we present an efficient quantum algorithm for estimating gauss sums over finite fields and finite rings . this is a natural problem as the description of a gauss sum can be done without reference to a black box function . with a reduction from the discrete logarithm problem to gauss sum estimation we also give evidence that this problem is hard for classical algorithms . the workings of the quantum algorithm rely on the interaction between the additive characters of the fourier transform and the multiplicative characters of the gauss sum .
