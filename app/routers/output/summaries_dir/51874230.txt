we analyze a new computational role of coherent multi - qubit quantum tunneling that gives rise to bands of non - ergodic extended ( nee ) quantum states each formed by a superposition of a large number of computational states ( deep local minima of the energy landscape ) with similar energies . nee provide a mechanism for population transfer ( pt ) between computational states and therefore can serve as a new quantum subroutine for quantum search , quantum parallel tempering and reverse annealing optimization algorithms . we study pt in a quantum n - spin system subject to a transverse field where the energy function $ e(z)$ encodes a classical optimization problem over the set of spin configurations $ z$. given an initial spin configuration with low energy , pt protocol searches for other bitstrings at energies within a narrow window around the initial one . we provide an analytical solution for pt in a simple yet nontrivial model : $ m$ randomly chosen marked bit - strings are assigned energies $ e(z)$ within a narrow strip $ [ -n -w/2 , n + w/2]$ , while the rest of the states are assigned energy 0 . we find that the scaling of a typical pt runtime with n and l is the same as that in the multi - target grover 's quantum search algorithm , except for a factor that is equal to $ \exp(n /(2b^2))$ for finite transverse field $ b\gg1$. unlike the hamiltonians used in analog quantum unstructured search algorithms known so far , the model we consider is non - integrable and population transfer is not exponentially sensitive in n to the weight of the driver hamiltonian . we study numerically the pt subroutine as a part of quantum parallel tempering algorithm for a number of examples of binary optimization problems on fully connected graphs .
