we analyze the simultaneous time - optimal control of two - spin systems . the two non coupled spins which differ in the value of their chemical offsets are controlled by the same magnetic fields . using an appropriate rotating frame , we restrict the study to the case of opposite shifts . we then show that the optimal solution of the inversion problem in a rotating frame is composed of a pulse sequence of maximum intensity and is similar to the optimal solution for inverting only one spin by using a non - resonant control field in the laboratory frame . an example is implemented experimentally using techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance .
