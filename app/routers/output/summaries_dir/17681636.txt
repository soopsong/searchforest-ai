we discuss the scattering of photons from a three - level emitter in a one - dimensional waveguide , where the transport is governed by the interference of spontaneously emitted and directly transmitted waves . the scattering problem is solved in closed form for different level structures . several possible applications are discussed : the state of the emitter can be switched deterministically by raman scattering , thus enabling applications in quantum computing such as a single photon transistor . an array of emitters gives rise to a photonic band gap structure , which can be tuned by a classical driving laser . a disordered array leads to anderson localization of photons , where the localization length can again be controlled by an external driving .
