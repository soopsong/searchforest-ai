we study both experimentally and theoretically the generation of photon pairs by spontaneous four - wave mixing ( sfwm ) in standard birefringent optical fibers . the ability to produce a range of two - photon spectral states , from highly correlated ( entangled ) to completely factorable , by means of cross - polarized birefringent phase matching , is explored . a simple model is developed to predict the spectral state of the photon pair which shows how this can be adjusted by choosing the appropriate pump bandwidth , fiber length and birefringence . spontaneous raman scattering is modeled to determine the tradeoff between sfwm and background raman noise , and the predicted results are shown to agree with experimental data .
