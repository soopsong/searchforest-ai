in this paper we consider circuit synthesis for n - wire linear reversible circuits using the c - not gate library . these circuits are an important class of reversible circuits with applications to quantum computation . previous algorithms , based on gaussian elimination and lu - decomposition , yield circuits with o(n^2 ) gates in the worst - case . however , an information theoretic bound suggests that it may be possible to reduce this to as few as o(n^2 / log n ) gates . we present an algorithm that is optimal up to a multiplicative constant , as well as theta(log n ) times faster than previous methods . while our results are primarily asymptotic , simulation results show that even for relatively small n our algorithm is faster and yields more efficient circuits than the standard method . generically our algorithm can be interpreted as a matrix decomposition algorithm , yielding an asymptotically efficient decomposition of a binary matrix into a product of elementary matrices .
