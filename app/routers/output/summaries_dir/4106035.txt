frequency generators are widely used in electronics . here , we report the design and experimental realization of a memristive frequency generator employing a unique combination of only digital logic gates , a single - supply voltage and a realistic threshold - type memristive device . in our circuit , the oscillator frequency and duty cycle are defined by the switching characteristics of the memristive device and external resistors . we demonstrate the circuit operation both experimentally , using a memristor emulator , and theoretically , using a model memristive device with threshold . importantly , nanoscale realizations of memristive devices offer small - size alternatives to conventional quartz - based oscillators . in addition , the suggested approach can be used for mimicking some cyclic ( sisyphus ) processes in nature , such as"dripping ants"or drops from leaky faucets .
