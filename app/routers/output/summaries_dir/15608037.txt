a theoretical scheme is presented for the adiabatic generation of n - qunit singlet states with $ n\geqslant3 $ , which may be more feasible than previous ones in a cavity . in this proposal , the system may be robust both parameter fluctuations and dissipation along a dark state . in addition , quantum information is only stored in atomic ground states and there is no energy exchanged between atoms and photons in a cavity so as to reduce the influence of atomic spontaneous emission and cavity decays .
