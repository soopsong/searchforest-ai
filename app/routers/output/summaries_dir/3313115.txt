we present a fabrication process for fully superconducting interconnects compatible with superconducting qubit technology . these interconnects allow for the 3d integration of quantum circuits without introducing lossy amorphous dielectrics . they are composed of indium bumps several microns tall separated from an aluminum base layer by titanium nitride which serves as a diffusion barrier . we measure the whole structure to be superconducting ( transition temperature of 1.1$\,$k ) , limited by the aluminum . these interconnects have an average critical current of 26.8$\,$ma , and mechanical shear and thermal cycle testing indicate that these devices are mechanically robust . our process provides a method that reliably yields superconducting interconnects suitable for use with superconducting qubits .
