joint measurements of qubit observables have recently been studied in conjunction with quantum information processing tasks such as cloning . considerations of such joint measurements have until now been restricted to a certain class of observables that can be characterized by a form of covariance . here we investigate conditions for the joint measurability of arbitrary pairs of qubit observables . for pairs of noncommuting sharp qubit observables , a notion of approximate joint measurement is introduced . optimal approximate joint measurements are shown to lie in the class of covariant joint measurements . the marginal observables found to be optimal approximators are generally not among the coarse - grainings of the observables to be approximated . this yields scope for the improvement of existing joint measurement schemes . both the quality of the approximations and the intrinsic unsharpness of the approximators are shown to be subject to heisenberg - type uncertainty relations .
