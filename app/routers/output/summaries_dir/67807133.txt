gaussian states are of increasing interest in the estimation of physical parameters because they are easy to prepare and manipulate in experiments . in this article , we derive formulae for the optimal estimation of parameters using two- and multi - mode gaussian states . as an application of our result , we derive the optimal gaussian probe states for the estimation of the parameter characterizing a one - mode squeezing channel .
