single photon detectors are integral to quantum optics and quantum information . superconducting nanowire based detectors exhibit new levels of performance , but have no accepted quantum optical model that is valid for multiple input photons . by performing detector tomography , we improve the recently proposed model [ m.k . akhlaghi and a.h . majedi , ieee trans . appl . supercond . 19 , 361 ( 2009 ) ] and also investigate the manner in which these detectors respond nonlinearly to light , a valuable feature for some applications . we develop a device independent model for single photon detectors that incorporates this nonlinearity .
