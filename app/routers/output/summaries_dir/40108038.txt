in this paper , we investigate the dynamics of quantum linear systems where the input signals are multi - channel multi - photon states , namely states determined by a definite number of photons superposed in multiple input channels . in contrast to most existing studies on separable input states in the literature , we allow the existence of quantum correlation ( for example quantum entanglement ) in these multi - channel multi - photon input states . due to the prevalence of quantum correlations in the quantum regime , the results presented in this paper are very general . moreover , the multi - channel multi - photon states studied here are reasonably mathematically tractable . three types of multi - photon states are considered : 1 ) $ m$ photons superposed among $ m$ channels , 2 ) $ n$ photons superposed among $ m$ channels where $ n\geq m$ , and 3 ) $ n$ photons superposed among $ m$ channels where $ n$ is an arbitrary positive integer . formulae for intensities and states of output fields are derived . examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results .
