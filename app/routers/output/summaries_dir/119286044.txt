we propose that a pulsed quantum optomechanical system can be applied for the problem of quantum parameter estimation , which targets to yield higher precision of parameter estimation utilizing quantum resource than that using classical methods . mainly concentrating on the quantum fisher information with respect to the mechanical frequency , we find that the corresponding precision of parameter estimation on the mechanical frequency can be enhanced by applying applicable optical resonant pulsed driving on the cavity of the optome- chanical system . further investigation shows that the mechanical squeezing resulting from the optical pulsed driving is the quantum resource used in optimal quantum estimation on the frequency .
