we introduce a systematic framework to calculate the bipartite entanglement entropy of a compact spatial subsystem in a one - dimensional quantum gas which can be mapped into a noninteracting fermion system . we show that when working with a finite number of particles n , the renyi entanglement entropies grow as log n , with a prefactor that is given by the central charge . we apply this novel technique to the ground state and to excited states of periodic systems . we also consider systems with boundaries . we derive universal formulas for the leading behavior and for subleading corrections to the scaling . the universality of the results allows us to make predictions for the finite - size scaling forms of the corrections to the scaling .
