we investigate a chain of superconducting stripline resonators , each interacting with a transmon qubit , that are capacitively coupled in a row . we show that the dynamics of this system can be described by a bose - hubbard hamiltonian with attractive interactions for polaritons , superpositions of photons and qubit excitations . this setup we envisage constitutes one of the first platforms where all technological components that are needed to experimentally study chains of strongly interacting polaritons have already been realized . by driving the first stripline resonator with a microwave source and detecting the output field of the last stripline resonator one can spectroscopically probe properties of the system in the driven dissipative regime . we calculate the stationary polariton density and density - density correlations $ g^{(2)}$ for the last cavity which can be measured via the output field . our results display a transition from a coherent to a quantum field as the ratio of on site interactions to driving strength is increased .
