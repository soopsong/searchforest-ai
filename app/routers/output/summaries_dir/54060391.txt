we present a scheme for simulating relativistic quantum physics in circuit quantum electrodynamics . by using three classical microwave drives , we show that a superconducting qubit strongly - coupled to a resonator field mode can be used to simulate the dynamics of the dirac equation and klein paradox in all regimes . using the same setup we also propose the implementation of the foldy - wouthuysen canonical transformation , after which the time derivative of the position operator becomes a constant of the motion .
