in this paper , the problem of constructing an efficient quantum circuit for the implementation of an arbitrary quantum computation is addressed . to this end , a basic block based on the cosine - sine decomposition method is suggested which contains $ l$ qubits . in addition , a previously proposed quantum - logic synthesis method based on quantum shannon decomposition is recursively applied to reach unitary gates over $ l$ qubits . then , the basic block is used and some optimizations are applied to remove redundant gates . it is shown that the exact value of $ l$ affects the number of one - qubit and cnot gates in the proposed method . in comparison to the previous synthesis methods , the value of $ l$ is examined consequently to improve either the number of cnot gates or the total number of gates . the proposed approach is further analyzed by considering the nearest neighbor limitation . according to our evaluation , the number of cnot gates is increased by at most a factor of $ \frac{5}{3}$ if the nearest neighbor interaction is applied .
