the linear momentum and angular momentum of virtual photons of quantum vacuum fluctuations can induce the casimir force and the casimir torque , respectively . while the casimir force has been measured extensively , the casimir torque has not been observed experimentally though it was predicted over forty years ago . here we propose to detect the casimir torque with an optically levitated nanorod near a birefringent plate in vacuum . the axis of the nanorod tends to align with the polarization direction of the linearly polarized optical tweezer . when its axis is not parallel or perpendicular to the optical axis of the birefringent crystal , it will experience a casimir torque that shifts its orientation slightly . we calculate the casimir torque and casimir force acting on a levitated nanorod near a birefringent crystal . we also investigate the effects of thermal noise and photon recoils on the torque and force detection . we prove that a levitated nanorod in vacuum will be capable of detecting the casimir torque under realistic conditions .
