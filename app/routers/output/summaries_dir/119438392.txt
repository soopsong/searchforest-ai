general quasi - probabilities are introduced to visualize time - dependent quantum correlations of light in phase space . they are based on the generalization of the glauber - sudarshan p function to a time - dependent p functional [ w. vogel , phys . rev . lett . 100 , 013605 ( 2008 ) ] , which fully describes temporal correlations of radiation fields on the basis of continuous phase - space distributions . this approach is nontrivial as the p functional itself is highly singular for many quantum states and nonlinear processes . in general , it neither yields a well - behaved nor an experimentally accessible description of quantum stochastic processes . our regularized version of this multi - time - dependent quasi - probability is a smooth function and applies to stronger divergences compared to the single - time and multi - mode scenario . the technique is used to characterize an optical parametric process with frequency mismatch . a measurement scheme , together with a sampling approach , is provided which yields direct experimental access to the regularized p functional from measured data .
