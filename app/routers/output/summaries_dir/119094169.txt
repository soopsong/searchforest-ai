the four - qubit states $ \lvert\chi^{ij}\rangle$ , exhibiting genuinely multi - partite entanglement have been shown to have many interesting properties and have been suggested for novel applications in quantum information processing . in this work we propose a simple quantum circuit and its corresponding optical embodiment with which to prepare photon pairs in the $ \lvert\chi^{ij}\rangle$ states . our approach uses hyper - entangled photon pairs , produced by the type - i spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) process in two contiguous nonlinear crystals , together with a set of simple linear - optical transformations . our photon pairs are maximally hyper - entangled in both their polarisation and orbital angular momentum ( oam ) . after one of these daughter photons passes through our optical setup , we obtain photon pairs in the hyper - entangled state $ \lvert\chi^{00}\rangle$ , and the $ \lvert\chi^{ij}\rangle$ states can be achieved by further simple transformations .
