the purpose of this paper is to prove a local optimality property of a recently proposed coherent feedback configuration for distributed generation of epr entanglement using two nondegenerate optical parametric amplifiers ( nopas ) in the idealized infinite bandwidth limit . this local optimality is with respect to a class of similar coherent feedback configurations but employing different unitary scattering matrices , representing different scattering of propagating signals within the network . the infinite bandwidth limit is considered as it significantly simplifies the analysis , allowing local optimality criteria to be explicitly verified . nonetheless , this limit is relevant for the finite bandwidth scenario as it provides an accurate approximation to the epr entanglement in the low frequency region where epr entanglement exists .
