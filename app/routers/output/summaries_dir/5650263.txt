we investigate a two - electron double quantum dot with both spin and valley degrees of freedom as they occur in graphene , carbon nanotubes , or silicon , and regard the 16-dimensional space with one electron per dot as a four - qubit logic space . in the spin - only case , it is well known that the exchange coupling between the dots combined with arbitrary single - qubit operations is sufficient for universal quantum computation . the presence of the valley degeneracy in the electronic band structure alters the form of the exchange coupling and in general leads to spin - valley entanglement . here , we show that universal quantum computation can still be performed by exchange interaction and single - qubit gates in the presence of the additional ( valley ) degree of freedom . we present an explicit pulse sequence for a spin - only controlled - not consisting of the generalized exchange coupling and single - electron spin and valley rotations . we also propose state preparations and projective measurements with the use of adiabatic transitions between states with ( 1,1 ) and ( 0,2 ) charge distributions similar to the spin - only case , but with the additional requirement of controlling the spin and the valley zeeman energies by an external magnetic field . finally , we demonstrate a universal two - qubit gate between a spin and a valley qubit , allowing universal gate operations on the combined spin and valley quantum register .
