we propose a two qubit experiment for validating tunable antiferromagnetic $ xx$ interactions in quantum annealing . such interactions allow the time - dependent hamiltonian to be non - stoquastic , and the instantaneous ground state can have negative amplitudes in the computational basis . our construction relies on how the degeneracy of the ising hamiltonian 's ground states is broken away from the end point of the anneal : above a certain value of the antiferromagnetic $ xx$ interaction strength , the perturbative ground state at the end of the anneal changes from a symmetric to an antisymmetric state . this change is associated with a suppression of one of the ising ground states , which can then be detected using solely computational basis measurements . we show that a semiclassical approximation of the annealing protocol fails to reproduce this feature , making it a candidate ` quantum signature ' of the evolution .
