together with photon emission , the absorption of a single photon by a single atom is a fundamental process in matter - light interaction that manifests its quantum mechanical nature . as an experimentally controlled process , it is a key tool for the realization of quantum technologies . in particular , in an atom / photon based quantum network scenario , in which localized atomic particles are used as quantum information processing nodes while photons are used as carriers of quantum information between distant nodes , controlling both emission and absorption of single photons by single atoms is required for quantum coherent state mapping between the two entities . most experimental efforts to date have focused on establishing the control of single photon emission by single trapped atoms , and the implementation of quantum networking protocols using this interaction . in this chapter , we describe experimental efforts to control the process of single photon absorption by single trapped ions . we describe a series of experiments in which polarization entangled photon pairs , generated by a spontaneous parametric down - conversion source , are coupled to a single ion . first the source is operated to generate heralded single photons , and coincidences between the absorption event of one photon of the pair and the detection of the heralding partner photon are observed . we then show how polarization control in the process is established , leading to the manifestation of the photonic polarization entanglement in the absorption process . finally , we introduce protocols in which this interaction scheme is harnessed to perform tasks in a quantum network , such as entanglement distribution among distant nodes of the network , and we demonstrate a specific protocol for heralded , high - fidelity photon - to - atom quantum state transfer .
