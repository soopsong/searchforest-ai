we discuss the problem of determining whether the state of several quantum mechanical subsystems is entangled . as in previous work on two subsystems we introduce a procedure for checking separability that is based on finding state extensions with appropriate properties and may be implemented as a semidefinite program . the main result of this work is to show that there is a series of tests of this kind such that if a multiparty state is entangled this will eventually be detected by one of the tests . the procedure also provides a means of constructing entanglement witnesses that could in principle be measured in order to demonstrate that the state is entangled .
