we study the propagation of entanglement after quantum quenches in the non - integrable para - magnetic quantum ising spin chain . tuning the parameters of the system , we observe a sudden increase in the entanglement production rate , which we show to be related to the appearance of new quasi - particle excitations in the post - quench spectrum . we argue that the phenomenon is the non - equilibrium version of the well - known gibbs paradox related to mixing entropy and demonstrate that its characteristics fit the expectations derived from the quantum resolution of the paradox in systems with a non - trivial quasi - particle spectrum .
