a universal quantum computer of a moderate scale is not available yet , however intermediate models of quantum computation would still permit demonstrations of a quantum computational advantage over classical computing . one of these models , based on single photons interacting via linear optics , is called boson sampling . proof - of - principle boson sampling has been demonstrated , but the number of photons used for these demonstrations is well below any claim of quantum computational advantage . to circumvent this problem , here we present a new pathway to scale boson sampling experiments by combining continuous - variables quantum information and temporal encoding . in our proposal , we use dual - homodyne and single - photon detections . by simply switching detection methods the performance of the device can be verified with a number of measurement samples growing polynomially in the number of photons . all building blocks of our proposal have been successfully demonstrated and have shown good performance for scaling . this proposal is within the reach of current technology .
