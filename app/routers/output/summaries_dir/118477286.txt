we experimentally and theoretically investigate the quantum trajectories of jointly monitored transmon qubits embedded in spatially separated microwave cavities . using nearly quantum - noise limited superconducting amplifiers and an optimized setup to reduce signal loss between cavities , we can efficiently track measurement - induced entanglement generation as a continuous process for single realizations of the experiment . the quantum trajectories of transmon qubits naturally split into low and high entanglement classes corresponding to half - parity collapse . the distribution of concurrence is found at any given time and we explore the dynamics of entanglement creation in the state space . the distribution exhibits a sharp cut - off in the high concurrence limit , defining a maximal concurrence boundary . the most likely paths of the qubits ' trajectories are also investigated , resulting in three probable paths , gradually projecting the system to two even subspaces and an odd subspace . we also investigate the most likely time for the individual trajectories to reach their most entangled state , and find that there are two solutions for the local maximum , corresponding to the low and high entanglement routes . the theoretical predictions show excellent agreement with the experimental entangled qubit trajectory data .
