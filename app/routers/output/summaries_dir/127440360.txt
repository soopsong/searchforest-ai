we present an analytical method for the two - qubit quantum rabi model . while still operating in the frame of the generalized rotating - wave approximation ( grwa ) , our method further embraces the idea of introducing variational parameters . the optimal value of the variational parameter is determined by minimizing the energy function of the ground state . comparing with numerical exact results , we show that our method evidently improves the accuracy of the conventional grwa in calculating fundamental physical quantities , such as energy spectra , mean photon number , and dynamics . interestingly , the accuracy of our method allows us to reproduce the asymptotic behavior of mean photon number in large frequency ratio for the ground state and investigate the quasi - periodical structure of the time evolution , which are incapable of being predicted by the grwa . the applicable parameter ranges cover the ultrastrong coupling regime , which will be helpful to recent experiments .
