the single - photon scattering in a rectangular waveguide by a v - type three - level emitter is studied for large range of input - photon energy beyond the single - mode region . by using lippmann - schwinger formalism , the necessary and sufficient conditions of complete transmission and complete reflection are derived analytically . in the single - mode region , the complete transmission caused by electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and the complete reflection due to fano resonance can both be achieved by adjusting the emitter 's parameters . but in the multi - mode region , except that the input - state is prepared in a coherent superposition state , the perfect reflection is absent , and the photon inevitably enters other propagation modes due to the indirectly interaction between waveguide modes mediated by the emitter . other remarkable features in the photon transport induced by the finite cross section includes the blueshift of the reflection resonance and the cutoff - frequency effect .
