we introduce a new class of continuous matrix product ( cmp ) states and establish the stochastic master equations ( quantum filters ) for an arbitrary quantum system probed by a bosonic input field in this class of states . we show that this class of cmp states arise naturally as outputs of a markovian model , and that input fields in these states lead to master and filtering ( quantum trajectory ) equations which are matrix - valued . furthermore , it is shown that this class of continuous matrix product states include the ( continuous - mode ) single photon and time - ordered multi - photon states .
