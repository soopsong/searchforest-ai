we investigate which pure states of $ n$ photons in $ d$ modes can be transformed into each other via linear optics , without post - selection . in other words , we study the local unitary ( lu ) equivalence classes of symmetric many - qudit states . writing our state as $ f^\dagger|\omega\rangle$ , with $ f^\dagger$ a homogeneous polynomial in the mode creation operators , we propose two sets of lu - invariants : ( a ) spectral invariants , which are the eigenvalues of the operator $ ff^\dagger$ , and ( b ) moments , each given by the norm of the symmetric component of a tensor power of the initial state , which can be computed as vacuum expectation values of $ f^k(f^\dagger)^k$. we provide scheme for experimental measurement of the later , as related to the post - selection probability of creating state $ f^{\dagger k}|\omega\rangle$ from $ k$ copies of $ f^{\dagger}|\omega\rangle$.
