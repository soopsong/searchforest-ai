we study the application of decoupling techniques to the case of a damped vibrational mode of a chain of trapped ions , which can be used as a quantum bus in linear ion trap quantum computers . we show that vibrational heating could be efficiently suppressed using appropriate ` ` parity kicks ' ' . we also show that vibrational decoherence can be suppressed by this decoupling procedure , even though this is generally more difficult because the rate at which the parity kicks have to applied increases with the effective bath temperature .
