we investigate the phase enhancement of quantum states subject to non - linear phase shifts . the optimal phase estimation of even entangled coherent states ( ecss ) is shown to be better than that of noon states and of odd ecs states with the same average particle number < n > and non - linearity exponent k. we investigate the creation of approximate ecss ( aecss ) from a squeezed vacuum with current optical technology methods and find that a pure aecs is even slightly better than an even ecs for large < n > . we also examine simple but physically relevant cases of loss in the non - linear interferometer arm , for a fixed < n > .
