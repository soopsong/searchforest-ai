decoherence is the main obstacle to the realization of quantum computers . until recently it was thought that quantum error correcting codes are the only complete solution to the decoherence problem . here we present an alternative that is based on a combination of a decoherence - free subspace encoding and the application of strong and fast pulses : ` ` encoded recoupling and decoupling ' ' ( erd ) . this alternative has the advantage of lower encoding overhead ( as few as two physical qubits per logical qubit suffice ) , and direct application to a number of promising proposals for the experimental realization of quantum computers .
