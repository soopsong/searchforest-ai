we propose a unitary procedure to reconstruct quantum secret for a quantum secret sharing scheme constructed from stabilizer quantum error - correcting codes . erasure correcting procedures for stabilizer codes need to add missing shares for reconstruction of quantum secret while unitary reconstruction procedures for certain class of quantum secret sharing are known to work without adding missing shares . the proposed procedure also works without adding missing shares .
