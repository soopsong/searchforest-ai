in this paper , the interaction between a $ \lambda$-type three - level atom and two - mode cavity field is discussed . the detuning parameters and cross - kerr nonlinearity are taken into account and it is assumed that atom - field coupling and kerr medium to be $ f$-deformed . even though the system seems to be complicated , the analytical form of the state vector of the entire system for considered model is exactly obtained . the time evolution of nonclassical properties such as quantum entanglement and position - momentum entropic uncertainty relation ( entropy squeezing ) of the field are investigated . in each case , the influences of the detuning parameters , generalized kerr medium and intensity - dependent coupling on the latter nonclassicality signs are analyzed , in detail .
