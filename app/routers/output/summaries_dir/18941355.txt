in this paper , we treat the quantum filtering problem for multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) markovian open quantum systems coupled to multiple boson fields in an arbitrary zero - mean jointly gaussian state , using the reference probability approach formulated by bouten and van handel as a quantum version of a well - known method of the same name from classical nonlinear filtering theory , and exploiting the generalized araki - woods representation of gough . this includes gaussian field states such as vacuum , squeezed vacuum , thermal , and squeezed thermal states as special cases . the contribution is a derivation of the general quantum filtering equation ( or stochastic master equation as they are known in the quantum optics community ) in the full mimo setup for any zero - mean jointy gaussian input field states , up to some mild rank assumptions on certain matrices relating to the measurement vector .
