a way to pose the entropic uncertainty principle for trace - preserving super - operators is presented . it is based on the notion of extremal unraveling of a super - operator . for given input state , different effects of each unraveling result in some probability distribution at the output . as it is shown , all tsallis ' entropies of positive order as well as some of renyi 's entropies of this distribution are minimized by the same unraveling of a super - operator . entropic relations between a state ensemble and the generated density matrix are revisited in terms of both the adopted measures . using riesz 's theorem , we obtain two uncertainty relations for any pair of generalized resolutions of the identity in terms of the renyi and tsallis entropies . the inequality with renyi 's entropies is an improvement of the previous one , whereas the inequality with tsallis ' entropies is a new relation of a general form . the latter formulation is explicitly shown for a pair of complementary observables in a $ d$-level system and for the angle and the angular momentum . the derived general relations are immediately applied to extremal unravelings of two super - operators .
