we discuss two methods that , through a combination of cyclically gluing copies of a given $ n$-party boundary state in ads / cft and a canonical purification , creates a bulk geometry that contains a boundary homologous minimal surface with area equal to 2 or 4 times the $ n$-party entanglement wedge cross - section , depending on the parity of the party number and choice of method . the areas of the minimal surfaces are each dual to entanglement entropies that we define to be candidates for the $ n$-party reflected entropy . in the context of ads$_3$/cft$_2 $ , we provide a boundary interpretation of our construction as a multiboundary wormhole , and conjecture that this interpretation generalizes to higher dimensions .
