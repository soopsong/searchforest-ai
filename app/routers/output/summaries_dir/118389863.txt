we give an explicit expression for the geometric measure of entanglement for three qubit states that are linear combinations of four orthogonal product states . it turns out that the geometric measure for these states has three different expressions depending on the range of definition in parameter space . each expression of the measure has its own geometrically meaningful interpretation . such an interpretation allows oneself to take one step toward a complete understanding for the general properties of the entanglement measure . the states that lie on joint surfaces separating different ranges of definition , designated as shared states , seem to have particularly interesting features . the properties of the shared states are fully discussed .
