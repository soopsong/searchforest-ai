we study the properties of an array of qed - cavities coupled by nonlinear elements in the presence of photon leakage and driven by a coherent source . the main effect of the nonlinear couplings is to provide an effective cross - kerr interaction between nearest - neighbor cavities . additionally , correlated photon hopping between neighboring cavities arises . we provide a detailed mean - field analysis of the steady - state phase diagram as a function of the system parameters , the leakage , and the external driving , and show the emergence of a number of different quantum phases . a photon crystal associated to a spatial modulation of the photon blockade appears . the steady state can also display oscillating behavior and bistability . in some regions the crystalline ordering may coexist with the oscillating behavior . furthermore we study the effect of short - range quantum fluctuations by employing a cluster mean - field analysis . focusing on the corrections to the photon crystal boundaries , we show that , apart for some quantitative differences , the cluster mean field supports the findings of the simple single - site analysis . in the last part of the paper we concentrate on the possibility to build up the class of arrays introduced here , by means of superconducting circuits of existing technology . we consider a realistic choice of the parameters for this specific implementation and discuss some properties of the steady - state phase diagram .
