correlated photon pairs are a fundamental building block of quantum photonic systems . while pair sources have previously been integrated on silicon chips built using customized photonics manufacturing processes , these often take advantage of only a small fraction of the established techniques for microelectronics fabrication and have yet to be integrated in a process which also supports electronics . here we report the first demonstration of quantum - correlated photon pair generation in a device fabricated in an unmodified advanced ( sub-100 nm ) complementary metal - oxide - semiconductor ( cmos ) process , alongside millions of working transistors . the microring resonator photon pair source is formed in the transistor layer structure , with the resonator core formed by the silicon layer typically used for the transistor body . with ultra - low continuous - wave on - chip pump powers ranging from 5 $ \mu$w to 400 $ \mu$w , we demonstrate pair generation rates between 165 hz and 332 khz using>80 % efficient wsi superconducting nanowire single photon detectors . coincidences - to - accidentals ratios consistently exceeding 40 were measured with a maximum of 55 . in the process of characterizing this source we also accurately predict pair generation rates from the results of classical four - wave mixing measurements . this proof - of - principle device demonstrates the potential of commercial cmos microelectronics as an advanced quantum photonics platform with capability of large volume , pristine process control , and where state - of - the - art high - speed digital circuits could interact with quantum photonic circuits .
