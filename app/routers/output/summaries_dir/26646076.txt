it is argued using a gedankenexperiment that a scalable quantum memory could be used as a perpetuum mobile of the second kind and hence can not be realized in nature . the reasoning is based on the assumption that the landauer 's principle for measurements is a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics and not an independent postulate . this implies a modification of the landauer 's principle when applied for discrimination of equilibrium ( metastable ) states . while identification of the metastable state can be done at the infinitesimally low cost , a change of such a state involves dissipation of energy proportional to its stability factor .
