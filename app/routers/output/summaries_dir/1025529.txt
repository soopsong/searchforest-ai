consider a discrete - time quantum walk on the $ n$-cycle governed by the following condition : at every time step of the walk , the option persists , with probability $ p$ , of exercising a projective measurement on the coin degree of freedom . for a bipartite quantum system of this kind , we prove that the von neumann entropy of the total density operator converges to its maximum value . thus , when influenced by decoherence , the mutual information between the two subsystems , corresponding respectively to the space of the coin and the space of the walker , eventually must diminish to zero . to put it plainly , any level of decoherence greater than zero forces the system eventually to become completely"disentangled " . }
