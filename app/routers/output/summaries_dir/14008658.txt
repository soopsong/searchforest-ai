quantum interface links stationary qubits in quantum memory with flying photonic qubits in optical transmission channels and constitutes a critical element for future quantum internet . entanglement of quantum interfaces is a key step for realization of quantum networks . through heralded detection of photon interference , here we generate multipartite entanglement between 25 ( or 9 ) individually addressable quantum interfaces in a multiplexed atomic quantum memory array and confirm genuine 22 ( or 9 ) partite entanglement , respectively . experimental entanglement of a record - high number of quantum interfaces makes an important enabling step towards realization of quantum networks , long - distance quantum communication , and multipartite quantum information processing .
