quantum communication protocols can be significantly enhanced by careful preparation of the wavepackets of the utilized photons . following the theoretical proposal published recently by our group , we experimentally demonstrate the effect of remote temporal wavepacket narrowing of a heralded single photon produced via spontaneous parametric down - conversion . this is done by utilizing a time - resolved measurement on the heralding photon which is frequency - entangled with the heralded photon . we then investigate optimal photon pair source characteristics to minimize heralded wavepacket width .
