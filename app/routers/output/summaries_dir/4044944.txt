the realization of reliable quantum channels , able to transfer a quantum state with high fidelity , is a fundamental step in the construction of scalable quantum devices . in this paper we describe a transmission scheme based on the genuinely quantum effect known as bloch oscillations . the proposed protocol makes it possible to carry quantum state over different distances with a minimal engineering of the transmission medium and can be implemented and verified on current quantum technology hardware .
