inspired by the condensed - matter analogues of black holes , we study the quantum correlations across the event horizon reflecting the entanglement between the outgoing particles of the hawking radiation and their in - falling partners . for a perfectly covariant theory , the total correlation is conserved in time and piles up arbitrary close to the horizon in the past , where it merges into the singularity of the vacuum two - point function at the light cone . after modifying the dispersion relation ( i.e. , breaking lorentz invariance ) for large $ k$ , on the other hand , the light cone is smeared out and the entanglement is not conserved but actually created in a given rate per unit time .
