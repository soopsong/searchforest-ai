following recent developments in quantum pageranking , we present a comparative analysis of discrete - time and continuous - time quantum - walk - based pagerank algorithms . for the discrete - time case , we introduce an alternative pagerank measure based on the maximum probabilities achieved by the walker on the nodes . we demonstrate that the required time of evolution does not scale significantly with increasing network size . we affirm that all three quantum pagerank measures considered here distinguish clearly between outerplanar hierarchical , scale - free , and erd\"os - r\'enyi network types . relative to classical pagerank and to different extents , the quantum measures better highlight secondary hubs and resolve ranking degeneracy among peripheral nodes for the networks we studied in this paper .
