we propose a statistical framework for the problem of parameter estimation from a noisy optomechanical system . the cram\'er - rao lower bound on the estimation errors in the long - time limit is derived and compared with the errors of radiometer and expectation - maximization ( em ) algorithms in the estimation of the force noise power . when applied to experimental data , the em estimator is found to have the lowest error and follow the cram\'er - rao bound most closely . our analytic results are envisioned to be valuable to optomechanical experiment design , while the em algorithm , with its ability to estimate most of the system parameters , is envisioned to be useful for optomechanical sensing , atomic magnetometry , and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics .
