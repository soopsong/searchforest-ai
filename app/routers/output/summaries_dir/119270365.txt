the"lewis - riesenfeld phases"which plays a crucial role in constructing shortcuts to adiabaticity may be a resource for the implementation of quantum phase gates . by combining"lewis - riesenfeld invariant"with"quantum zeno dynamics " , we propose an effective scheme of rapidly implementing $ \pi$ phase gates via constructing shortcuts to adiabatic passage in a two - distant - atom - cavity system . the influence of various decoherence processes such as spontaneous emission and photon loss on the fidelity is discussed . it is noted that this scheme is insensitive to both two error sources . additionally , a creation of n - atom cluster states is put forward as a typical example of the applications of the fast and noise - resistant phase gates . the study results show that the shortcuts idea is not only applicable in other logic gates with different systems , but also propagable for many quantum information tasks .
