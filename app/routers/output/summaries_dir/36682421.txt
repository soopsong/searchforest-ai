we discuss the spectral structure and decomposition of multi - photon states . ordinarily ` multi - photon states ' and ` fock states ' are regarded as synonymous . however , when the spectral degrees of freedom are included this is not the case , and the class of ` multi - photon ' states is much broader than the class of ` fock ' states . we discuss the criteria for a state to be considered a fock state . we then address the decomposition of general multi - photon states into bases of orthogonal eigenmodes , building on existing multi - mode theory , and introduce an occupation number representation that provides an elegant description of such states that in many situations simplifies calculations . finally we apply this technique to several example situations , which are highly relevant for state of the art experiments . these include hong - ou - mandel interference , spectral filtering , finite bandwidth photo - detection , homodyne detection and the conditional preparation of schr\"odinger kitten and fock states . our techniques allow for very simple descriptions of each of these examples .
