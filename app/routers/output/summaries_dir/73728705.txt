this paper shows that pairwise pagerank orders emerge from two - hop walks . the main tool used here refers to a specially designed sign - mirror function and a parameter curve , whose low - order derivative information implies pairwise pagerank orders with high probability . we study the pairwise correct rate by placing the google matrix $ \textbf{g}$ in a probabilistic framework , where $ \textbf{g}$ may be equipped with different random ensembles for model - generated or real - world networks with sparse , small - world , scale - free features , the proof of which is mixed by mathematical and numerical evidence . we believe that the underlying spectral distribution of aforementioned networks is responsible for the high pairwise correct rate . moreover , the perspective of this paper naturally leads to an $ o(1)$ algorithm for any single pairwise pagerank comparison if assuming both $ \textbf{a}=\textbf{g}-\textbf{i}_n$ , where $ \textbf{i}_n$ denotes the identity matrix of order $ n$ , and $ \textbf{a}^2 $ are ready on hand ( e.g. , constructed offline in an incremental manner ) , based on which it is easy to extract the top $ k$ list in $ o(kn)$ , thus making it possible for pagerank algorithm to deal with super large - scale datasets in real time .
