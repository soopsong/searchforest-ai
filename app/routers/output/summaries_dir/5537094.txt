we construct a family of time - independent nearest - neighbor hamiltonians coupling eight - state systems on a 1d ring that enables universal quantum computation . hamiltonians in this family can achieve universality either by driving a continuous - time quantum walk or by terminating an adiabatic algorithm . in either case , the universality property can be understood as arising from an efficient simulation of a programmable quantum circuit . using gadget perturbation theory , one can demonstrate the same kind of universality for related hamiltonian families acting on qubits in 2d . our results demonstrate that simulating 1d chains of spin-7/2 particles is bqp - hard , and indeed bqp - complete because the outputs of decision problems can be encoded in the outputs of such simulations .
