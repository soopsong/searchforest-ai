the balance between exploration and exploitation is a key problem for reinforcement learning methods , especially for q - learning . in this paper , a fidelity - based probabilistic q - learning ( fpql ) approach is presented to naturally solve this problem and applied for learning control of quantum systems . in this approach , fidelity is adopted to help direct the learning process and the probability of each action to be selected at a certain state is updated iteratively along with the learning process , which leads to a natural exploration strategy instead of a pointed one with configured parameters . a probabilistic q - learning ( pql ) algorithm is first presented to demonstrate the basic idea of probabilistic action selection . then the fpql algorithm is presented for learning control of quantum systems . two examples ( a spin- 1/2 system and a lamda - type atomic system ) are demonstrated to test the performance of the fpql algorithm . the results show that fpql algorithms attain a better balance between exploration and exploitation , and can also avoid local optimal policies and accelerate the learning process .
