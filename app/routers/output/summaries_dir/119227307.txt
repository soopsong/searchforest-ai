energy transport is of central importance in understanding a wide variety of transitions of physical states in nature . recently , the coherence and noise have been identified for their existence and key roles in energy transport processes , for instance , in a photosynthesis complex , dna , and odor sensing etc , of which one may have to reveal the inner mechanics in the quantum regime . here we present an analog of newton 's cradle by manipulating a boundary - controlled chain on a photonic chip . long - range interactions can be mediated by a long chain composed of 21 strongly coupled sites , where single - photon excitations are transferred between two remote sites via simultaneous control of inter - site weak and strong couplings . we observe a high retrieval efficiency in both uniform and defect - doped chain structures . our results may offer a flexible approach to hamiltonian engineering beyond geometric limitation , enabling the design and construction of quantum simulators on demand .
