in this work , we propose an adder for the 2d ntc architecture , designed to match the architectural constraints of many quantum computing technologies . the chosen architecture allows the layout of logical qubits in two dimensions and the concurrent execution of one- and two - qubit gates with nearest - neighbor interaction only . the proposed adder works in three phases . in the first phase , the first column generates the summation output and the other columns do the carry - lookahead operations . in the second phase , these intermediate values are propagated from column to column , preparing for computation of the final carry for each register position . in the last phase , each column , except the first one , generates the summation output using this column - level carry . the depth and the number of qubits of the proposed adder are $ \theta(\sqrt{n})$ and o(n ) , respectively . the proposed adder executes faster than the adders designed for the 1d ntc architecture when the length of the input registers $ n$ is larger than 58 .
