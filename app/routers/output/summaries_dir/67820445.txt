photonics is a promising architecture for the realisation of quantum information processing , since the two - photon interaction , or non - linearity , necessary to build logical gates can efficiently be realised by the use of interference with ancillary photons and detection . although single - photon sources and detectors are pivotal in realisations of such systems , clear guidelines for the required performance of realistic systems are yet to be defined . we present our detailed numerical simulation of several quantum optics circuits including sources and detectors all represented in multi - dimensional fockspaces , which allows to obtain experimentally realistic performance bounds for for these devices . in addition , the single - photon source based on switched parametric down - conversion is studied , which in principle could reach the required performance . three approaches for implementing the switching hierarchy of the photons are simulated , and their anticipated performance is obtained . our results define the bar for the optical devices needed to achieve the first level of linear - optics quantum computing outside the coincidence basis .
