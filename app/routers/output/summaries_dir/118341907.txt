state - of - the - art microfabricated ion traps for quantum information research are approaching nearly one hundred control electrodes . we report here on the development and testing of a new architecture for microfabricated ion traps , built around ball - grid array ( bga ) connections , that is suitable for increasingly complex trap designs . in the bga trap , through - substrate vias bring electrical signals from the back side of the trap die to the surface trap structure on the top side . gold - ball bump bonds connect the back side of the trap die to an interposer for signal routing from the carrier . trench capacitors fabricated into the trap die replace area - intensive surface or edge capacitors . wirebonds in the bga architecture are moved to the interposer . these last two features allow the trap die to be reduced to only the area required to produce trapping fields . the smaller trap dimensions allow tight focusing of an addressing laser beam for fast single - qubit rotations . performance of the bga trap as characterized with $ ^{40}$ca$^+$ ions is comparable to previous surface - electrode traps in terms of ion heating rate , mode frequency stability , and storage lifetime . we demonstrate two - qubit entanglement operations with $ ^{171}$yb$^+$ ions in a second bga trap .
