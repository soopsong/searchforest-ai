setups in which a system alice emits field quanta which a system bob receives are prototypical for wireless communication and have been extensively studied . in the most basic setup , alice and bob are modelled as unruh - dewitt detectors for scalar quanta and the only noise in their communication is due to quantum fluctuations . for this basic setup we here construct the corresponding information - theoretic quantum channel . we calculate the classical channel capacity as a function of the spacetime separation and we confirm that the classical as well as the quantum channel capacity are strictly zero for spacelike separations . we show that this channel can be used to entangle alice and bob instantaneously . alice and bob are shown to extract this entanglement from the vacuum through a casimir - polder effect .
