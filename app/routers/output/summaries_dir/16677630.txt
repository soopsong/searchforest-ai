we present a tutorial on the properties of the new ideal circuit element , a memristor . by definition , a memristor m relates the charge q and the magnetic flux $ \phi$ in a circuit , and complements a resistor r , a capacitor c , and an inductor l as an ingredient of ideal electrical circuits . the properties of these three elements and their circuits are a part of the standard curricula . the existence of the memristor as the fourth ideal circuit element was predicted in 1971 based on symmetry arguments , but was clearly experimentally demonstrated just this year . we present the properties of a single memristor , memristors in series and parallel , as well as ideal memristor - capacitor ( mc ) , memristor - inductor ( ml ) , and memristor - capacitor - inductor ( mcl ) circuits . we find that the memristor has hysteretic current - voltage characteristics . we show that the ideal mc ( ml ) circuit undergoes non - exponential charge ( current ) decay with two time - scales , and that by switching the polarity of the capacitor , an ideal mcl circuit can be tuned from overdamped to underdamped . we present simple models which show that these unusual properties are closely related to the memristor 's internal dynamics . this tutorial complements the pedagogy of ideal circuit elements ( r , c , and l ) and the properties of their circuits .
