i report a theoretical study of collective coherent quantum - mechanical oscillations in disordered superconducting quantum metamaterials ( sqms ) , i.e artificially fabricated arrays of interacting qubits ( two - levels system ) . an unavoidable disorder in qubits parameters results in a substantial spread of qubits frequencies , and in the absence of electromagnetic interaction between qubits these individual quantum - mechanical oscillations of single qubits manifest themselves by a large number of small resonant drops in the frequency dependent transmission of electromagnetic waves propagating through disordered sqm , $ d(\omega)$. we show that even a weak electromagnetic interaction between adjacent qubits can overcome the disorder and establish completely or partially \emph{synchronized } quantum - mechanical dynamic state in the disordered sqm . in such a state a large amount of qubits displays the collective quantum mechanical oscillations , and this collective behavior manifests itself by a few giant resonant drops in the $ d(\omega)$ dependence . the size of a system $ r_0 $ showing the collective ( synchronized ) quantum - mechanical behavior is determined in the one - dimensional sqms as $ r_0 \simeq a [ k/\delta \delta]^2 $ , where $ k$ , $ \delta \delta$ , $ a$ are the energy of nearest - neighbor interaction , the spread of qubits energy splitting , and the distance between qubits , accordingly . we show that this phenomenon has an origin in the anderson localization of spinon - type excitations arising in the sqm . our analysis is also in a good accord with recent experiments on the electrodynamics of the disordered 1d sqms .
