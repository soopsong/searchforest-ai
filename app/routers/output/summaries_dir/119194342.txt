quantum walk has played an important role in development of quantum algorithms and protocols for quantum simulations . the speedup observed in quantum walk algorithms is attributed to quantum interference of spreading wave packet in position space . similarly , localization in quantum walk due to disorder is also attributed to quantum interference effect . therefore , it is intriguing to have a closer look and understand the way quantum interference manifests in different forms of quantum walk dynamics . here we will use interference measure to quantify the interference in position space and coin space , together and independently . this interference measure helps us to differentiate localisation seen in quantum walks due to different forms of disorder and topological effects . we also shown that the interference measure in the coin space alone can serve as an indicator of the spatially localized quantum state . comparing the result of interference and correlated coherence with the entanglement dynamics we show that all the intricate features of entanglement is captured by correlated coherence . this will give us a better understanding of role of quantum interference in quantum dynamics and its effect on entanglement . with the control over quantum walk dynamics and quantum interference , exploring the possibility of using interference as resource will be of immediate interest .
