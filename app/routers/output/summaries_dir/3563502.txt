single - photon sources based on optical parametric processes have been used extensively for quantum information applications due to their flexibility , room - temperature operation and potential for photonic integration . however , the intrinsically probabilistic nature of these sources is a major limitation for realizing large - scale quantum networks . active feedforward switching of photons from multiple probabilistic sources is a promising approach that can be used to build a deterministic source . however , previous implementations of this approach that utilize spatial and/or temporal multiplexing suffer from rapidly increasing switching losses when scaled to a large number of modes . here , we break this limitation via frequency multiplexing in which the switching losses remain fixed irrespective of the number of modes . we use the third - order nonlinear process of bragg scattering four - wave mixing as an efficient ultra - low noise frequency switch and demonstrate multiplexing of three frequency modes . we achieve a record generation rate of $ 4.6\times10 ^ 4 $ multiplexed photons per second with an ultra - low $ g^{2}(0)$ = 0.07 , indicating high single - photon purity . our scalable , all - fiber multiplexing system has a total loss of just 1.3 db independent of the number of multiplexed modes , such that the 4.8 db enhancement from multiplexing three frequency modes markedly overcomes switching loss . our approach offers a highly promising path to creating a deterministic photon source that can be integrated on a chip - based platform .
