a recently discovered classical - quantum correspondence ( cqc ) maps certain quantum problems to corresponding classical problems . we illustrate the cqc for a quantum scalar field in the gravitational background of a collapsing spherical shell . by truncating the problem to a small set of variables , we show how the cqc can yield hawking radiation as well as the slow down of the collapse due to radiation backreaction .
