we present fabrication and characterization procedures of devices for circuit quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) . we have made 3 ghz cavities with quality factors in the range 10 ^ 4 - -10 ^ 6 , which allow access to the strong coupling regime of cqed . the cavities are transmission line resonators made by photolithography . they are coupled to the input and output ports via gap capacitors . an al - based cooper pair box is made by ebeam lithography and dolan bridge double - angle evaporation in superconducting resonators with high quality factor . an important issue is to characterize the quality factor of the resonators . we present an rf - characterization of superconducting resonators as a function of temperature and magnetic field . we have realized different versions of the system with different box - cavity couplings by using different dielectrics and by changing the box geometry . moreover , the cqed approach can be used as a diagnostic tool of qubit internal losses .
