we investigate the magnetic hysteresis of a superconducting microstrip resonator with a high edge barrier . we measure the magnetic hysteresis while either sweeping a magnetic field or tuning the edge barrier by high microwave current . we show that the magnetic hysteresis of such a device is qualitatively different from that of one without an edge barrier and can be understood based on the generalized critical - state model . in particular , we propose and demonstrate a simple and intuitive method that relies on a plot of the quality factor versus the resonance frequency for revealing the physical processes behind those hysteretic behaviors . based on this , we find that the interplay between the meisser current and vortex pinning is essential for understanding the magnetic hysteresis of such a device .
