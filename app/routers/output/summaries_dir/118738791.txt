we investigate the entanglement properties of thermal states of the harmonic lattice in one , two and three dimensions . we establish the value of the critical temperature for entanglement between neighbouring sites and give physical reasons . further sites are shown to be entangled only due to boundary effects . other forms of entanglement are addressed in the second part of the paper by using the energy as witness of entanglement . we close with a comprehensive diagram showing the different phases of entanglement versus complete separability and propose techniques to swap and tune entanglement experimentally .
