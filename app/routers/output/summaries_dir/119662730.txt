we provide a complete picture of contractivity of trace preserving positive maps with respect to $ p$-norms . we show that for $ p>1 $ contractivity holds in general if and only if the map is unital . when the domain is restricted to the traceless subspace of hermitian matrices , then contractivity is shown to hold in the case of qubits for arbitrary $ p\geq 1 $ and in the case of qutrits if and only if $ p=1,\infty$. in all non - contractive cases best possible bounds on the $ p$-norms are derived .
