role of quantum interference in the origin of higher - order nonclassical characteristics of radiation field has been probed vis - a - vis a discrete and a continuous superposition of coherent states . specifically , the possibilities of observing higher - order nonclassical properties ( e.g. , higher - order antibunching ( hoa ) , higher - order sub - poissonian photon statistics ( hosps ) , higher - order squeezing ( hos ) of hong - mandel type and hillery type ) have been investigated using a shifted symmetric cat state that reduces to yurke - stoler , even and odd coherent states at various limits . this shifted symmetric cat state which can be viewed as a discrete superposition of coherent states is found to show hoa and hosps . similarly , higher - order nonclassical properties of a one - dimensional continuous superposition of coherent states is also studied here . the investigation has revealed the existence of hos and hosps in the one - dimensional continuous superposition of coherent states studied here . effect of non - gaussianity inducing operations ( e.g. , photon addition and addition followed by subtraction ) on these superposition states have also been investigated . finally , some comparisons have been made between the higher - order nonclassical properties of discrete and continuous superposition of coherent states .
