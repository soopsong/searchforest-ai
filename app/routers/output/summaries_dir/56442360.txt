we report on the delay of optical pulses using electromagnetically induced transparency in an ensemble of cold atoms with an optical depth exceeding 500 . to identify the regimes in which four - wave mixing impacts on eit behaviour , we conduct the experiment in both rubidium 85 and rubidium 87 . comparison with theory shows excellent agreement in both isotopes . in rubidium 87 , negligible four - wave mixing was observed and we obtained one pulse - width of delay with 50 % efficiency . in rubidium 85 , four - wave - mixing contributes to the output . in this regime we achieve a delay - bandwidth product of 3.7 at 50 % efficiency , allowing temporally multimode delay , which we demonstrate by compressing two pulses into the memory medium .
