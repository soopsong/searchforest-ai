microring resonators are attractive for low - power frequency conversion via bragg - scattering four - wave - mixing due to their comb - like resonance spectrum . however , conversion efficiency is limited to 50 % due to the equal probability of up- and down - conversion . here , we demonstrate how two coupled microrings enable highly directional conversion between the spectral modes of one of the rings . an extinction between up- and down - conversion of more than 40 db is experimentally observed . based on this method , we propose a design for on - chip multiplexed single - photon sources that allow localized frequency modes to be converted into propagating continuous - mode photon wave packets using a single operation . the key is that frequency conversion works as a switch on both spatial and spectral degrees of freedom of photons if the microring is interferometrically coupled to a bus waveguide . our numerical results show 99 % conversion efficiency into a propagating mode with a wave packet having a 90 % overlap with a gaussian for a ratio between intrinsic and coupling quality factors of 400 .
