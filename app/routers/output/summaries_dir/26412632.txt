topological phases in frustrated quantum spin systems have fascinated researchers for decades . one of the earliest proposals for such a phase was the chiral spin liquid put forward by kalmeyer and laughlin in 1987 as the bosonic analogue of the fractional quantum hall effect . elusive for many years , recent times have finally seen a number of models that realize this phase . however , these models are somewhat artificial and unlikely to be found in realistic materials . here , we take an important step towards the goal of finding a chiral spin liquid in nature by examining a physically motivated model for a mott insulator on the kagome lattice with broken time - reversal symmetry . we first provide a theoretical justification for the emergent chiral spin liquid phase in terms of a network model perspective . we then present an unambiguous numerical identification and characterization of the universal topological properties of the phase , including ground state degeneracy , edge physics , and anyonic bulk excitations , by using a variety of powerful numerical probes , including the entanglement spectrum and modular transformations .
