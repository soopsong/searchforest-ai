we implement a quantum optimal control algorithm based on automatic differentiation and harness the acceleration afforded by graphics processing units ( gpus ) . automatic differentiation allows us to specify advanced optimization criteria and incorporate them in the optimization process with ease . we show that the use of gpus can speed up calculations by more than an order of magnitude . our strategy facilitates efficient numerical simulations on affordable desktop computers , and exploration of a host of optimization constraints and system parameters relevant to real - life experiments . we demonstrate optimization of quantum evolution based on fine - grained evaluation of performance at each intermediate time step , thus enabling more intricate control on the evolution path , suppression of departures from the truncated model subspace , as well as minimization of the physical time needed to perform high - fidelity state preparation and unitary gates .
