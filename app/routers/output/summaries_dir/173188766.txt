denote $ m_k$ the set of complex $ k$ by $ k$ matrices . we will analyze here quantum channels $ \phi_l$ of the following kind : given a measurable function $ l : m_k\to m_k$ and the measure $ \mu$ on $ m_k$ we define the linear operator $ \phi_l : m_k \to m_k$ , via the expression $ \rho \,\to\,\phi_l(\rho ) = \int_{m_k } l(v ) \rho l(v)^\dagger \ , \dm(v).$ a recent paper by t. benoist , m. fraas , y. pautrat , and c. pellegrini is our starting point . they considered the case where $ l$ was the identity . under some mild assumptions on the quantum channel $ \phi_l$ we analyze the eigenvalue property for $ \phi_l$ and we define entropy for such channel . for a fixed $ \mu$ ( the { \it a priori } measure ) and for a given an hamiltonian $ h : m_k \to m_k$ we present a variational principle of pressure ( associated to such $ h$ ) and relate it to the eigenvalue problem . we introduce the concept of gibbs channel . we will show that for a fixed $ \mu$ ( with more than one point in the support ) the set of $ l$ such that it is $ \phi$-erg ( and also irreducible ) for $ \mu$ is a generic set . we describe a related process $ x_n$ , $ n\in \mathbb{n}$ , taking values on the projective space $ p(\c^k)$ and analyze the question of existence of invariant probabilities . we also consider an associated process $ \rho_n$ , $ n\in \mathbb{n}$ , with values on $ d_k$ ( $ d_k$ is the set of density operators ) . via the barycenter we associate the invariant probabilities mentioned above with the density operator fixed for $ \phi_l$.
