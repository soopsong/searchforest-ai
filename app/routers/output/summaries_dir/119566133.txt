we study the dynamics of a class of hamiltonian systems with dissipation , coupled to noise , in a singular ( small mass ) limit . we derive the homogenized equation for the position degrees of freedom in the limit , including the presence of a { \em noise - induced drift } term . we prove convergence to the solution of the homogenized equation in probability and , under stronger assumptions , in an $ l^p$-norm . applications cover the overdamped limit of particle motion in a time - dependent electromagnetic field , on a manifold with time - dependent metric , and the dynamics of nuclear matter .
