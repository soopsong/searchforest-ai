this paper is concerned with quantum harmonic oscillators consisting of a quantum plant and a directly coupled coherent quantum observer . we employ discounted quadratic performance criteria in the form of exponentially weighted time averages of second - order moments of the system variables . a coherent quantum filtering ( cqf ) problem is formulated as the minimization of the discounted mean square of an estimation error , with which the dynamic variables of the observer approximate those of the plant . the cost functional also involves a quadratic penalty on the plant - observer coupling matrix in order to mitigate the back - action of the observer on the covariance dynamics of the plant . for the discounted mean square optimal cqf problem with penalized back - action , we establish first - order necessary conditions of optimality in the form of algebraic matrix equations . by using the hamiltonian structure of the heisenberg dynamics and related lie - algebraic techniques , we represent this set of equations in a more explicit form in the case of equally dimensioned plant and observer .
