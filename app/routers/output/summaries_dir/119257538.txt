we study the performance of composite pulses in the presence of time - varying control noise on a single qubit . these protocols , originally devised only to correct for static , systematic errors , are shown to be robust to time - dependent non - markovian noise in the control field up to frequencies as high as ~10 % of the rabi frequency . our study combines a generalized filter - function approach with asymptotic dc - limit calculations to give a simple analytic framework for error analysis applied to a number of composite - pulse sequences relevant to nuclear magnetic resonance as well as quantum information experiments . results include examination of recently introduced concatenated composite pulses and dynamically corrected gates , demonstrating equivalent first - order suppression of time - dependent fluctuations in amplitude and/or detuning , as appropriate for the sequence in question . our analytic results agree well with numerical simulations for realistic $ 1 / f$ noise spectra with a roll - off to $ 1 / f^2 $ , providing independent validation of our theoretical insights .
