cooled , low - loss nanomechanical resonators offer the prospect of directly observing the quantum dynamics of mesoscopic systems . however , the present state of the art requires cooling down to the millikelvin regime in order to observe quantum effects . here we present an active feedback strategy based on continuous observation of the resonator position for the purpose of obtaining these low temperatures . in addition , we apply this to an experimentally realizable configuration , where the position monitoring is carried out by a single - electron transistor . our estimates indicate that with current technology this technique is likely to bring the required low temperatures within reach .
