free - space optical communication links are promising channels for establishing secure quantum communication . here we study the transmission of nonclassical light through a turbulent atmospheric link under diverse weather conditions , including rain or haze . to include these effects , the theory of light transmission through atmospheric links in the elliptic - beam approximation presented by vasylyev et al . [ d. vasylyev et al . , phys . rev . lett . 117 , 090501 ( 2016 ) ; arxiv:1604.01373 ] is further generalized.it is demonstrated , with good agreement between theory and experiment , that low - intensity rain merely contributes additional deterministic losses , whereas haze also introduces additional beam deformations of the transmitted light . based on these results , we study theoretically the transmission of quadrature squeezing and gaussian entanglement under these weather conditions .
