a multilevel four - stroke engine where the thermalization stokes are generated by unitary collisions with bath particles is analyzed . our model is solvable even when the engine operates far from thermal equilibrium and in the strong system - bath coupling . necessary operation conditions for the heat machine to perform as an engine or a refrigerator are derived . we relate the work and efficiency of the device to local and non - local statistical properties of the baths ( purity , mutual coincidence etc . ) . in particular , we relate the clausius inequality to the symmetrized relative entropy of the baths ( jefferys divergence ) . other clausius - like inequalities are derived as well . finally , in the ultra - hot regime we optimize the work of the multilevel engine and obtain simpler forms for the work and efficiency .
