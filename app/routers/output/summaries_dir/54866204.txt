$ \mathcal{pt}$ symmetry , that is , a combined parity and time - reversal symmetry is a key milestone for non - hermite systems exhibiting entirely real eigenenergy . in the present work , motivated by a recent experiment , we study $ \mathcal{pt}$ symmetry of the time - evolution operator of non - unitary quantum walks . we present the explicit definition of $ \mathcal{pt}$ symmetry by employing a concept of symmetry time frames . we provide a necessary and sufficient condition so that the time - evolution operator of the non - unitary quantum walk retains $ \mathcal{pt}$ symmetry even when parameters of the model depend on position . it is also shown that there exist extra symmetries embedded in the time - evolution operator . applying these results , we clarify that the non - unitary quantum walk in the experiment does have $ \mathcal{pt}$ symmetry .
