spin qubits offer one of the most promising routes to the implementation of quantum computers . very recent results in semiconductor quantum dots show that electrically - controlled gating schemes are particularly well - suited for the realization of a universal set of quantum logical gates . scalability to a larger number of qubits , however , remains an issue for such semiconductor quantum dots . in contrast , a chemical bottom - up approach allows one to produce identical units in which localized spins represent the qubits . molecular magnetism has produced a wide range of systems with tailored properties , but molecules permitting electrical gating have been lacking . here we propose to use the polyoxometalate [ pmo12o40(vo)2]q- , where two localized spins-1/2 can be coupled through the electrons of the central core . via electrical manipulation of the molecular redox potential , the charge of the core can be changed . with this setup , two - qubit gates and qubit readout can be implemented .
