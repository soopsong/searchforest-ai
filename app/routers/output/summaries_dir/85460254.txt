we address the optimal estimation of quantum parameters , in the framework of local quantum estimation theory , for a massive scalar quantum field in the expanding robertson - walker universe exhibiting lorentz invariance violation ( liv ) . the information about the history of the expanding spacetime in the presence of liv can be extracted by taking measurements on the entangled state of particle modes . we find that , in the estimation of cosmological parameters , the ultimate bounds to the precision of the lorentz - invariant massive scalar field can be improved due to the effects of liv under some appropriate conditions . we also show that , in the lorentz - invariant massive scalar field and massless scalar field due to liv backgrounds , the optimal precision can be achieved by choosing the particles with some suitable liv , cosmological and field parameters . moreover , in the estimation of liv parameter during the spacetime expansion , we prove that the appropriate momentum mode of field particles and larger cosmological parameters can provide us a better precision . particularly , the optimal precision of the parameters estimation can be obtained by performing projective measurements implemented by the projectors onto the eigenvectors of specific probe states .
