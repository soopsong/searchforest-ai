superresolution , extraordinary transmission , total absorption , and localization of electromagnetic waves are currently attracting growing attention . these phenomena are related to different physical objects and are usually studied within the context of different , sometimes rather sophisticated , physical approaches . remarkably , all these seemingly unrelated phenomena owe their origin to the same underlying physical mechanism - wave interaction with an open resonator . here we show that it is possible to describe all of these effects in a unified way , mapping each system onto a simple resonator model . such description provides a thorough understanding of the phenomena , explains all the main features of their complex behaviour , and enables to control the system via the resonator parameters : eigenfrequencies , q - factors , and coupling coefficients .
