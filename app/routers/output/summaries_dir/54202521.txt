in this technical note , we study the mean square stability based analysis of stochastic continuous - time linear networked systems . the stochastic uncertainty is assumed to enter multiplicatively in system dynamics through input and output channels of the plant . necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square exponential stability are expressed in terms of the input â€“ output property of deterministic or nominal system dynamics captured by the mean square system norm and variance of channel uncertainty . the stability results can also be interpreted as a small - gain theorem for continuous - time stochastic systems . linear matrix inequalities based optimization formulation is provided for the computation of mean square system norm for the stability analysis . for a special case of single - input channel uncertainty , we also prove a fundamental limitation result that arises in the mean square exponential stabilization of the continuous - time linear system . overall , the contributions in this technical note generalize the existing results on stability analysis from discrete - time linear systems to continuous - time linear systems with multiplicative uncertainty . simulation results are presented for western system coordinating council 9-bus power system to demonstrate the application of the developed framework .
