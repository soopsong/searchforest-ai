we present an analysis of the entangling quantum kicked top focusing on the few qubit case and the initial condition dependence of the time - averaged entanglement $ s_q$ for spin - coherent states . we show a very strong connection between the classical phase space and the initial condition dependence of $ s_q$ even for the extreme case of two spin-$1/2 $ qubits . this correlation is not related directly to chaos in the classical dynamics . we introduce a measure of the behavior of a classical trajectory which correlates far better with the entanglement and show that the maps of classical and quantum initial - condition dependence are both organized around the symmetry points of the hamiltonian . we also show clear ( quasi-)periodicity in entanglement as a function of number of kicks and of kick strength .
