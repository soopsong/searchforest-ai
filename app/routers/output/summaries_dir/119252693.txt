the problem of model discriminability and parameter identifiability for dephasing two - level systems subject to hamiltonian control is studied . analytic solutions of the bloch equations are used to derive explicit expressions for observables as functions of time for different models . this information is used to give criteria for model discrimination and parameter estimation based on simple experimental paradigms .
