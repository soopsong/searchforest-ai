we investigate analytically and numerically the nonstationary circuit qed setup in which $ n$ independent qubits interact with a single mode of the electromagnetic field confined in a resonator . we consider the harmonic time modulation of some parameter ( atomic transition frequency or the atom - field coupling strength ) and derive the unitary dynamics up to the second order in the modulation depth for $ n=1 $ and $ n\gg 1$. it is shown that all the resonant phenomena that occur for modulation frequencies $ \sim 2\omega _ { 0}$ ( where $ \omega _ { 0}$ is the cavity frequency ) also occur for the halved frequencies . however , in the latter case the associated transition rates are significantly smaller and the modulation of the coupling strength is less effective . the transition rates are evaluated explicitly and the prospects of employing the second - order resonances in the phenomena related to the dynamical casimir effect are examined .
