there is a common understanding in quantum optics that nonclassical states of light are states that do not have a positive semidefinite and sufficiently regular glauber - sudarshan $ p$ function . almost all known nonclassical states have $ p$ functions that are highly irregular which makes working with them difficult and direct experimental reconstruction impossible . here we introduce classes of nonclassical states with regular , non - positive - definite $ p$ functions . they are constructed by"puncturing"regular smooth positive $ p$ functions with negative dirac - delta peaks , or other sufficiently narrow smooth negative functions . we determine the parameter ranges for which such punctures are possible without losing the positivity of the state , as well as the regimes yielding antibunching of light . finally , we propose some possible experimental realizations of such states .
