the quality factor ( q ) , mode volume ( veff ) , and room - temperature lasing threshold of microdisk cavities with embedded quantum dots ( qds ) are investigated . finite element method simulations of standing wave modes within the microdisk reveal that veff can be as small as 2(lambda / n)^3 while maintaining radiation - limited qs in excess of 10 ^ 5 . microdisks of diameter d=2 microns are fabricated in an algaas material containing a single layer of inas qds with peak emission at lambda = 1317 nm . for devices with veff ~2 ( lambda / n)^3 , qs as high as 1.2 x 10 ^ 5 are measured passively in the 1.4 micron band , using an optical fiber taper waveguide . optical pumping yields laser emission in the 1.3 micron band , with room temperature , continuous - wave thresholds as low as 1 microwatt of absorbed pump power . out - coupling of the laser emission is also shown to be significantly enhanced through the use of optical fiber tapers , with laser differential efficiency as high as xi~16 % and out - coupling efficiency in excess of 28 % .
