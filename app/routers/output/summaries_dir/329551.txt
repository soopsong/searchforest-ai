given a completely positive ( cp ) map $ t$ , there is a theorem of the radon - nikodym type [ w.b . arveson , acta math . { \bf 123 } , 141 ( 1969 ) ; v.p . belavkin and p. staszewski , rep . math . phys . { \bf 24 } , 49 ( 1986 ) ] that completely characterizes all cp maps $ s$ such that $ t - s$ is also a cp map . this theorem is reviewed , and several alternative formulations are given along the way . we then use the radon - nikodym formalism to study the structure of order intervals of quantum operations , as well as a certain one - to - one correspondence between cp maps and positive operators , already fruitfully exploited in many quantum information - theoretic treatments . we also comment on how the radon - nikodym theorem can be used to derive norm estimates for differences of cp maps in general , and of quantum operations in particular .
