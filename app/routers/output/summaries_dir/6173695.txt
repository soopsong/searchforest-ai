while it seems possible that quantum computers may allow for algorithms offering a computational speed - up over classical algorithms for some problems , the issue is poorly understood . we explore this computational speed - up by investigating the ability to de - quantise quantum algorithms into classical simulations of the algorithms which are as efficient in both time and space as the original quantum algorithms . the process of de - quantisation helps formulate conditions to determine if a quantum algorithm provides a real speed - up over classical algorithms . these conditions can be used to develop new quantum algorithms more effectively ( by avoiding features that could allow the algorithm to be efficiently classically simulated ) , as well as providing the potential to create new classical algorithms ( by using features which have proved valuable for quantum algorithms ) . results on many different methods of de - quantisations are presented , as well as a general formal definition of de - quantisation . de - quantisations employing higher - dimensional classical bits , as well as those using matrix - simulations , put emphasis on entanglement in quantum algorithms ; a key result is that any algorithm in which the entanglement is bounded is de - quantisable . these methods are contrasted with the stabiliser formalism de - quantisations due to the gottesman - knill theorem , as well as those which take advantage of the topology of the circuit for a quantum algorithm . the benefits of the different methods are contrasted , and the importance of a range of techniques is emphasised . we further discuss some features of quantum algorithms which current de - quantisation methods do not cover .
