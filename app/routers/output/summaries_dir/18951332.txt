with our all - atomic squeezing and filtering setup , we demonstrate control over the noise amplitudes and manipulation of the frequency - dependent squeezing angle of a squeezed vacuum quantum state by passing it through an atomic medium with electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) . we generate low sideband frequency squeezed vacuum using the polarization self - rotation effect in a hot rb vapor cell , and input it into a second atomic vapor subject to eit conditions . we use the frequency - dependent absorption of the eit window to demonstrate an example of squeeze amplitude attenuation and squeeze angle rotation of the quantum noise quadratures of the squeezed probe . these studies have implications for quantum memory and storage as well as gravitational wave interferometric detectors .
