we theoretically analyze the optical and optomechanical nonlinearity present in a hybrid system consisting of a quantum dot(qd ) coupled to an optomechanical cavity in the presence of a nonlinear kerr medium , and show that this hybrid system can be used as an all optical switch . a high degree of control and tunability via the qd - cavity coupling strength , the kerr and the optomechanical nonlinearity over the bistable behavior shown by the mean intracavity optical field and the power transmission of the weak probe field can be achieved.the results obtained in this investigation has the potential to be used for designing efficient all - optical switch and high sensitive sensors for use in telecom systems .
