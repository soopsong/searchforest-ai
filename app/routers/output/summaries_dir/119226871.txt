we address the problem of assessing the coherent character of physical evolution . we take the quantum zeno effect ( qze ) as a characteristic trait of quantum dynamics , and derive relations among transfer rates as a function of the strength of a measurement . these relations support the intuition that only quantum dynamics is susceptible to qze . with the derived bounds on the magnitude of coherent dynamics , we propose an experimentally accessible coherence witness . our results have potential application in assessing coherence of quantum transport in biological and other complex many - body systems .
