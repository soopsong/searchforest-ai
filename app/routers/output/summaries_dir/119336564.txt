we consider a bipartite quantum system s = ab such that the part a is isolated from the environment e and only the part b interacts with e. under such circumstances , entanglement of the system may experience decreases and increases , during the evolution of the system . here , we show that the entanglement of the system can exceed its initial value , under such local interaction , even though , at the initial moment , there is no entanglement in the environment and the system and the environment are only classically correlated . the case which is studied in this paper possesses another interesting feature too : the reduced dynamics of the system can be modeled as a completely positive map . in addition , we introduce the concept of inaccessible entanglement to explain why entanglement can exceed its initial value , under local interactions , in open quantum systems .
