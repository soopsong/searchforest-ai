we explore the dynamics of entanglement in classically chaotic systems by considering a multiqubit system that behaves collectively as a spin system obeying the dynamics of the quantum kicked top . in the classical limit , the kicked top exhibits both regular and chaotic dynamics depending on the strength of the chaoticity parameter $ \kappa$ in the hamiltonian . we show that the entanglement of the multiqubit system , considered for both bipartite and pairwise entanglement , yields a signature of quantum chaos . whereas bipartite entanglement is enhanced in the chaotic region , pairwise entanglement is suppressed . furthermore , we define a time - averaged entangling power and show that this entangling power changes markedly as $ \kappa$ moves the system from being predominantly regular to being predominantly chaotic , thus sharply identifying the edge of chaos . when this entangling power is averaged over initial states , it yields a signature of global chaos . the qualitative behavior of this global entangling power is similar to that of the classical lyapunov exponent .
