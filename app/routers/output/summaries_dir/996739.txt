this paper presents a sampled - data approach for the robust control of a single qubit ( quantum bit ) . the required robustness is defined using a sliding mode domain and the control law is designed offline and then utilized online with a single qubit having bounded uncertainties . two classes of uncertainties are considered involving the system hamiltonian and the coupling strength of the system - environment interaction . four cases are analyzed in detail including without decoherence , with amplitude damping decoherence , phase damping decoherence and depolarizing decoherence . sampling periods are specifically designed for these cases to guarantee the required robustness . two sufficient conditions are presented for guiding the design of unitary control for the cases without decoherence and with amplitude damping decoherence . the proposed approach has potential applications in quantum error - correction and in constructing robust quantum gates .
