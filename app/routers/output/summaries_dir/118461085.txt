tremendous efforts have been paid for realization of fault - tolerant quantum computation so far . however , preexisting fault - tolerant schemes assume that a lot of qubits live together in a single quantum system , which is incompatible with actual situations of experiment . here we propose a novel architecture for practically scalable quantum computation , where quantum computation is distributed over small - size ( four - qubit ) local systems , which are connected by quantum channels . we show that the proposed architecture works even with the error probability 0.1 % of local operations , which breaks through the consensus by one order of magnitude . furthermore , the fidelity of quantum channels can be very low $ \sim$ 0.7 , which substantially relaxes the difficulty of scaling - up the architecture . all key elements and their accuracy required for the present architecture are within reach of current technology . the present architecture allows us to achieve efficient scaling of quantum computer , as has been achieved in today 's classical computer .
