we discuss particle entanglement in systems of indistinguishable bosons and fermions , in finite hilbert spaces , with focus on operational measures of quantum correlations . we show how to use von neumann entropy , negativity and entanglement witnesses in these cases , proving interesting relations . we obtain analytic expressions to quantify quantum correlations in homogeneous d - dimensional hamiltonian models with certain symmetries .
