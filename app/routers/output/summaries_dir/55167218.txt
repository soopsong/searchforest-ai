a trapped atom interferometer involving state - selective adiabatic potentials with two microwave frequencies on a chip is proposed . we show that this configuration provides a way to achieve a high degree of symmetry between the two arms of the interferometer , which is necessary for coherent splitting and recombination of thermal ( i.e. non - condensed ) atoms . the resulting interferometer holds promise to achieve high contrast and long coherence time , while avoiding the mean - field interaction issues of interferometers based on trapped bose - einstein condenstates .
