the einstein - hilbert theory of gravity can be rephrased by focusing on local conformal symmetry as an exact , but spontaneously broken symmetry of nature . the conformal component of the metric field is then treated as a dilaton field with only renormalizable interactions . this imposes constraints on the theory , which can also be viewed as demanding regularity of the action as the dilaton field variable tends to 0 . in other words , we have constraints on the small distance behaviour . our procedure appears to turn a black hole into a regular , topologically trivial soliton without singularities , horizons of firewalls , but many questions remain .
