we study how quantum systems that propagate in the spacetime of a rotating planet are affected by the curved background . spacetime curvature affects wavepackets of photons propagating from earth to a satellite , and the changes in the wavepacket encode the parameters of the spacetime . this allows us to evaluate quantitatively how quantum communications are affected by the curved spacetime background of the earth and to achieve precise measurements of earth 's schwarzschild radius and equatorial angular velocity . we then provide a comparison with the state of the art in parameter estimation obtained through classical means . satellite to satellite communications and future directions are also discussed .
