the mathematical theory of quantum feedback networks has recently been developed for general open quantum dynamical systems interacting with bosonic input fields . in this article we show , for the special case of linear dynamical systems markovian systems with instantaneous feedback connections , that the transfer functions can be deduced and agree with the algebraic rules obtained in the nonlinear case . using these rules , we derive the the transfer functions for linear quantum systems in series , in cascade , and in feedback arrangements mediated by beam splitter devices .
