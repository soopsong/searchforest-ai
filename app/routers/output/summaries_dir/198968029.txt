we study the quasiprobability representation of quantum light , as introduced by glauber and sudarshan , for the unified characterization of quantum phenomena . we begin with reviewing the past and current impact of this technique . regularization and convolution methods are specifically considered as they are accessible in experiments . we further discuss more general quantum systems for which the concept of negative probabilities can be generalized , being highly relevant for quantum information science . for analyzing quantum superpositions , we apply recently developed approaches to visualize quantum coherence of states via negative quasiprobability representations , including regularized quasiprobabilities for light and more general quantum correlated systems .
