the purpose of this paper is to describe the numerical solution of the hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) for an optimal control problem for quantum spin systems . this hjb equation is a first order nonlinear partial differential equation defined on a lie group . we employ recent extensions of the theory of viscosity solutions from euclidean space to riemannian manifolds to interpret possibly non - differentiable solutions to this equation . results from differential topology on the triangulation of manifolds are then used to develop a finite difference approximation method , which is shown to converge using viscosity solution techniques . an example is provided to illustrate the method .
