we present an effective operator formalism for open quantum systems . employing perturbation theory and adiabatic elimination of excited states for a weakly driven system , we derive an effective master equation which reduces the evolution to the ground - state dynamics . the effective evolution involves a single effective hamiltonian and one effective lindblad operator for each naturally occurring decay process . simple expressions are derived for the effective operators which can be directly applied to reach effective equations of motion for the ground states . we compare our method with the hitherto existing concepts for effective interactions and present physical examples for the application of our formalism , including dissipative state preparation by engineered decay processes .
