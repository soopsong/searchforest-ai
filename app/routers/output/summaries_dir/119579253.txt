we study quantum many - body states of immanons , hypothetical particles that obey an exchange symmetry defined for more than two participating particles . immanons thereby generalize bosons and fermions , which are defined by their behavior under pairwise symmetric and anti - symmetric exchange processes . the scalar product of two many - body states with fermionic , bosonic or generalized exchange symmetry becomes the determinant , permanent or immanant of the matrix containing all mutual scalar products of the occupied single - particle states . as a measurable consequence , immanons are shown to obey a partial pauli principle that forbids the multiple occupation of single - particle states above a certain threshold . the tendency to favor or oppose multiple occupation of single - particle modes , i.e. the degree of bunching , is the determinant , permanent or immanant of a hermitian positive semi - definite matrix . we exploit this identity to devise a gedankenexperiment that corroborates the permanental dominance conjecture .
