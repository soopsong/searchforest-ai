while a couple of impressive quantum technologies have been proposed , they have several intrinsic limitations which must be considered by circuit designers to produce realizable circuits . limited interaction distance between gate qubits is one of the most common limitations . in this paper , we suggest extensions of the existing synthesis flow aimed to realize circuits for quantum architectures with linear nearest neighbor ( lnn ) interaction . to this end , a template matching optimization , an exact synthesis approach , and two reordering strategies are introduced . the proposed methods are combined as an integrated synthesis flow . experiments show that by using the suggested flow , quantum cost can be improved by more than 50 % on average .
