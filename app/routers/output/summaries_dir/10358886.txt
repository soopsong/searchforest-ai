in this book chapter , we provide a tutorial introduction to one - way quantum computation and many of the techniques one can use to understand it . the techniques which are described include the stabilizer formalism and the logical heisenberg picture . we highlight ways in which it is useful to understand one - way computation beyond simple equivalence with the quantum circuit model . we briefly review current proposals of implementations and experimental progress and summarize some recent related theoretical developments . although the chapter is primarily didactic in focus , we include a number of new methods and observations . these include : a simpler and more compact formulation of one - way quantum computation in the stabilizer formalism ; a new way of implementing unitaries diagonal in the computational basis ; new results on the family of operations which may be implemented in a single round of measurements ; a method for constructing compact one - way patterns by decomposing unitaries in terms of diagonal unitaries and clifford group transformations .
