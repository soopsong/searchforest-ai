cosmology in extended theories of gravity is considered assuming the palatini variational principle , for which the metric and connection are independent variables . the field equations are derived to linear order in perturbations about the homogeneous and isotropic but possibly spatially curved background . the results are presented in a unified form applicable to a broad class of gravity theories allowing arbitrary scalar - tensor couplings and nonlinear dependence on the ricci scalar in the gravitational action . the gauge - ready formalism exploited here makes it possible to obtain the equations immediately in any of the commonly used gauges . of the three type of perturbations , the main attention is on the scalar modes responsible for the cosmic large - scale structure . evolution equations are derived for perturbations in a late universe filled with cold dark matter and accelerated by curvature corrections . such corrections are found to induce effective pressure gradients which are problematical in the formation of large - scale structure . this is demonstrated by analytic solutions in a particular case . a physical equivalence between scalar - tensor theories in metric and in palatini formalisms is pointed out .
