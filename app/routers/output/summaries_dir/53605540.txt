circular rydberg states with $ n=70 $ have been prepared in helium using a modified version of the crossed - fields method . this approach to the preparation of high-$n$ circular rydberg states overcomes limitations of the standard crossed - fields method which arise at this , and higher , values of $ n$. the experiments were performed with atoms traveling in pulsed supersonic beams that were initially laser photoexcited from the metastable 1s2s$\,^3$s$_1 $ level to the 1s73s$\,^3$s$_1 $ level by resonance - enhanced two - color two - photon excitation in a magnetic field of 16.154 g. these excited atoms were then polarized using a perpendicular electric field of 0.844~v / cm , and transferred by a pulse of microwave radiation to the state that , when adiabatically depolarized , evolves into the $ n=70 $ circular state in zero electric field . the excited atoms were detected by state - selective electric field ionization . each step of the circular state preparation process was validated by comparison with the calculated atomic energy level structure in the perpendicular electric and magnetic fields used . of the atoms initially excited to the 1s73s$\,^3$s$_1 $ level , $ \sim80$\% were transferred to the $ n=70 $ circular state . at these high values of $ n$ , $ \delta n = 1 $ circular - to - circular rydberg state transitions occur at frequencies below 20 ghz . consequently , atoms in these states , and the circular state preparation process presented here , are well suited to hybrid cavity qed experiments with rydberg atoms and superconducting microwave circuits .
