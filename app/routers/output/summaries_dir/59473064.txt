with rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , we show in this paper that exciton transmission in a one - dimensional two - level molecule chain embedded in a cavity can be enhanced or suppressed by strong cavity - chain couplings . this exciton transmission is closely related to the number of molecules and the distribution of molecular exciton energy . in addition , we propose a proposal to enhance the exciton transmission by quantum - jump - based feedback . these results may find applications in experiments of exciton transmission in organic materials .
