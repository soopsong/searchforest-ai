it is well known that the notions of spatial locality are often lost in quantum systems with long - range interactions , as exhibited by the emergence of phases with exotic long - range order and faster propagation of quantum correlations . we demonstrate here that such induced ` ` quasinonlocal"effects do not necessarily translate to growth of global entanglement in the quantum system . by investigating the ground and quenched states of the variable - range , spin-1/2 heisenberg hamiltonian , we observe that the genuine multiparty entanglement in the system can either increase or counterintuitively diminish with a growing range of interactions . the behavior is reflective of the underlying phase structure of the quantum system and provides key insights for generation of multipartite entanglement in experimental atomic , molecular , and optical physics where such variable - range interactions have been implemented .
