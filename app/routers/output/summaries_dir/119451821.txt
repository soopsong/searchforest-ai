in the paper , we employ a wavefunction approach to investigate the evolution of a two - photon wave packet propagating in a one - dimensional waveguide coupled to the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) system . we derive and solve , both analytically and numerically , a set of equations of motion governing the quantum state of the system . that allows us to provide real - time analysis of the evolution of the wave packet two - photon joint spectrum ( 2pjs ) and the excitation dynamics of the jc system in the course of its interaction with the two - photon pulse . we demonstrate that the 2pjs and the spectrum of the wave packet scattered from the jc system experience transformation for nonzero atom - cavity couplings . moreover , using schmidt decomposition , we show that the scattered photons feature frequency entanglement contrary to the incident ones which are not entangled .
