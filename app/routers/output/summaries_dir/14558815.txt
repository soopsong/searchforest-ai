homology is a tool in topological data analysis which measures the shape of the data . in many cases , these measurements translate into new insights which are not available by other means . to compute homology , we rely on mathematical constructions which scale exponentially with the size of the data . therefore , for large point clouds , the computation is infeasible using classical computers . in this paper , we present a quantum annealing pipeline for computation of homology of large point clouds . the pipeline takes as input a graph approximating the given point cloud . it uses quantum annealing to compute a clique covering of the graph and then uses this cover to construct a mayer - vietoris complex . the pipeline terminates by performing a simplified homology computation of the mayer - vietoris complex . we have introduced three different clique coverings and their quantum annealing formulation . our pipeline scales polynomially in the size of the data , once the covering step is solved . to prove correctness of our algorithm , we have also included tests using d - wave 2x quantum processor .
