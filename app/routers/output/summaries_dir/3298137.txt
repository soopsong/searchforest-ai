we define the entanglement - gradient routing scheme for quantum repeater networks . the routing framework fuses the fundamentals of swarm intelligence and quantum shannon theory . swarm intelligence provides nature - inspired solutions for problem solving . motivated by models of social insect behavior , the routing is performed using parallel threads to determine the shortest path via the entanglement gradient coefficient , which describes the feasibility of the entangled links and paths of the network . the routing metrics are derived from the characteristics of entanglement transmission and relevant measures of entanglement distribution in quantum networks . the method allows a moderate complexity decentralized routing in quantum repeater networks . the results can be applied in experimental quantum networking , future quantum internet , and long - distance quantum communications .
