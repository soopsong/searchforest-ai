we consider the open quantum random walks on the crystal lattices and investigate the central limit theorems for the walks . on the integer lattices the open quantum random walks satisfy the central limit theorems as was shown by attal , { \it et al } . in this paper we prove the central limit theorems for the open quantum random walks on the crystal lattices . we then provide with some examples for the hexagonal lattices . we also develop the fourier analysis on the crystal lattices . this leads to construct the so called dual processes for the open quantum random walks . it amounts to get fourier transform of the probability densities , and it is very useful when we compute the characteristic functions of the walks . in this paper we construct the dual processes for the open quantum random walks on the crystal lattices providing with some examples .
