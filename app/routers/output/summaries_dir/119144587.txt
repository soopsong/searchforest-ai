in the study of open quantum systems modeled by a unitary evolution of a bipartite hilbert space , we address the question of which parts of the environment can be said to have a"classical action"on the system , in the sense of acting as a classical stochastic process . our method relies on the definition of the environment algebra , a relevant von neumann algebra of the environment . with this algebra we define the classical parts of the environment and prove a decomposition between a maximal classical part and a quantum part . then we investigate what other information can be obtained via this algebra , which leads us to define a more pertinent algebra : the environment action algebra . this second algebra is linked to the minimal stinespring representations induced by the unitary evolution on the system . finally in finite dimension we give a characterization of both algebras in terms of the spectrum of a certain completely positive map acting on the states of the environment .
