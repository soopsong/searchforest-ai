we present an object - oriented python library for computation of properties of highly - excited rydberg states of alkali atoms . these include single - body effects such as dipole matrix elements , excited - state lifetimes ( radiative and black - body limited ) and stark maps of atoms in external electric fields , as well as two - atom interaction potentials accounting for dipole and quadrupole coupling effects valid at both long and short range for arbitrary placement of the atomic dipoles . the package is cross - referenced to precise measurements of atomic energy levels and features extensive documentation to facilitate rapid upgrade or expansion by users . this library has direct application in the field of quantum information and quantum optics which exploit the strong rydberg dipolar interactions for two - qubit gates , robust atom - light interfaces and simulating quantum many - body physics , as well as the field of metrology using rydberg atoms as precise microwave electrometers .
