recently there were many proposals on device - independent ( di ) quantum key distribution protocol whose security is based on the violation of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt inequality . however , as a statistical law , a certain extent of fluctuation has to be allowed . we show that the eavesdropper can make use of this property to obtain a remarkable part of the secret key by replacing some of the di nonlocal boxes with local ones . on the contrary , the same cheating strategy does not apply to the device - dependent ( dd ) version of the protocol . thus such kind of di protocol is less secure than its dd counterpart .
