we study representations of positive definite kernels $ k$ in a general setting , but with view to applications to harmonic analysis , to metric geometry , and to realizations of certain stochastic processes . our initial results are stated for the most general given positive definite kernel , but are then subsequently specialized to the above mentioned applications . given a positive definite kernel $ k$ on $ s\times s$ where $ s$ is a fixed set , we first study families of factorizations of $ k$. by a factorization ( or representation ) we mean a probability space $ \left(b,\mu\right)$ and an associated stochastic process indexed by $ s$ which has $ k$ as its covariance kernel . for each realization we identify a co - isometric transform from $ l^{2}\left(\mu\right)$ onto $ \mathscr{h}\left(k\right)$ , where $ \mathscr{h}\left(k\right)$ denotes the reproducing kernel hilbert space of $ k$. in some cases , this entails a certain renormalization of $ k$. our emphasis is on such realizations which are minimal in a sense we make precise . by minimal we mean roughly that $ b$ may be realized as a certain $ k$-boundary of the given set $ s$. we prove existence of minimal realizations in a general setting .
