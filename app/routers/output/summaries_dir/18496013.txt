the spatial search problem consists in minimizing the number of steps required to find a given site in a network , under the restriction that only oracle queries or translations to neighboring sites are allowed . in this paper , a quantum algorithm for the spatial search problem on a honeycomb lattice with $ n$ sites and torus - like boundary conditions . the search algorithm is based on a modified quantum walk on a hexagonal lattice and the general framework proposed by ambainis , kempe and rivosh is used to show that the time complexity of this quantum search algorithm is $ o(\sqrt{n \log n})$.
