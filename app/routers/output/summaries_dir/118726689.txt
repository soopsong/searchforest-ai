uhrig 's dynamical decoupling pulse sequence has emerged as one universal and highly promising approach to decoherence suppression . so far both the theoretical and experimental studies have examined single - qubit decoherence only . this work extends uhrig 's universal dynamical decoupling from one - qubit to two - qubit systems and even to general multi - level quantum systems . in particular , we show that by designing appropriate control hamiltonians for a two - qubit or a multi - level system , uhrig 's pulse sequence can also preserve a generalized quantum coherence measure to the order of $ 1+o(t^{n+1})$ , with only $ n$ pulses . our results lead to a very useful scheme for efficiently locking two - qubit entangled states . future important applications of uhrig 's pulse sequence in preserving the quantum coherence of multi - level quantum systems can also be anticipated .
