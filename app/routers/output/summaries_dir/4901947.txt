quantum information processing using atomic qubits requires narrow linewidth lasers with long - term stability for high fidelity coherent manipulation of rydberg states . in this paper , we report on the construction and characterization of three continuous - wave ( cw ) narrow linewidth lasers stabilized simultaneously to an ultra - high finesse fabry - perot cavity made of ultra - low expansion ( ule ) glass , with a tunable offset - lock frequency . one laser operates at 852~nm while the two locked lasers at 1018~nm are frequency doubled to 509~nm for excitation of $ ^{133}$cs atoms to rydberg states . the optical beatnote at 509~nm is measured to be 260(5)~hz . we present measurements of the offset between the atomic and cavity resonant frequencies using electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) for high - resolution spectroscopy on a cold atom cloud . the long - term stability is determined from repeated spectra over a period of 20 days yielding a linear frequency drift of $ \sim1$~hz / s .
