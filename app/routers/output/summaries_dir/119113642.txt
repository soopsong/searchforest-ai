we present a formalized perturbation theory for markovian open systems in the language of a generalized schrieffer - wolff ( sw ) transformation . a non - unitary rotation decouples the unper- turbed steady states from all fast degrees of freedom , in order to obtain an effective liouvillian , that reproduces the exact low excitation spectrum of the system . the transformation is derived in a constructive way , yielding a perturbative expansion of the effective liouville operator . the presented formalism realizes an adiabatic elimination of fast degrees of freedom to arbitrary orders in the perturbation . we exemplarily employ the sw formalism to two generic open systems and discuss general properties of the different orders of the perturbation .
