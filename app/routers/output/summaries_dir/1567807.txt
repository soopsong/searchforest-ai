the laws of thermodynamics put limits to the efficiencies of thermal machines . analogues of these laws are now established for quantum engines weakly and passively coupled to the environment providing a framework to find improvements to their performance . systems whose interaction with the environment is actively controlled do not fall in that framework . here we consider systems actively and locally coupled to the environment , evolving with a so - called boundary - driven lindblad equation . starting from a unitary description of the system plus the environment we simultaneously obtain the lindblad equation and the appropriate expressions for heat , work and entropy - production of the system extending the framework for the analysis of new , and some already proposed , quantum heat engines . we illustrate our findings in spin 1/2 chains and explain why an xx chain coupled in this way to a single heat bath relaxes to thermodynamic - equilibrium while and xy chain does not . additionally , we show that an xx chain coupled to a left and a right heat baths behaves as a quantum engine , a heater or refrigerator depending on the parameters , with efficiencies bounded by carnot efficiencies .
