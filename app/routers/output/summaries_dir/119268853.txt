the relationship between efficient quantum gate synthesis and control theory has been a topic of interest in the quantum control literature . motivated by this work , we describe in the present article how the dynamic programming technique from optimal control may be used for the optimal synthesis of quantum circuits . we demonstrate simulation results on an example system on su(2 ) , to obtain plots related to the gate complexity and sample paths for different logic gates .
