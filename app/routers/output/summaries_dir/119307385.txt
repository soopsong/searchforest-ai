in this paper , we consider the problem of steering a family of independent , structurally identical , finite - dimensional stochastic linear systems with variation in system parameters between initial and target states of interest by using an open - loop control function . our exploration of this class of control problems , which falls under the rising subject of ensemble control , is motivated by pulse design problems in quantum control . here we extend the concept of ensemble control to stochastic systems with additive diffusion and jump processes , which we model using brownian motion and poisson counters , respectively , and consider optimal steering problems . we derive a fredholm integral equation that is used to solve for the optimal control , which minimizes both the mean square error ( mse ) and the error in the mean of the terminal state . in addition , we present several example control problems for which optimal solutions are computed by numerically approximating the singular system of the associated fredholm operator . we use monte carlo simulations to illustrate the performance of the resulting controls . our work has immediate practical applications to the control of dynamical systems with additive noise and parameter dispersion , and also makes an important contribution to stochastic control theory .
