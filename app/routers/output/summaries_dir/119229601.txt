the contribution to the entanglement of an impurity attached to one end of a $ j - j_2-delta$ quantum spin chain ( s=1/2 ) is studied . two different measures of the impurity contribution to the entanglement have been proposed : the impurity - entanglement - entropy s_{imp } and the negativity n. the first , s_{imp } , is based on a subtractive procedure where the entanglement - entropy in the absence of the impurity is subtracted from results with the impurity present . the other , n , is the negativity of a part of the system separated from the impurity and the impurity itself . in this paper we compare the two measures and discuss similarities and differences between them . in the $ j - j_2-\delta$ model it is possible to perform very precise variational calculations close to the majumdar - ghosh - point ( j_2 = j / 2 and \delta = 0 ) where the system is gapped with a two - fold degenerate dimerized ground - state . we describe in detail how such calculations are done and how they can be used to calculate n as well as s_{imp } for any impurity - coupling j_k . we then study the complete cross - over in the impurity entanglement as j_k is varied between 0 and 1 close to the majumdar - ghosh - point . in particular we study the impurity entanglement when a staggered nearest - neighbour - interaction proportional to $ \delta$ is introduced . in this case , the two - fold degeneracy of the ground - state is lifted leading to a very rapid reduction in the impurity entanglement as $ \delta$ is increased .
