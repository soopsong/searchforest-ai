we discuss quantum information processing with trapped electrons . after recalling the operation principle of planar penning traps we sketch the experimental conditions to load , cool and detect single electrons . here we present a detailed investigation of a scalable scheme including feasibility studies and the analysis of all important elements , relevant for the experimental stage . on the theoretical side , we discuss different methods to couple electron qubits . we estimate the relevant qubit coherence times and draw implications for the experimental setting . a critical assessment of quantum information processing with trapped electrons is concluding the article .
