the qudit state for j = 3=2 with density matrix of the form corresponding to x - state of two - qubits is studied from the point of view of entanglement and separability properties . the method of qubit portrait of qudit states is used to get the entropic inequalities for the entangled state of the single qudit . the tomographic probability representation of the qudit x - state under consideration and its shannon and q - entropic characteristics are presented in explicit form .
