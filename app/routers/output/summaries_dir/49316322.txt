noisy , intermediate - scale quantum ( nisq ) computers are expected to execute quantum circuits of up to a few hundred qubits . the circuits have to satisfy certain constraints concerning the placement and interactions of the involved qubits . hence , a compiler takes an input circuit not conforming to a nisq architecture and transforms it to a conforming output circuit . nisq hardware is faulty and insufficient to implement computational fault - tolerance , such that computation results will be faulty , too . accordingly , compilers need to optimise the depth and the gate count of the compiled circuits , because these influence the aggregated computation result error . this work discusses the complexity of compilation with a particular focus on the search space structure . the presented analysis decomposes the compilation problem into three combinatorial subproblems for which heuristics can be determined . the search space structure is the result of analysing jointly the gate sequence of the input circuit and its influence on how qubits have to be mapped to a nisq architecture . these findings support the development of future nisq compilers .
