to facilitate quantum simulation of open quantum systems at finite temperatures , an important ingredient is to achieve thermalization on a given time - scale . we consider a rydberg aggregate ( an arrangement of rydberg atoms that interact via long - range interactions ) embedded in a laser - driven atomic environment . for the smallest aggregate ( two atoms ) , suitable laser parameters can be found by brute force scanning of the four tunable laser parameters . for more atoms , however , such parameter scans are too computationally costly . here we apply gaussian processes to predict the thermalization performance as a function of the laser parameters for two - atom and four - atom aggregates . these predictions perform remarkably well using just 1000 simulations , demonstrating the utility of gaussian processes in an atomic physics setting . using this approach , we find and present effective laser parameters for generating thermalization , the robustness of these parameters to variation , as well as different thermalization dynamics .
