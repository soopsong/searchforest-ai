we investigate a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) as a gravitational wave detector , and study its sensitivity by optimizing the properties of the condensate and the measurement duration . we show that detecting kilohertz gravitational waves is limited by current experimental techniques in squeezing bec phonons . future improvements in technology to squeeze bec states can make them competitive detectors for gravitational waves of astrophysical and/or cosmological origin .
