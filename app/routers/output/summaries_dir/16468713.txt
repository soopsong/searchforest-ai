we consider a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a double quantum dot . we demonstrate how the finite - frequency current noise spectrum through the double quantum dot can be used to distinguish classical and quantum behaviour in the nearby nano - electromechanical resonator . we also show how the full frequency current noise spectrum gives important information on the combined double quantum dot - resonator energy spectrum . finally , we point out regimes where the quantum state of the resonator becomes squeezed , and also examine the cross - correlated electron - phonon current noise .
