hawking radiation , when treated in the ray optics limit , exhibits the unfortunate trans - planckian problem --- a hawking photon near spatial infinity , if back - tracked to the immediate vicinity of the horizon is hugely blue - shifted and found to have had trans - planckian energy . ( and if back - tracked all the way to the horizon , the photon is formally infinitely blue - shifted , and formally acquires infinite energy . ) unruh has forcefully argued that this implies that the hawking flux represents a vacuum instability in the presence of a horizon , and that the hawking photons are actually emitted from some region exterior to the horizon . we seek to make this idea more precise and somewhat explicit by building a purely kinematical model for hawking evaporation based on two vaidya spacetimes ( outer and inner ) joined across a thin time - like boundary layer . the kinematics of this model is already quite rich , and we shall defer consideration of the dynamics for subsequent work . in particular we shall present an explicit calculation of the the 4-acceleration of the shell ( including the effects of gravity , motion , and the outgoing null flux ) and relate this 4-acceleration to the unruh temperature .
