we designed high - efficiency error correcting codes allowing to extract an errorless secret key in a continuous - variable quantum key distribution protocol using a gaussian modulation of coherent states and a homodyne detection . these codes are available for a wide range of signal - to - noise ratios on an awgn channel with a binary modulation and can be combined with a multidimensional reconciliation method proven secure against arbitrary collective attacks . this improved reconciliation procedure considerably extends the secure range of a continuous - variable quantum key distribution with a gaussian modulation , giving a secret key rate of about 10^{-3 } bit per pulse at a distance of 120 km for reasonable physical parameters .
