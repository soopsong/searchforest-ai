we present the optical and mechanical design of a mechanically compliant quasi - two - dimensional photonic crystal cavity formed from thin - film silicon in which a pair of linear nanoscale slots are used to create two coupled high-$q$ optical resonances . the optical cavity supermodes , whose frequencies are designed to lie in the $ 1500$~nm wavelength band , are shown to interact strongly with mechanical resonances of the structure whose frequencies range from a few mhz to a few ghz . depending upon the symmetry of the mechanical modes and the symmetry of the slot sizes , we show that the optomechanical coupling between the optical supermodes can be either linear or quadratic in the mechanical displacement amplitude . tuning of the nanoscale slot size is also shown to adjust the magnitude and sign of the cavity supermode splitting $ 2j$ , enabling near - resonant motional scattering between the two optical supermodes and greatly enhancing the $ x^2$-coupling strength . specifically , for the fundamental flexural mode of the central nanobeam of the structure at $ 10$~mhz the per - phonon linear cross - mode coupling rate is calculated to be $ \tilde{g}_{+-}/2\pi = 1$~mhz , corresponding to a per - phonon $ x^2$-coupling rate of $ \tilde{g}'/2\pi=1$~khz for a mode splitting $ 2j/2\pi = 1$~ghz which is greater than the radiation - limited supermode linewidths .
