quantum transport is strongly influenced by interference with phase relations that depend sensitively on the scattering medium . since even small changes in the geometry of the medium can turn constructive interference to destructive , a clear relation between structure and fast , efficient transport is difficult to identify . here we present a complex network analysis of quantum transport through disordered systems to elucidate the relationship between transport efficiency and structural organization . evidence is provided for the emergence of structural classes with different geometries but similar high efficiency . specifically , a structural motif characterised by pair sites which are not actively participating to the dynamics renders transport properties robust against perturbations . our results pave the way for a systematic rationalization of the design principles behind highly efficient transport which is of paramount importance for technological applications as well as to address transport robustness in natural light harvesting complexes .
