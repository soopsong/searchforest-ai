using the born - oppenheimer approximation , we derive an effective hamiltonian for an optomechanical system that leads to a nonlinear kerr effect in the system 's vacuum . the oscillating mirror at one edge of the optomechanical system induces a squeezing effect in the intensity spectrum of the cavity field . a near - resonant laser field is applied at the other edge to drive the cavity field , in order to enhance the kerr effect . we also propose a quantum - nondemolition - measurement setup to monitor a system with two cavities separated by a common oscillating mirror , based on our effective hamiltonian approach .
