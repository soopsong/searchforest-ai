we report a continuous variable key distribution system that achieves a final secure key rate of 3.45 kb / sec over a distance of 24.2 km of optical fiber . the protocol uses discrete signaling and post - selection to improve reconciliation speed and quantifies security by means of quantum state tomography . polarization multiplexing and a frequency translation scheme permit transmission of a continuous wave local oscillator and suppression of noise from guided acoustic wave brillouin scattering by more than 27 db .
