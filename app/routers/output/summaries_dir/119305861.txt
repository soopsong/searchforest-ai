in this paper , we study the interaction between a three - level atom and a quantized single - mode field with $ ` ` $ intensity - dependent coupling$"$ in a $ ` ` $ kerr medium$"$. the three - level atom is considered to be in a $ \lambda$-type configuration . under particular initial conditions , which may be prepared for the atom and the field , the dynamical state vector of the entire system will be explicitly obtained , for arbitrary nonlinearity function $ f(n)$ associated to any physical system . then , after evaluating the variation of the field entropy against time , we will investigate the quantum statistics as well as some of the nonclassical properties of the introduced state . during our calculations we investigate the effects of intensity - dependent coupling , kerr medium and detuning parameters on the depth and domain of the nonclassicality features of the atom - field state vector . finally , we compare our obtained results with those of $ v$-type three - level atoms .
