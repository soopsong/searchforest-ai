building upon the demonstration of coherent control and single - shot readout of the electron and nuclear spins of individual 31-p atoms in silicon , we present here a systematic experimental estimate of quantum gate fidelities using randomized benchmarking of 1-qubit gates in the clifford group . we apply this analysis to the electron and the ionized 31-p nucleus of a single p donor in isotopically purified 28-si . we find average gate fidelities of 99.95 % for the electron , and 99.99 % for the nuclear spin . these values are above certain error correction thresholds , and demonstrate the potential of donor - based quantum computing in silicon . by studying the influence of the shape and power of the control pulses , we find evidence that the present limitation to the gate fidelity is mostly related to the external hardware , and not the intrinsic behaviour of the qubit .
