we propose a method for shortcut to adiabatic control of soliton matter waves in harmonic traps . the tunable interaction controlled by feshbach resonance is inversely designed to achieve fast compression of soliton matter waves but within a short time , as compared to the conventional adiabatic compression . these results pave the way to control the nonlinear dynamics for matter waves and optical solitons by using shortcuts to adiabaticity .
