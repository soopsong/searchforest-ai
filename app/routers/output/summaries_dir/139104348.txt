artificial neural network , consisting of many neurons in different layers , is an important method to simulate humain brain . usually , one neuron has two operations : one is linear , the other is nonlinear . the linear operation is inner product and the nonlinear operation is represented by an activation function . in this work , we introduce a kind of quantum neuron whose inputs and outputs are quantum states . the inner product and activation operator of the quantum neurons can be realized by quantum circuits . based on the quantum neuron , we propose a model of quantum neural network in which the weights between neurons are all quantum states . we also construct a quantum circuit to realize this quantum neural network model . a learning algorithm is proposed meanwhile . we show the validity of learning algorithm theoretically and demonstrate the potential of the quantum neural network numerically .
