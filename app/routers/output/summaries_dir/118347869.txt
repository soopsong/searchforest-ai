we propose a technique that enables the creation of quantum discord between two distant nodes , each containing a cavity consist of the bose - einstein condensate , by applying a non - ideal bell - like detection on the output modes of optical cavities . we find the covariance matrix of the system after the non - ideal bell - like detection , showing explicitly that one enables manipulation of the quantum correlations , and particularly quantum discord , between remote bose - einstein condensates . we also find that the non - ideal bell - like detection can create entanglement between distant bose - einstein condensates at the two remote sites
