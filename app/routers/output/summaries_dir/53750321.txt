schemes for optical - state truncation of two cavity modes are analysed . the systems , referred to as the nonlinear quantum scissors devices , comprise two coupled nonlinear oscillators ( kerr nonlinear coupler ) with one or two of them pumped by external classical fields . it is shown that the quantum evolution of the pumped couplers can be closed in a two - qubit hilbert space spanned by vacuum and single - photon states only . thus , the pumped couplers can behave as a two - qubit system . analysis of time evolution of the quantum entanglement shows that bell states can be generated . a possible implementation of the couplers is suggested in a pumped double - ring cavity with resonantly enhanced kerr nonlinearities in an electromagnetically - induced transparency scheme . the fragility of the generated states and their entanglement due to the standard dissipation and phase damping are discussed by numerically solving two types of master equations .
