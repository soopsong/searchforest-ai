the ability to perform a universal set of quantum operations based solely on static resources and measurements presents us with a strikingly novel viewpoint for thinking about quantum computation and its powers . we consider the two major models for doing quantum computation by measurements that have hitherto appeared in the literature and show that they are conceptually closely related by demonstrating a systematic local mapping between them . this way we effectively unify the two models , showing that they make use of interchangeable primitives . with the tools developed for this mapping , we then construct more resource - effective methods for performing computation within both models and propose schemes for the construction of arbitrary graph states employing two - qubit measurements alone .
