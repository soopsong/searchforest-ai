in this work , we show that the application of a sol - gel coating renders a microbubble whispering gallery resonator into an active device . during the fabrication of the resonator , a thin layer of erbium - doped sol - gel is applied to a tapered microcapillary , then a microbubble with a wall thickness of 1.3 $ \mu$m is formed with the rare earth diffused into its walls . the doped microbubble is pumped at 980 nm and lasing in the emission band of the er$^{3+}$ ions with a wavelength of 1535 nm is observed . the laser wavelength can be tuned by aerostatic pressure tuning of the whispering gallery modes of the microbubble . up to 240 pm tuning is observed with 2 bar of applied pressure . it is shown that the doped microbubble could be used as a compact , tunable laser source . the lasing microbubble can also be used to improve sensing capabilities in optofluidic sensing applications .
