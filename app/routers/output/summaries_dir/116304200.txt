we present a practical and general scheme of remote preparation for pure and mixed state , in which an auxiliary qubit and controlled - not gate are used . we discuss the remote state preparation ( rsp ) in two important types of decoherent channel ( depolarizing and dephaseing ) . in our experiment , we realize rsp in the dephaseing channel by using spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) , linear optical elements and single photon detector .
