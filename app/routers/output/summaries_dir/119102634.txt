we show that it is possible to find maximal violations of the chsh - bell inequality using only position measurements on a pair of entangled non - relativistic free particles . the device settings required in the chsh inequality are done by choosing one of two times at which position is measured . for different assignments of the"+"outcome to positions , namely to an interval , to a half line , or to a periodic set , we determine violations of the inequalities , and states where they are attained . these results have consequences for the hidden variable theories of bohm and nelson , in which the two - time correlations between distant particle trajectories have a joint distribution , and hence can not violate any bell inequality .
