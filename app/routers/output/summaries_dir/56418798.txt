bell 's theorem states that , to simulate the correlations created by measurement on pure entangled quantum states , shared randomness is not enough : some"non - local"resources are required . it has been demonstrated recently that all projective measurements on the maximally entangled state of two qubits can be simulated with a single use of a"non - local machine " . we prove that a strictly larger amount of this non - local resource is required for the simulation of pure non - maximally entangled states of two qubits $ \ket{\psi(\alpha)}= \cos\alpha\ket{00}+\sin\alpha\ket{11}$ with $ 0<\alpha\lesssim\frac{\pi}{7.8}$.
