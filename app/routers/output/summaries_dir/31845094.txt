we report a teleportation experiment involving narrowband entangled photons at 1560 nm and qubit photons at 795 nm emulated by faint laser pulses . a nonlinear difference frequency generation stage converts the 795 nm photons to 1560 nm in order to enable interference with one photon out of the pairs , i.e. , at the same wavelength . the spectral bandwidth of all involved photons is of about 25 mhz , which is close to the emission bandwidth of emissive quantum memory devices , notably those based on ensembles of cold atoms and rare earth ions . this opens the route towards the realization of hybrid quantum nodes , i.e. , combining quantum memories and entanglement - based quantum relays exploiting either a synchronized ( pulsed ) or asynchronous ( continuous- wave ) scenario .
