we propose a system of two interacting always - on , exchange - only qubits for which cphase , cnot , quantum fourier transform ( qft ) and swap operations can be implemented only in a few electrical pulses in a nanosecond time scale . each qubit is built of three quantum dots ( tqd ) in a triangular geometry with three electron spins which are always kept coupled by exchange interactions only . the qubit states are encoded in a doublet subspace and are fully electrically controlled by a voltage applied to gate electrodes . the two qubit quantum gates are realized by short electrical pulses which change the triangular symmetry of tqd and switch on exchange interaction between the qubits . we found an optimal configuration to implement the $ cphase$ gate by a single pulse of the order 2.3 ns . using this gate , in combination with single qubit operations , we searched for optimal conditions to perform the other gates : cnot , qft and swap . our studies take into account environment effects and leakage processes as well . the results suggest that the system can be implemented for fault tolerant quantum computations .
