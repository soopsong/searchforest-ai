we study the entanglement in a chain of harmonic oscillators driven out of equilibrium by preparing the two sides of the system at different temperatures , and subsequently joining them together . the steady state is constructed explicitly and the logarithmic negativity is calculated between two adjacent segments of the chain . we find that , for low temperatures , the steady - state entanglement is a sum of contributions pertaining to left- and right - moving excitations emitted from the two reservoirs . in turn , the steady - state entanglement is a simple average of the gibbs - state values and thus its scaling can be obtained from conformal field theory . a similar averaging behaviour is observed during the entire time evolution . as a particular case , we also discuss a local quench where both sides of the chain are initialized in their respective ground states .
