a chain rule and a subadditivity for the entropy of type $ \beta$ , which is one of the nonadditive entropies , were derived by z.dar\'oczy . in this paper , we study the further relations among tsallis type entropies which are typical nonadditive entropies . the chain rule is generalized by showing it for tsallis relative entropy and the nonadditive entropy . we show some inequalities related to tsallis entropies , especially the strong subadditivity for tsallis type entropies and the subadditivity for the nonadditive entropies . the subadditivity and the strong subadditivity naturally lead to define tsallis mutual entropy and tsallis conditional mutual entropy , respectively , and then we show again chain rules for tsallis mutual entropies . we give properties of entropic distances in terms of tsallis entropies . finally we show parametrically extended results based on information theory .
