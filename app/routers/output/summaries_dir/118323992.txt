we discuss theoretically the ground state of a bose - einstein condensate with attractive atom - atom interactions in a double - well trap as a starting point of heisenberg - limited atom interferometry . the dimensionless parameter governing the quality of the ground state for this purpose is identified . the near - degeneracy between the ground state and the first excited state severely curtails the prospects of the thermally prepared ground state in quantum metrology .
