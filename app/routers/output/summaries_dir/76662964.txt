we propose a technique for robust optomechanical state transfer using phase - tailored composite pulse driving with constant amplitude . our proposal is inspired by coherent control techniques in lossless driven qubits . we demonstrate that there exist optimal phases for maximally robust excitation exchange in lossy strongly - driven optomechanical state transfer . in addition , our proposed composite phase driving also protects against random variations in the parameters of the system . however , this driving can take the system out of its steady state . for this reason , we use the ideal optimal phases to produce smooth sequences that both maintain the system close to its steady state and optimize the robustness of optomechanical state transfer .
