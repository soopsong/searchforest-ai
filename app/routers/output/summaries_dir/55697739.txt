perturbative bulk reconstruction in ads / cft starts by representing a free bulk field $ \phi^{(0)}$ as a smeared operator in the cft . a series of $ 1 / n$ corrections must be added to $ \phi^{(0)}$ to represent an interacting bulk field $ \phi$. these corrections have been determined in the literature from several points of view . here we develop a new perspective . we show that correlation functions involving $ \phi^{(0)}$ suffer from ambiguities due to analytic continuation . as a result $ \phi^{(0)}$ fails to be a well - defined linear operator in the cft . this means bulk reconstruction can be understood as a procedure for building up well - defined operators in the cft which thereby singles out the interacting field $ \phi$. we further propose that the difficulty with defining $ \phi^{(0)}$ as a linear operator can be re - interpreted as a breakdown of associativity . presumably $ \phi^{(0)}$ can only be corrected to become an associative operator in perturbation theory . this suggests that quantum mechanics in the bulk is only valid in perturbation theory around a semiclassical bulk geometry .
