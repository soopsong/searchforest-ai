quantum computing promises a new approach to solving difficult computational problems , and the quest of building a quantum computer has started . while the first attempts on construction were succesful , scalability has never been achieved , due to the inherent fragile nature of the quantum bits ( qubits ) . from the multitude of approaches to achieve scalability topological quantum computing ( tqc ) is the most promising one , by being based on an flexible approach to error - correction and making use of the straightforward measurement - based computing technique . tqc circuits are defined within a large , uniform , 3-dimensional lattice of physical qubits produced by the hardware and the physical volume of this lattice directly relates to the resources required for computation . circuit optimization may result in non - intuitive mismatches between circuit specification and implementation . in this paper we introduce the first method for cross - level validation of tqc circuits . the specification of the circuit is expressed based on the stabilizer formalism , and the stabilizer table is checked by mapping the topology on the physical qubit level , followed by quantum circuit simulation . simulation results show that cross - level validation of error - corrected circuits is feasible .
