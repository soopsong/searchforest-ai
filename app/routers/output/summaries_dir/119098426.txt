the dynamics of a charged two - qubit system prepared initially in a maximum entangled state is discussed , where each qubit interacts independently with a dephasing channel . the fisher information is used to estimate the channel and the energy parameters . moreover , the contribution from different parts of fisher information is discussed . we show that , the degree of estimation of any parameter depends on the initial value of this parameter . it turns out that the upper bounds of fisher information with respect to the dephasing parameter increase and that corresponding to coupling parameter decreases as the initial energy of each qubit increases .
