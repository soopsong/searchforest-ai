we propose a mechanism to interface a transmission line resonator ( tlr ) with a nano - mechanical resonator ( namr ) by commonly coupling them to a charge qubit , a cooper pair box with a controllable gate voltage . integrated in this quantum transducer or simple quantum network , the charge qubit plays the role of a controllable quantum node coherently exchanging quantum information between the tlr and namr . with such an interface , a maser - like process is predicted to create a quasi - classical state of the namr by controlling a single - mode classical current in the tlr . alternatively , a"cooper pair"coherent output through the transmission line can be driven by a single - mode classical oscillation of the namr .
