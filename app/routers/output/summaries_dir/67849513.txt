in a recent experiment [ vochezer { \it et al . , } phys . rev . lett . \textbf{120 } , 073602 ( 2018 ) ] , a novel kind of hybrid atom - opto - mechanical system has been realized by coupling atoms in a lattice to a membrane . while such system promises a viable contender in the competitive field of simulating non - equilibrium many - body physics , its complete steady - state phase diagram is still lacking . here we study the phase diagram of this hybrid system based on an atomic bose - hubbard model coupled to a quantum harmonic oscillator . we take both the expectation value of the bosonic operator and the mechanical motion of the membrane as order parameters , and thereby identify four different quantum phases . importantly , we find the atomic gas in the steady state of such non - equilibrium setting undergoes a superfluid - mott - insulator transition when the atom - membrane coupling is tuned to increase . such steady - state phase transition can be seen as the non - equilibrium counterpart of the conventional superfluid - mott - insulator transition in the ground state of bose - hubbard model . further , no matter which phase the quantum gas is in , the mechanic motion of the membrane exhibits a transition from an incoherent vibration to a coherent one when the atom - membrane coupling increases , agreeing with the experimental observations . our present study provides a simple way to study non - equilibrium many - body physics that is complementary to ongoing experiments on the hybrid atomic and opto - mechanical systems .
