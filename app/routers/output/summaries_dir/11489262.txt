we present a quantum heat switch based on coupled superconducting qubits , connected to two $ lc$ resonators that are terminated by resistors providing two heat baths . to describe the system we use a standard second order master equation with respect to coupling to the baths . we find that this system can act as an efficient heat switch controlled by the applied magnetic flux . the flux influences the energy level separations of the system , and under some conditions , the finite coupling of the qubits enhances the transmitted power between the two baths , by an order of magnitude under realistic conditions . at the same time , the bandwidth at maximum power of the switch formed of the coupled qubits is narrowed .
