we attempt to extract a homological structure of two kinds of graphs by the grover walk . the first one consists of a cycle and two semi - infinite lines and the second one is assembled by a periodic embedding of the cycles in $ \mathbb{z}$. we show that both of them have essentially the same eigenvalues induced by the existence of cycles in the infinite graphs . the eigenspace of the homological structure appears as so called { \it localization } in the grover walks , in that the walk is partially trapped by the homological structure . on the other hand , the difference of the absolutely continuous part of spectrum between them provides different behaviors . we characterize the behaviors by the density functions in the weak convergence theorem : the first one is the delta measure at the bottom while the second one is expressed by two kinds of continuous functions which have different finite supports $ ( -1/\sqrt{10},1/\sqrt{10})$ and $ ( -2/7,2/7)$ , respectively .
