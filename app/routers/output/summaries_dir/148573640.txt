we study the application of a counter - diabatic driving ( cd ) technique to enhance the thermodynamic efficiency and power of a quantum otto refrigerator based on a superconducting qubit coupled to two resonant circuits . although the cd technique is originally designed to counteract non - adiabatic coherent excitations in isolated systems , we find that it also works effectively in the open system dynamics , improving the coherence - induced losses of efficiency and power . we compare the cd dynamics with its classical counterpart , and find a deviation that arises because the cd is designed to follow the energy eigenbasis of the original hamiltonian , but the heat baths thermalize the system in a different basis . we also discuss possible experimental realizations of our model .
