the dissociation of molecules , even the most simple hydrogen molecule , can not be described accurately within density functional theory because none of the currently available functionals accounts for strong on - site correlation . this problem has led to a discussion of properties that the local kohn - sham potential has to satisfy in order to correctly describe strongly correlated systems . we derive an analytic expression for this potential at the dissociation limit and show that the numerical calculations for a one - dimensional two electron model system indeed approach and reach this limit . it is shown that the functional form of the potential is universal , i.e. independent of the details of the system .
