the class of nonlinear ordinary differential equations $ y^{\prime\prime}y = f(z , y^2)$ , where f is a smooth function , is studied . various nonlinear ordinary differential equations , whose applicative importance is well known , belong to such a class of nonlinear ordinary differential equations . indeed , the emden - fowler equation , the ermakov - pinney equation and the generalized ermakov equations are among them . b\"acklund transformations and auto b\"acklund transformations are constructed : these last transformations induce the construction of a ladder of new solutions adimitted by the given differential equations starting from a trivial solutions . notably , the highly nonlinear structure of this class of nonlinear ordinary differential equations implies that numerical methods are very difficulty to apply .
