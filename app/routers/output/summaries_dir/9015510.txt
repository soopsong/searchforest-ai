we report the design and implementation of a complete electronics platform for conducting a quantum optics experiment that will be operated on board a 1u cubesat ( a 10 x 10 x 10 cm satellite ) . the quantum optics experiment is designed to produce polarization - entangled photon pairs using non - linear optical crystals and requires opto - electronic components such as a pump laser , single photon detectors and liquid crystal based polarization rotators in addition to passive optical elements . the platform provides mechanical support for the optical assembly . it also communicates autonomously with the host satellite to provide experiment data for transmission to a ground station . a limited number of commands can be transmitted from ground to the platform enabling it to switch experimental modes . this platform requires less than 1.5w for all operations , and is space qualified . the implementation of this electronics platform is a major step on the road to operating quantum communication experiments using nanosatellites .
