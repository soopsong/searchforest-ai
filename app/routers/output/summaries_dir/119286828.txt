area law violations for entanglement entropy in the form of a square root has recently been studied for one - dimensional frustration - free quantum systems based on the motzkin walks and their variations . here we consider a motzkin walk with a different hilbert space on each step of the walk spanned by elements of a { \it symmetric inverse semigroup } with the direction of each step governed by its algebraic structure . this change alters the number of paths allowed in the motzkin walk and introduces a ground state degeneracy sensitive to boundary perturbations . we study the frustration - free spin chains based on three symmetric inverse semigroups , $ \cs^3_1 $ , $ \cs^3_2 $ and $ \cs^2_1$. the system based on $ \cs^3_1 $ and $ \cs^3_2 $ provide examples of quantum phase transitions in one dimensions with the former exhibiting a transition between the area law and a logarithmic violation of the area law and the latter providing an example of transition from logarithmic scaling to a square root scaling in the system size , mimicking a colored $ \cs^3_1 $ system . the system with $ \cs^2_1 $ is much simpler and produces states that continue to obey the area law .
