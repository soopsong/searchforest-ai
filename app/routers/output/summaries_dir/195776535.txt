the capability to embed quantum dots ( qds ) at predefined positions in nanophotonic structures is key to the development of complex quantum photonic architectures . here , we demonstrate that qds can be deterministically positioned in nanophotonic waveguides by pre - locating qds relative to a global reference frame using micro - photoluminescence spectroscopy . after nanofabrication , qd - waveguide misalignments of only ( $ 9\pm46 $ ) nm and ( $ 1\pm33 $ ) nm are measured , for qds embedded in undoped and doped membranes , respectively . a priori knowledge of the qd positions allows us to study the spectral changes introduced by nanofabrication . we record average spectral shifts ranging from 0.1 to 1.1 nm only , indicating that the fabrication - induced shifts can generally be compensated by electrical or thermal tuning of the qds . finally , we quantify the effects of the nanofabrication on different charge states of the qds excitons , showing that this change is constant as a function of qd - to - surface separation , down to distances of only 70 nm . these results show that our approach can deterministically integrate qds into nanophotonic waveguides whose light - fields contain nanoscale structure and whose spectral response varies at the nanometer level , such as photonic crystal waveguides or cavities .
