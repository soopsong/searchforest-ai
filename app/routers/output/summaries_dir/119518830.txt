the article is addressing a possibility of implementation of spin network states on adiabatic quantum computer . the discussion is focused on application of currently available technologies and analyzes a concrete example of d - wave machine . a class of simple spin network states which can be implemented on the chimera graph architecture of the d - wave quantum processor is introduced . however , extension beyond the currently available quantum processor topologies is required to simulate more sophisticated spin network states , which may inspire development of new generations of adiabatic quantum computers . a possibility of simulating loop quantum gravity is discussed and a method of solving a graph non - changing scalar ( hamiltonian ) constraint with the use of adiabatic quantum computations is proposed .
