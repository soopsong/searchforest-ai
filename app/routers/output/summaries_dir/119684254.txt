the concept of a controlled flow of a dynamical system , especially when the controlling process feeds information back about the system , is of central importance in control engineering . in this paper we build on the ideas presented by bouten and van handel ( l. bouten , r. van handel,"on the separation principle of quantum control " , in quantum stochastics and information : statistics , filtering and control , world scientific , 2008 ) and develop a general theory of quantum feedback . we elucidate the relationship between the controlling processes $ z$ and the measured process $ y$ , and to this end make a distinction between what we call the input picture and the output picture . we should that the input - output relations for the noise fields have additional terms not present in the standard theory , but that the relationship between the control processes and measured processes themselves are internally consistent - we do this for the two main cases of quadrature measurement and photon - counting measurement . the theory is general enough to include a modulating filter which processes the measurement readout $ y$ before returning to the system . this opens up the prospect of applying very general engineering feedback control techniques to open quantum systems in a systematic manner , and we consider a number of specific modulating filter problems . finally , we give a brief argument as to why most of the rules for making instantaneous feedback connections ( j. gough , m.r . james,"quantum feedback networks : hamiltonian formulation " , commun . math . phys . , 287 , 1109 , 2009 ) ought to apply for controlled dynamical networks as well .
