a permutation - invariant quantum code on $ n$ qudits is any subspace stabilized by the matrix representation of the symmetric group $ s_n$ as permutation matrices that permute the underlying $ n$ subsystems . when each subsystem is a complex euclidean space of dimension $ q \ge 2 $ , any permutation - invariant code is a subspace of the symmetric subspace of $ ( \mathbb c^q)^n.$ we give an algebraic construction of new families of of $ d$-dimensional permutation - invariant codes on at least $ ( 2t+1)^2(d-1)$ qudits that can also correct $ t$ errors for $ d \ge 2$. the construction of our codes relies on a real polynomial with multiple roots at the roots of unity , and a sequence of $ q-1 $ real polynomials that satisfy some combinatorial constraints . when $ n>(2t+1)^2(d-1)$ , we prove constructively that an uncountable number of such codes exist .
