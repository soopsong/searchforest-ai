we propose a general method to operationally quantify the resourcefulness of quantum channels via channel discrimination , an important information processing task . a main result is that the maximum success probability of distinguishing a given channel from the set of free channels by free probe states is exactly characterized by the resource generating power , i.e. the maximum amount of resource produced by the action of the channel , given by the trace distance to the set of free states . we apply this framework to the resource theory of quantum coherence , as an informative example . the general results can also be easily applied to other resource theories such as entanglement , magic states , and asymmetry .
