quantum computing ( qc ) is an emerging computing paradigm with potential to revolutionize the field of computing . qc is a field that is quickly developing globally and has high barriers of entry . in this paper we explore both successful contributors to the field as well as wider qc community with the goal of understanding the backgrounds and training that helped them succeed . we gather data on 148 contributors to open - source quantum computing projects hosted on github and survey 46 members of qc community . our findings show that qc practitioners and enthusiasts have diverse backgrounds , with most of them having a phd and trained in physics or computer science . we observe a lack of educational resources on quantum computing . our goal for these findings is to start a conversation about how best to prepare the next generation of qc researchers and practitioners .
