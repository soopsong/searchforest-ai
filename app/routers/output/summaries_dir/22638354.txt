we construct an error - detected block , assisted by the quantum - dot spins in double - sided optical microcavities . with this block , we propose three error - detected schemes for the deterministic generation , the complete analysis , and the complete nondestructive analysis of hyperentangled bell states in both the polarization and spatial - mode degrees of freedom of two - photon systems . in these schemes , the errors can be detected , which can improve their fidelities largely , far different from other previous schemes assisted by the interaction between the photon and the quantum - dot - cavity system . our scheme for the deterministic generation of hyperentangled two - photon systems can be performed by repeat until success . these features make our schemes more useful in high - capacity quantum communication with hyperentanglement in the future .
