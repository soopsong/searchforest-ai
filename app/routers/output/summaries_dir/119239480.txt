we analyze the security of a quantum secure direct communication protocol equipped with authentication . we first propose a specifc attack on the protocol by which , an adversary can break the secret already shared between alice and bob , when he ( adversary ) runs the protocol few times . the attack shows that there is a gap in authentication procedure of the protocol , and by doing so the adversary can obtain the key without remaining any trace . we then give the modification of the protocol and analyze the security of it , and show how the modified protocol can close the gap .
