gravitational - wave astronomy can give us access to the structure of black holes , potentially probing microscopic or even planckian corrections at the horizon scale , as those predicted by some quantum - gravity models of exotic compact objects . a generic feature of these models is the replacement of the horizon by a reflective surface . objects with these properties are prone to the so - called ergoregion instability when they spin sufficiently fast . we investigate in detail a simple model consisting of scalar perturbations of a kerr geometry with a reflective surface near the horizon . the instability depends on the spin , on the compactness , and on the reflectivity at the surface . the instability time scale increases only logarithmically in the black - hole limit and , for a perfectly reflecting object , this is not enough to prevent the instability from occurring on dynamical time scales . however , we find that an absorption rate at the surface as small as 0.4 % ( reflectivity coefficient as large as $ |{\cal r}|^2=0.996 $ ) is sufficient to quench the instability completely . our results suggest that exotic compact objects are not necessarily ruled out by the ergoregion instability .
