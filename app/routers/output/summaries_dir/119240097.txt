we analyze a photon transport through an 1d open waveguide side coupled to the $ n$-photon microwave cavity with embedded artificial two- level atom ( qubit ) . the qubit state is probed by a weak signal at the fundamental frequency of the waveguide . within the formalism of projection operators and non - hermitian hamiltonian approach we develop a one - photon approximation scheme to obtain the photon wavefunction which allows for the calculation of the probability amplitudes of the spontaneous transitions between the levels of two rabi doublets in $ n$- photon cavity . we obtain analytic expressions for the transmission and reflection factors of the microwave signal through a waveguide , which contain the information of the qubit parameters . we show that for small number of cavity photons the mollow spectrum consists of four spectral lines which is a direct manifestation of quantum nature of light . the results obtained in the paper are of general nature and can be applied to any type of qubits . the specific properties of the qubit are only encoded in the two parameters : the energy $ \omega$ of the qubit and its coupling $ \lambda$ to the cavity photons .
