the class of memory circuit elements which comprises memristive , memcapacitive , and meminductive systems , is gaining considerable attention in a broad range of disciplines . this is due to the enormous flexibility these elements provide in solving diverse problems in analog / neuromorphic and digital / quantum computation ; the possibility to use them in an integrated computing - memory paradigm , massively - parallel solution of different optimization problems , learning , neural networks , etc . the time is therefore ripe to introduce these elements to the next generation of physicists and engineers with appropriate teaching tools that can be easily implemented in undergraduate teaching laboratories . in this paper , we suggest the use of easy - to - build emulators to provide a hands - on experience for the students to learn the fundamental properties and realize several applications of these memelements . we provide explicit examples of problems that could be tackled with these emulators that range in difficulty from the demonstration of the basic properties of memristive , memcapacitive , and meminductive systems to logic / computation and cross - bar memory . the emulators can be built from off - the - shelf components , with a total cost of a few tens of dollars , thus providing a relatively inexpensive platform for the implementation of these exercises in the classroom . we anticipate that this experiment - based learning can be easily adopted and expanded by the instructors with many more case studies .
