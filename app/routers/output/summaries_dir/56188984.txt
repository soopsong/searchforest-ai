we propose a new approach in lagrangian formalism for studying the fluid dynamics on noncommutative space . starting with the poisson bracket for single particle , a map from canonical lagrangian variables to eulerian variables is constructed for taking into account of the noncommutative effects . the advantage of this approach is that the kinematic and potential energies in the lagrangian formalism continuously change in the infinite limit to the ones in eulerian formalism , and hence make sure that both the kinematical and potential energies are taken into account correctly . furthermore , in our approach , the equations of motion of the mass density and current density are naturally expressed into conservative form . based on this approach , the noncommutative poisson bracket is introduced , and the noncommutative algebra among eulerian variables , as well as the noncommutative corrections on the equations of motion are obtained . we find that the noncommutative corrections generally depend on the derivatives of potential under consideration . furthermore , we find that the noncommutative algebra does modify the usual friedmann equation , and the noncommutative corrections measure the symmetry properties of the density function $ \rho(\vec{z})$ under rotation around the direction $ \vec{\theta}$. this characterization results in vanishing corrections for spherically symmetric mass density distribution and potential .
