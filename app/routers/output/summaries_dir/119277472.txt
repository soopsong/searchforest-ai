we explain the phenomena of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) of a weak probe field and tunable fano resonances in hybrid optomechanics . the system of study consists of a two - level atom coupled to a single - mode field of an optomechanical resonator with a moving mirror . we show that a single eit window exists in the presence of optomechanical coupling or jaynes - cummings coupling , whereas two distinct double eit windows occur when both the couplings are simultaneously present . furthermore , based on our analytic and numerical work , we prove the existence of tunable fano resonances in the system . the controlling parameters of the system , which switch from a single eit window to double eit windows and are needed to tune the fano resonances , can be realized in present - day laboratory experiments .
