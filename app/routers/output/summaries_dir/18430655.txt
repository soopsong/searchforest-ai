we have designed and realized a prototype that implements a continuous - variable quantum key distribution protocol based on coherent states and reverse reconciliation . the system uses time and polarization multiplexing for optimal transmission and detection of the signal and phase reference , and employs sophisticated error - correction codes for reconciliation . the security of the system is guaranteed against general coherent eavesdropping attacks . the performance of the prototype was tested over preinstalled optical fibres as part of a quantum cryptography network combining different quantum key distribution technologies . the stable and automatic operation of the prototype over 57 hours yielded an average secret key distribution rate of 8 kbit / s over a 3 db loss optical fibre , including the key extraction process and all quantum and classical communication . this system is therefore ideal for securing communications in metropolitan size networks with high speed requirements .
