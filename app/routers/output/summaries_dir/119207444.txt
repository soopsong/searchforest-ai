we consider the dissipative single - qubit circuit qed architecture in which the atomic transition frequency undergoes a weak external time - modulation . for sinusoidal modulation with linearly varying frequency we derive effective hamiltonians that resemble the landau - zener problem of finite duration associated to a two- or multi - level systems . the corresponding off - diagonal coupling coefficients originate either from the rotating or the counter - rotating terms in the rabi hamiltonian , depending on the values of the modulation frequency . it is demonstrated that in the dissipation less case one can accomplish almost complete transitions between the eigenstates of the bare rabi hamiltonian even for relatively short duration of the frequency sweep . to assess the experimental feasibility of our scheme we solved numerically the phenomenological and the microscopic quantum master equations in the markovian regime at zero temperature . both models exhibit qualitatively similar behavior and indicate that photon generation from vacuum via effective landau - zener transitions could be implemented with the current technology on the timescales of a few microseconds . moreover , unlike the harmonic dynamical casimir effect implementations , our proposal does not require the precise knowledge of the resonant modulation frequency to accomplish meaningful photon generation .
