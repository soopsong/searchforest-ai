quantum circuits of many qubits are extremely difficult to realize ; thus , the number of qubits is an important metric in a quantum circuit design . further , scalable and reliable quantum circuits are based on clifford + t gates . an efficient quantum circuit saves quantum hardware resources by reducing the number of t gates without substantially increasing the number of qubits . recently , the design of a quantum multiplier is presented by babu [ 1 ] which improves the existing works in terms of number of quantum gates , number of qubits , and delay . however , the recent design is not based on fault - tolerant clifford + t gates . also , it has large number of qubits and garbage outputs . therefore , this work presents a t - count optimized quantum circuit for integer multiplication with only $ 4 \cdot n + 1 $ qubits and no garbage outputs . the proposed quantum multiplier design saves the t - count by using a novel quantum conditional adder circuit . also , where one operand to the controlled adder is zero , the conditional adder is replaced with a toffoli gate array to further save the t gates . to have fair comparison with the recent design by babu and get an actual estimate of the t - count , it is made garbageless by using bennett 's garbage removal scheme . the proposed design achieves an average t - count savings of $ 47.55\%$ compared to the recent work by babu . further , comparison is also performed with other recent works by lin et . al . [ 2 ] , and jayashree et . al.[3 ] . average t - count savings of $ 62.71\%$ and $ 26.30\%$ are achieved compared to the recent works by lin et . al . , and jayashree et . al . , respectively .
