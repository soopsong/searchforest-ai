quantum key distribution ( qkd ) gaurantees unconditional communication security based on the laws of quantum physics . however , practical qkd suffers from a number of quantum hackings due to the device imperfections . from the security standpoint , measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution ( mdi - qkd ) is in the limelight since it eliminates all the possible loopholes in detection . due to active control units for mode matching between the photons from remote parties , however , the implementation of mdi - qkd is highly impractical . in this article , we propose a novel method in which the indistinguishability issue is resolved without any active control unit . by introducing plug - and - play ( p&p ) concept into mdi - qkd , the indistinguishability between photons can naturally be guaranteed . we show the feasibility of p&p mdi - qkd with a proof - of - principle experiment .
