spontaneous synchronization is a significant collective behavior of weakly coupled systems . due to their inherent nonlinear nature , optomechanical systems can exhibit self - sustained oscillations which can be exploited for synchronizing different mechanical resonators . in this paper , we explore the synchronization dynamics of two membranes coupled to a common optical field within a cavity , and pumped with a strong blue - detuned laser drive . we focus on the system quantum dynamics in the parameter regime corresponding to synchronization of the classical motion of the two membranes . with an appropriate definition of the phase difference operator for the resonators , we study synchronization in the quantum case through the covariance matrix formalism . we find that for sufficiently large driving , quantum synchronization is robust with respect to quantum fluctuations and to thermal noise up to not too large temperatures . under synchronization , the two membranes are never entangled , while quantum discord behaves similarly to quantum synchronization , that is , it is larger when the variance of the phase difference is smaller .
