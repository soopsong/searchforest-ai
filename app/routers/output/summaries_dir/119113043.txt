optomechanics concerns with the coupling between optical cavities and mechanical resonators . most early works are concentrated in the physics of optomechanics in the small - displacement regime and consider one single optical cavity mode participating in the optomechanical coupling . in this paper , we focus on optomechanics in the extremely - large - amplitude regime in which a mechanical resonator is coupled with multiple optical cavity modes during the oscillation . we explicitly show that the mechanical resonator can present self - sustained oscillations in a novel way with limit cycles in the shape of sawtooth - edged ellipses and exhibit dynamical multistability . by analyzing the mechanical oscillation process and the accompanied variation of the optical cavity occupation , we develop an energy - balanced condition to ensure the stability of self - sustained oscillation . the effect of the mechanical nonlinearities on the dynamics of the mechanical resonator is also investigated .
