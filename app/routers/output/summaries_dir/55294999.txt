gibbons et al . [ phys . rev . a 70 , 062101(2004 ) ] have recently defined a class of discrete wigner functions w to represent quantum states in a hilbert space with finite dimension . we show that the only pure states having non - negative w for all such functions are stabilizer states , as conjectured by one of us [ phys . rev . a 71 , 042302 ( 2005 ) ] . we also show that the unitaries preserving non - negativity of w for all definitions of w form a subgroup of the clifford group . this means pure states with non - negative w and their associated unitary dynamics are classical in the sense of admitting an efficient classical simulation scheme using the stabilizer formalism .
