quantum computers require quantum arithmetic . we provide an explicit construction of quantum networks effecting basic arithmetic operations : from addition to modular exponentiation . quantum modular exponentiation seems to be the most difficult ( time and space consuming ) part of shor 's quantum factorising algorithm . we show that the auxiliary memory required to perform this operation in a reversible way grows linearly with the size of the number to be factorised .
