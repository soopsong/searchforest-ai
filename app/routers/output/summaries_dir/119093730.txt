we demonstrate the feasibility to completely characterize entanglement by negativities of quasiprobabilities . this requires the complete solution of a sophisticated mathematical problem , the so - called separability eigenvalue problem . its solution is obtained for a non - gaussian continuous variable quantum state , a two - mode squeezed state undergoing dephasing . this is a standard scenario for experiments with quantum - correlated radiation fields .
