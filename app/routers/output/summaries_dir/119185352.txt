we demonstrate squeezing of a strongly interacting opto - electromechanical system using a parametric drive . by employing real - time feedback on the phase of the pump at twice the resonance frequency the thermo - mechanical noise is squeezed beyond the 3 db instability limit . surprisingly , this method can also be used to generate highly nonlinear states . we show that using the parametric drive with feedback on , classical number - like and cat - like states can be prepared . this presents a valuable electro - optomechanical state - preparation protocol that is extendable to the quantum regime .
