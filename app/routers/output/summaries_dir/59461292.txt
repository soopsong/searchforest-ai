we study the connection between the phase behaviour of quantum dimers and the dynamics of classical stochastic dimers . at the so - called rokhsar - kivelson ( rk ) point a quantum dimer hamiltonian is equivalent to the markov generator of the dynamics of classical dimers . a less well understood fact is that away from the rk point the quantum - classical connection persists : in this case the hamiltonian corresponds to a non - stochastic"tilted"operator that encodes the statistics of time - integrated observables of the classical stochastic problem . this implies a direct relation between the phase behaviour of quantum dimers and properties of ensembles of stochastic trajectories of classical dimers . we make these ideas concrete by studying fully packed dimers on the square lattice . using transition path sampling - supplemented by trajectory umbrella sampling - we obtain the large deviation statistics of dynamical activity in the classical problem , and show the correspondence between the phase behaviour of the classical and quantum systems . the transition at the rk point between quantum phases of distinct order corresponds , in the classical case , to a trajectory phase transition between active and inactive dynamical phases . furthermore , from the structure of stochastic trajectories in the active dynamical phase we infer that the ground state of quantum dimers has columnar order to one side of the rk point . we discuss how these results relate to those from quantum monte carlo , and how our approach may generalise to other problems .
