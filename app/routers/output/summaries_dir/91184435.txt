for a black hole of schwarzschild radius $ a$ , we argue that the back - reaction of the vacuum energy - momentum tensor is in general important at the apparent horizon when the time scale of a process is larger than order $ a$. in particular , in a double - shell model , we show that the ignorance of the back - reaction leads to a divergence in the outgoing vacuum energy flux . the main result of this paper is that , once the back - reaction is included , the vacuum energy density for observers on top of the trapping horizon in vacuum is given by $ { \cal e } \simeq -1/2\ell_p^2 a^2 $ , which is of the same order of magnitude as the classical matter but opposite in sign . remarkably , this formula is independent of both the details about the collapsing matter and the vacuum energy - momentum tensor .
