precision control of a quantum system requires accurate determination of the effective system hamiltonian . we develop a method for estimating the hamiltonian parameters for some unknown two - state system and providing uncertainty bounds on these parameters . this method requires only one measurement basis and the ability to initialise the system in some arbitrary state which is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian in question . the scaling of the uncertainty is studied for large numbers of measurements and found to be proportional to one on the square - root of the number of measurements .
