the strength of optomechanical interactions in a cavity optomechanical system can be quantified by a vacuum coupling rate $ \vcr$ analogous to cavity quantum electrodynamics . this single figure of merit removes the ambiguity in the frequently quoted coupling parameter defining the frequency shift for a given mechanical displacement , and the effective mass of the mechanical mode . here we demonstrate and verify a straightforward experimental technique to derive the vacuum optomechanical coupling rate . it only requires applying a known frequency modulation of the employed electromagnetic probe field and knowledge of the mechanical oscillator 's occupation . the method is experimentally verified for a micromechanical mode in a toroidal whispering - gallery - resonator and a nanomechanical oscillator coupled to a toroidal cavity via its near field .
