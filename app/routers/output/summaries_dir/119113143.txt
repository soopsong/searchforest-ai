it has been realised that corners in entangling surfaces can induce new universal contributions to the entanglement entropy and r\'enyi entropy . in this paper we study universal corner contributions to entanglement negativity in three- and four - dimensional cfts using both field theory and holographic techniques . we focus on the quantity $ \chi$ defined by the ratio of the universal part of the entanglement negativity over that of the entanglement entropy , which may characterise the amount of distillable entanglement . we find that for most of the examples $ \chi$ takes bigger values for singular entangling regions , which may suggest increase in distillable entanglement . however , there also exist counterexamples where distillable entanglement decreases for singular surfaces . we also explore the behaviour of $ \chi$ as the coupling varies and observe that for singular entangling surfaces , the amount of distillable entanglement is mostly largest for free theories , while counterexample exists for free dirac fermion in three dimensions . for holographic cfts described by higher derivative gravity , $ \chi$ may increase or decrease , depending on the sign of the relevant parameters . our results may reveal a more profound connection between geometry and distillable entanglement .
