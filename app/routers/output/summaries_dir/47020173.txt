this paper demonstrates the use of entanglement resources in quantum speedup by presenting an algorithm which is the generalization of an algorithm proposed by goswami and panigrahi [ arxiv:1706.09489 ( 2017 ) ] . we generalize the algorithm and show that it provides deterministic solutions having an advantage over classical algorithm . the algorithm answers the question of whether a given function is constant or balanced and whether two functions are equal or unequal . finally , we experimentally verify the algorithm by using ibm 's five - qubit quantum computer with a high fidelity .
