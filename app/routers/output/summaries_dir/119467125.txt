an effective harmonic potential for photons is achieved in a photonic crystal structure , owing to the balance of the background dispersion and a bichromatic potential . consequently , ultra - compact resonators with several equi - spaced resonances and high loaded q factors ( 0.7 million ) are demonstrated . a detailed statistical analysis is carried out by exploiting the complex reflection spectra measured with optical coherent tomography . the log - normal distribution of the intrinsic q - factors peaks at 3 million . the device is made of $ ga_{0.5}in_{0.5}p$ in order to suppress the two photon absorption in the telecom spectral range considered here . this is crucial to turn the strong localization of light into ultra - efficient parametric interactions .
