a generalization of the stochastic wave function method to quantum master equations which are not in lindblad form is developed . the proposed stochastic unravelling is based on a description of the reduced system in a doubled hilbert space and it is shown , that this method is capable of simulating quantum master equations with negative transition rates . non - markovian effects in the reduced systems dynamics can be treated within this approach by employing the time - convolutionless projection operator technique . this ansatz yields a systematic perturbative expansion of the reduced systems dynamics in the coupling strength . several examples such as the damped jaynes cummings model and the spontaneous decay of a two - level system into a photonic band gap are discussed . the power as well as the limitations of the method are demonstrated .
