we investigate theoretically and experimentally a nondestructive interferometric measurement of the state population of an ensemble of laser cooled and trapped atoms . this study is a step towards generation of ( pseudo- ) spin squeezing of cold atoms targeted at the improvement of the caesium clock performance beyond the limit set by the quantum projection noise of atoms . we calculate the phase shift and the quantum noise of a near resonant optical probe pulse propagating through a cloud of cold 133cs atoms . we analyze the figure of merit for a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement of the collective pseudo - spin and show that it can be expressed simply as a product of the ensemble optical density and the pulse integrated rate of the spontaneous emission caused by the off - resonant probe light . based on this , we propose a protocol for the sequence of operations required to generate and utilize spin squeezing for the improved atomic clock performance via a qnd measurement on the probe light . in the experimental part we demonstrate that the interferometric measurement of the atomic population can reach the sensitivity of the order of n_at^1/2 in a cloud of n_at cold atoms , which is an important benchmark towards the experimental realisation of the theoretically analyzed protocol .
