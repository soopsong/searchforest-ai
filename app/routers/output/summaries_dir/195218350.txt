entanglement distillation is a key primitive for distributing high - quality entanglement between remote locations . probabilistic noiseless linear amplification based on the quantum scissors is a candidate for entanglement distillation from noisy continuous - variable ( cv ) entangled states . being a non - gaussian operation , quantum scissors is challenging to analyze . we present a derivation of the non - gaussian state heralded by multiple quantum scissors in a pure loss channel with two - mode squeezed vacuum input . we choose the reverse coherent information ( rci)---a proven lower bound on the distillable entanglement of a quantum state under one - way local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , as our figure of merit . we evaluate a gaussian lower bound on the rci of the heralded state . we show that it can exceed the unlimited two - way loccassisted direct transmission entanglement distillation capacity of the pure loss channel . the optimal heralded gaussian rci with two quantum scissors is found to be significantly more than that with a single quantum scissors , albeit at the cost of decreased success probability . our results fortify the possibility of a quantum repeater scheme for cv quantum states using the quantum scissors .
