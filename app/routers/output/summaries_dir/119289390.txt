the entangled behavior of different dimensional systems driven by classical external random field is investigated . the amount of the survival entanglement between the components of each system is quantified . there are different behaviors of entanglement that come into view decay , sudden death , sudden birth and long - lived entanglement . the maximum entangled states which can be generated from any of theses suggested systems are much fragile than the partially entangled ones . the systems of larger dimensions are more robust than those of smaller dimensions systems , where the entanglement decay smoothly , gradually and may vanish for a very short time . for the class of $ 2\times 3 $ dimensional system , the one parameter family is found to be more robust than the two parameters family . although the entanglement of driven $ 2 \times 3 $ dimensional system is very sensitive to the classical external random field , one can use them to generate a long - lived entanglement .
