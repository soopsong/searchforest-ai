continuous - wave squeezed states of light at the wavelength of 1550 nm have recently been demonstrated , but so far the obtained factors of noise suppression still lag behind today 's best squeezing values demonstrated at 1064 nm . here we report on the realization of a half - monolithic nonlinear resonator based on periodically - poled potassium titanyl phosphate which enabled the direct detection of up to 12.3 db of squeezing at 5 mhz . squeezing was observed down to a frequency of 2 khz which is well within the detection band of gravitational wave interferometers . our results suggest that a long - term stable 1550 nm squeezed light source can be realized with strong squeezing covering the entire detection band of a 3rd generation gravitational - wave detector such as the einstein telescope .
