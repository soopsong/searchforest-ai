when classically searching a database , having additional correct answers makes the search easier . for a discrete - time quantum walk searching a graph for a marked vertex , however , additional marked vertices can make the search harder by causing the system to approximately begin in a stationary state , so the system fails to evolve . in this paper , we completely characterize the stationary states , or 1-eigenvectors , of the quantum walk search operator for general graphs and configurations of marked vertices by decomposing their amplitudes into uniform and flip states . this infinitely expands the number of known stationary states and gives an optimization procedure to find the stationary state closest to the initial uniform state of the walk . we further prove theorems on the existence of stationary states , with them conditionally existing if the marked vertices form a bipartite connected component and always existing if non - bipartite . these results utilize the standard oracle in grover 's algorithm , but we show that a different type of oracle prevents stationary states from interfering with the search algorithm .
