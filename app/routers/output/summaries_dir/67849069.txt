the performance of open - system quantum annealing is adversely affected by thermal excitations out of the ground state . while the presence of energy gaps between the ground and excited states suppresses such excitations , error correction techniques are required to ensure full scalability of quantum annealing . quantum annealing correction ( qac ) is a method that aims to improve the performance of quantum annealers when control over only the problem ( final ) hamiltonian is possible , along with decoding . building on our earlier work [ s. matsuura et al . , phys . rev . lett . 116 , 220501 ( 2016 ) ] , we study qac using analytical tools of statistical physics by considering the effects of temperature and a transverse field on the penalty qubits in the ferromagnetic $ p$-body infinite - range transverse - field ising model . we analyze the effect of qac on second ( $ p=2 $ ) and first ( $ p\geq 3 $ ) order phase transitions , and construct the phase diagram as a function of temperature and penalty strength . our analysis reveals that for sufficiently low temperatures and in the absence of a transverse field on the penalty qubit , qac breaks up a single , large free energy barrier into multiple smaller ones . we find theoretical evidence for an optimal penalty strength in the case of a transverse field on the penalty qubit , a feature observed in qac experiments . our results provide further compelling evidence that qac provides an advantage over unencoded quantum annealing .
