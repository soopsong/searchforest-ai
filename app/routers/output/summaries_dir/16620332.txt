a quantum network is an open system consisting of several component markovian input - output subsystems interconnected by boson field channels carrying quantum stochastic signals . generalizing the work of chebotarev and gregoratti , we formulate the model description by prescribing a candidate hamiltonian for the network including details the component systems , the field channels , their interconnections , interactions and any time delays arising from the geometry of the network . ( we show that the candidate is a symmetric operator and proceed modulo the proof of self - adjointness . ) the model is non - markovian for finite time delays , but in the limit where these delays vanish we recover a markov model and thereby deduce the rules for introducing feedback into arbitrary quantum networks . the type of feedback considered includes that mediated by the use of beam splitters . we are therefore able to give a system - theoretic approach to introducing connections between quantum mechanical state - based input - output systems , and give a unifying treatment using non - commutative fractional linear , or mobius , transformations .
