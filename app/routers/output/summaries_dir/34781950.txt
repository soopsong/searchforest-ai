what is the minimal number of elements in a rank-1 positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) which can uniquely determine any pure state in $ d$-dimensional hilbert space $ \mathcal{h}_d$ ? the known result is that the number is no less than $ 3d-2$. we show that this lower bound is not tight except for $ d=2 $ or 4 . then we give an upper bound of $ 4d-3$. for $ d=2 $ , many rank-1 povms with four elements can determine any pure states in $ \mathcal{h}_2$. for $ d=3 $ , we show eight is the minimal number by construction . for $ d=4 $ , the minimal number is in the set of $ \{10,11,12,13\}$. we show that if this number is greater than 10 , an unsettled open problem can be solved that three orthonormal bases can not distinguish all pure states in $ \mathcal{h}_4$. for any dimension $ d$ , we construct $ d+2k-2 $ adaptive rank-1 positive operators for the reconstruction of any unknown pure state in $ \mathcal{h}_d$ , where $ 1\le k \le d$.
