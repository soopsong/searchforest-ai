quantum state transfer between different sites is a significant problem for quantum networks and quantum computers . by selecting quantum walks with two coins as the basic model and two coin spaces as the communication carriers , we successfully implement quantum state transfer on various graphs ( epl , \textbf{124 } ( 2018 ) 60009 ) \cite{shang_2019 } . here , we demonstrate the experimental implementation of this scheme using ibm quantum experience platform . in particular , we show the transfer of bell state , ghz state and w state on complete graph on the quantum device . also , we observe that our protocol has high fidelity by preforming quantum state tomography .
