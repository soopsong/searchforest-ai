we demonstrate a technique based on invariants of motion for a time - dependent hamiltonian , allowing a fast transition to a final state identical in theory to that obtained through a perfectly adiabatic transformation . this method is experimentally applied to the fast decompression of an ultracold cloud of rubidium 87 atoms held in a harmonic magnetic trap , in the presence of gravity . we are able to decompress the trap by a factor of 15 within 35 ms with a strong suppression of the sloshing and breathing modes induced by the large vertical displacement and curvature reduction of the trap . when compared to a standard linear decompression , we achieve a gain of a factor of 37 on the transition time .
