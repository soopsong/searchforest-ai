in this article we use optimal control to maximize the efficiency of a quantum heat engine executing the otto cycle in the presence of external noise . we optimize the engine performance for both amplitude and phase noise . in the case of phase damping we additionally show that the ideal performance of a noiseless engine can be retrieved in the adiabatic ( long time ) limit . the results obtained here are useful in the quest for absolute zero , the design of quantum refrigerators that can cool a physical system to the lowest possible temperature . they can also be applied to the optimal control of a collection of classical harmonic oscillators sharing the same time - dependent frequency and subjected to similar noise mechanisms . finally , our methodology can be used for the optimization of other interesting thermodynamic processes .
