qutrit ( or ternary ) structures arise naturally in many quantum systems , particularly in certain non - abelian anyon systems . we present efficient circuits for ternary reversible and quantum arithmetics . our main result is the derivation of circuits for two families of ternary quantum adders , namely ripple carry adders and carry look - ahead adders . the main difference to the binary case is the more complicated form of the ternary carry , which leads to higher resource counts for implementations over a universal ternary gate set . our ternary ripple adder circuit has a circuit depth of $ o(n)$ and uses only $ 1 $ ancilla , making it more efficient in both , circuit depth and width than previous constructions . our ternary carry lookahead circuit has a circuit depth of only $ o(\log\,n)$ , while using with $ o(n)$ ancillas . our approach works on two levels of abstraction : at the first level , descriptions of arithmetic circuits are given in terms of gates sequences that use various types of non - clifford reflections . at the second level , we break down these reflections further by deriving them either from the two - qutrit clifford gates and the non - clifford gate $ c(x ) : |i , j\rangle \mapsto |i , j + \delta_{i,2 } \mod 3\rangle$ or from the two - qutrit clifford gates and the non - clifford gate $ p_9=\mbox{diag}(e^{-2 \pi \ , i/9},1,e^{2 \pi \ , i/9})$. the two choices of elementary gate sets correspond to two possible mappings onto two different prospective quantum computing architectures which we call the metaplectic and the supermetaplectic basis , respectively . finally , we develop a method to factor diagonal unitaries using multi - variate polynomial over the ternary finite field which allows to characterize classes of gates that can be implemented exactly over the supermetaplectic basis .
