particular complexity of linear quantum optical networks is deserved recently certain attention due to possible implications for theory of quantum computation . two relevant models of bosons are discussed in presented work . symmetric product of hilbert spaces produces rather abstract model . the second one is obtained by quantization of harmonic oscillator . in contrast to considered bosonic processes , so - called"fermionic linear optics"is effectively simulated on classical computer . the comparison of bosonic and fermionic case clarifies the controversy and the more elaborated oscillator model provides a deeper analogy .
