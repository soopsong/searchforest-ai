we exploit the separation of the filtering and control aspects of quantum feedback control to consider the optimal control as a classical stochastic problem on the space of quantum states . we derive the corresponding hamilton - jacobi - bellman equations using the elementary arguments of classical control theory and show that this is equivalent , in the stratonovich calculus , to a stochastic hamilton - pontryagin setup . we show that , for cost functionals that are linear in the state , the theory yields the traditional bellman equations treated so far in quantum feedback .
