the techniques employed to solve the interaction of a detector and a quantum field typically require perturbation methods . we introduce mathematical techniques to solve the time evolution of an arbitrary number of detectors interacting with a quantum field . our techniques apply to harmonic oscillator detectors and can be generalized to treat detectors modeled by quantum fields . since the interaction hamiltonian we introduce is quadratic in creation and annihilation operators , we are able to draw from continuous variable techniques commonly employed in quantum optics .
