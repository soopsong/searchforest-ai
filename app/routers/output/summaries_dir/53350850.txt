we develop a thermally tunable hybrid photonic platform comprising gallium arsenide ( gaas ) photonic crystal cavities , silicon nitride ( sin$_x$ ) grating couplers and waveguides , and chromium ( cr ) microheaters on an integrated photonic chip . the gaas photonic crystal cavities are evanescently connected to a common bus waveguide , separating the computation and communication layers . the microheaters are designed to continuously and reversibly tune distant photonic crystal cavities to a common resonance . this architecture can be implemented in a coherent optical network for dedicated optical computing and machine learning .
