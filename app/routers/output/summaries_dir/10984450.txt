we present an algorithm , along with its implementation that finds t - optimal approximations of single - qubit z - rotations using quantum circuits consisting of clifford and t gates . our algorithm is capable of handling errors in approximation down to size $ 10^{-15}$ , resulting in optimal single - qubit circuit designs required for implementation of scalable quantum algorithms . our implementation along with the experimental results are available in the public domain .
