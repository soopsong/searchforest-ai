we address the issue of quantifying the non - gaussian character of a bosonic quantum state and introduce a non - gaussianity measure based on the hilbert - schmidt distance between the state under examination and a reference gaussian state . we analyze in details the properties of the proposed measure and exploit it to evaluate the non - gaussianity of some relevant single- and multi - mode quantum states . the evolution of non - gaussianity is also analyzed for quantum states undergoing the processes of gaussification by loss and de - gaussification by photon - subtraction . the suggested measure is easily computable for any state of a bosonic system and allows to define a corresponding measure for the non - gaussian character of a quantum operation .
