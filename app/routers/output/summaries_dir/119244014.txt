we propose a global measure for quantum correlations in multipartite systems , which is obtained by suitably recasting the quantum discord in terms of relative entropy and local von neumann measurements . the measure is symmetric with respect to subsystem exchange and is shown to be non - negative for an arbitrary state . as an illustration , we consider tripartite correlations in the werner - ghz state and multipartite correlations at quantum criticality . in particular , in contrast with the pairwise quantum discord , we show that the global quantum discord is able to characterize the infinite - order quantum phase transition in the ashkin - teller spin chain .
