we show how macroscopically distinct quantum superposition states ( schroedinger cat states ) may be used as logical qubit encodings for the correction of spontaneous emission errors . spontaneous emission causes a bit flip error which is easily corrected by a standard error correction circuit . the method works arbitrarily well as the distance between the amplitudes of the superposed coherent states increases .
