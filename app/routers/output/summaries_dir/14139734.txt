we present the reconstruction of the wigner function of a classical phase - sensitive state , a pulsed coherent state , by measurements of the distributions of detected - photons of the state displaced by a coherent probe field . by using a hybrid photodetector operated above its photon - resolving regime , we obtained both the statistics at different values of the probe field and the values of the probe phase required to reconstruct the wigner function .
