in a bayesian analysis , the likelihood that specific candidate parameters govern the evolution of a quantum system are conditioned on the outcome of measurements which , in turn , cause measurement backaction on the state of the system [ m. tsang , phys . rev . lett . 108 , 170502 ( 2012 ) ] . specializing to the distinction of two candidate hypotheses , we study the achievements of continuous monitoring of the radiation emitted by a quantum system followed by an optimal projective measurement on its conditioned final state . our study of the radiative decay of a driven two - level system shows an intricate interplay between the maximum information available from photon counting and homodyne detection and the final projective measurement on the emitter . we compare the results with theory predicting a lower bound for the probability to assign a wrong hypothesis by any combined measurement on the system and its radiative environment .
