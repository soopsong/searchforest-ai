two systems whose correlations can not be classically accounted for display the simplest instance of quantum entanglement . although this two - party association has caused a revolution in the foundations and uses of quantum mechanics , genuine entanglement among several parties unveils a whole new class of phenomena and applications . in this work we suggest a way to prepare dicke states from a tunable source of bipartite entanglement to investigate foundational issues . the scheme has the following distinctive features : ( i ) it relies on controlled information loss and { \it unentangled } measurements ; ( ii ) irrespective of the source entanglement , whenever a dicke state is produced , it is ideal ; ( iii ) the optimal entanglement of the bipartite source undergoes a second - order - like transition depending on the parameters of the dicke state to be produced . these properties lead to asymptotic results on the entanglement between any qubit belonging to a dicke state and the remaining qubits .
