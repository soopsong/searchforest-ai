we consider a photo -- carnot engine that consists of a single -- mode radiation field in an optical cavity . one the heat reservoirs is made of a beam of thermally entangled pairs of two -- level atoms that interact resonantly with the cavity . we express the thermodynamic efficiency of the engine in terms of the quantum discord of the atomic pair and find that it can exceed its classical value . our results show that useful work can be extracted from quantum correlations , indicating that the latter are a valuable resource in quantum thermodynamics .
