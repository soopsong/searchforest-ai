long - distance quantum communication networks require appropriate interfaces between matter qubit - based nodes and low - loss photonic quantum channels . we implement a downconversion quantum interface , where the single photons emitted from a semiconductor quantum dot at 910 nm are downconverted to 1560 nm using a fiber - coupled periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide and a 2.2-$\mu$m pulsed pump laser . the single - photon character of the quantum dot emission is preserved during the downconversion process : we measure a cross - correlation $ g^{(2)}(\tau = 0 ) = 0.17 $ using resonant excitation of the quantum dot . we show that the downconversion interface is fully compatible with coherent optical control of the quantum dot electron spin through the observation of rabi oscillations in the downconverted photon counts . these results represent a critical step towards a long - distance hybrid quantum network in which subsystems operating at different wavelengths are connected through quantum frequency conversion devices and 1.5-$\mu$m quantum channels .
