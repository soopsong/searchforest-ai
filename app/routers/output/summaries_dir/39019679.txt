schemes to achieve strong coupling between mechanical modes of aluminum nitride microstructures and microwave cavity modes due to the piezoelectric effect are proposed . we show that the strong coupling regime is feasible for an on - chip aluminum nitride device that is either enclosed by a three - dimensional microwave cavity or integrated with a superconducting coplanar resonator . combining with optomechanics , the piezomechanical strong coupling permits coherent conversion between microwave and optical modes with high efficiency . hence , the piezomechanical system will be an efficient transducer for applications in hybrid quantum systems .
