recently , the gaussian optimizer conjecture in quantum information theory was confirmed for bosonic gaussian gauge - covariant or contravariant channels . these results use the i.i.d . model of the quantum noise . in this paper we consider quantum gaussian signal+noise model with time - continuous stationary coloured noise . a proof of the coding theorem for the classical capacity of quantum broadband gauge - covariant gaussian channels is given . we also discuss and compare the"broadband"and the"bandpass"models of time - continuous time - continuous stationary coloured noise .
