the active harnessing of quantum resources in engineered quantum devices poses unprecedented requirements on device control . besides the residual interaction with the environment , causing environment - induced decoherence , uncontrolled parameters in the system itself -- disorder -- remains as a substantial factor limiting precision and thus performance of devices . these perturbations may arise , for instance , due to imperfect sample production , stray fields , or finite accuracy of control electronics . disorder - dressed quantum evolution means a unifying framework , based on quantum master equations , to analyze how these detrimental influences cause deviations from the desired system dynamics . such description may thus contribute to unveil and mitigate disorder effects towards robust schemes . to demonstrate the broad scope of this framwork , we evalute two distinct scenarios : a central spin immersed in an isotropic spin bath , and a random mass dirac particle .
