using the paradigm of information backflow to characterize a non - markovian evolution , we introduce so - called precursors of non - markovianity , i.e. necessary properties that the system and environment state must exhibit at earlier times in order for an ensuing dynamics to be non - markovian . in particular , we consider a quantitative framework to assess the role that established system - environment correlations together with changes in environmental states play in an emerging non - markovian dynamics . by defining the relevant contributions in terms of the bures distance , which is conveniently expressed by means of the quantum state fidelity , these quantities are well defined and easily applicable to a wide range of physical settings . we exemplify this by studying our precursors of non - markovianity in discrete and continuous variable non - markovian collision models .
