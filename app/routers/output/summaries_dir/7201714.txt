this article is motivated by the observation , that calculations of the unruh effect based on idealized particle detectors are usually made in a way that involves integrations along the { \em entire } detector trajectory up to the infinitely remote { \em future } . we derive an expression which allows time - dependence of the detector response in the case of a non - stationary trajectory and conforms more explicitely to the principle of causality , namely that the response at a given instant of time depends only on the detectors { \em past } movements . on trying to reproduce the thermal unruh spectrum we are led to an unphysical result , which we trace down to the use of the standard regularization $ t\to t - i\eps$ of the correlation function . by consistently employing a rigid detector of finite extension , we are led to a different regularization which works fine with our causal response function .
