we show that the temperature of a cavity field can be drastically varied by its interaction with suitably - entangled atom pairs ( dimers ) traversing the cavity under realistic atomic decoherence . to this end we resort to the hitherto untapped resource of naturally entangled dimers whose state can be simply controlled via molecular dissociation , collisions forming the dimer , or unstable dimers such as positronium . depending on the chosen state of the dimer , the cavity - field mode can be driven to a steady - state temperature that is either much lower or much higher than the ambient temperature , despite adverse effects of cavity loss and atomic decoherence . entangled dimers enable much broader range of cavity temperature control than single ` phaseonium ' atoms with coherently - superposed levels . such dimers are shown to constitute highly caloric fuel that can ensure high efficiency or power in photonic thermal engines . alternatively , they can serve as controllable thermal baths for quantum simulation of energy exchange in photosynthesis or quantum annealing .
