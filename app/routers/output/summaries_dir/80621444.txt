adiabatic quantum control is a very important approach for quantum physics and quantum information processing . it holds the advantage with robustness to experimental imperfections but accumulates more decoherence due to the long evolution time . here , we propose a universal protocol for fast and robust quantum control in multimode interactions of a quantum system by using shortcuts to adiabaticity . the results show this protocol can speed up the evolution of a multimode quantum system effectively , and it can also keep the robustness very good while adiabatic quantum control processes can not . we apply this protocol for the quantum state transfer in quantum information processing in the photon - phonon interactions in an optomechanical system , showing a perfect result . these good features make this protocol have the capability of improving effectively the feasibility of the practical applications of multimode interactions in quantum information processing in experiment .
