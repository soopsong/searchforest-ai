in the study of quantum limits to parameter estimation , the high dimensionality of the density operator and that of the unknown parameters have long been two of the most difficult challenges . here i propose a theory of quantum semiparametric estimation that can circumvent both challenges for a class of problems and produce simple analytic quantum bounds , even when the dimensions are arbitrarily high and little prior information about the density operator is assumed . the theory is especially relevant to the estimation of a parameter that can be expressed as a function of the density operator , such as the mean of an observable , the fidelity to a pure state , the purity , or the von neumann entropy . potential applications include quantum state characterization and optical imaging .
