a convergence theorem is obtained for quantum random walks with particles in an arbitrary normal state . this result unifies and extends previous work on repeated - interactions models , including that of the author ( 2010 , j. london math . soc . ( 2 ) 81 , 412 - 434 ; 2010 , comm . math . phys . 300 , 317 - 329 ) . when the random - walk generator acts by ampliation and multiplication or conjugation by a unitary operator , necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the quantum stochastic cocycle which arises in the limit to be driven by an isometric , co - isometric or unitary process .
