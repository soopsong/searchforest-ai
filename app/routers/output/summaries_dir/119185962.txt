we propose a circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) realization of a protocol to generate a greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state for $ n$ superconducting transmon qubits homogeneously coupled to a superconducting transmission line resonator in the dispersive limit . we derive an effective hamiltonian with pairwise qubit exchange interactions of the xy type , $ \tilde{g}(xx+yy)$ , that can be globally controlled . starting from a separable initial state , these interactions allow to generate a multi - qubit ghz state within a time $ t_{\text{ghz}}\sim \tilde{g}^{-1}$. we discuss how to probe the non - local nature and the genuine $ n$-partite entanglement of the generated state . finally , we investigate the stability of the proposed scheme to inhomogeneities in the physical parameters .
