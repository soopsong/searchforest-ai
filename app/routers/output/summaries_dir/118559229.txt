we study how heralded qubit losses during the preparation of a two - dimensional cluster state , a universal resource state for one - way quantum computation , affect its computational power . above the percolation threshold we present a polynomial - time algorithm that concentrates a universal cluster state , using resources that scale optimally in the size of the original lattice . on the other hand , below the percolation threshold , we show that single qubit measurements on the faulty lattice can be efficiently simulated classically . we observe a phase transition at the threshold when the amount of entanglement in the faulty lattice directly relevant to the computational power changes exponentially .
