basic properties of uhlmann 's partial fidelities are discussed . statistical interpretation in terms of povm measurements is established . multiplicativity properties are considered . the relationship between partial fidelities and partitioned trace distances is derived . as it is shown , the partial fidelities can not decrease under unistochastic quantum operations . thus , the partial fidelities have good properties in the sense of their use as distinguishability measures .
