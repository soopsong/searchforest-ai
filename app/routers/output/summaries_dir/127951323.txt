this paper presents a physics - based model for the threshold voltage in bulk mosfets valid from room down to cryogenic temperature ( 4.2 k ) . the proposed model is derived from poisson 's equation including bandgap widening , intrinsic carrier - density scaling , and incomplete ionization . we demonstrate that accounting for incomplete ionization in the expression of the threshold voltage is critical for an accurate estimation of the current . the model is validated with our experimental results from nmosfets of a 28-nm cmos process . the developed model is a key element for a cryo - cmos compact model and can serve as a guide to optimize processes for high - performance cryo - computing and ultra - low - power quantum computing .
