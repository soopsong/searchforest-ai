we investigate theoretically the model of a cavity - quantum - electrodynamics ( qed ) system that consists of two two - level atoms coupled to a single - mode cavity in the weak coupling regime , where the system is driven by quantum light . the dynamics behavior of the entire system is tackled in the framework of a cascaded quantum system . we find that the two - photon blockade with two - photon bunching and three - photon antibunching can be obtained even when the strong system dissipation is included . this result shows that our work has potential for realizing entangled photon pairs in a weakly coupled cavity . moreover , we also analyze the photon statistics of the system in the case of out - of - resonance coupling between cavity and two nonidentical atoms . here , an unconventional photon blockade effect with the suppression of two - photon correlation and enhancement of three - photon correlation can be realized , which shows many quantum statistical characteristics of cavity qed system in weak coupling .
