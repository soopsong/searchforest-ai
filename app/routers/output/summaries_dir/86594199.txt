we address quantum decision theory as a convenient framework to analyze process discrimination and estimation in qubit systems . in particular we discuss the following problems : i ) how to discriminate whether or not a given unitary perturbation has been applied to a qubit system ; ii ) how to determine the amplitude of the minimum detectable perturbation . in order to solve the first problem , we exploit the so - called bayes strategy , and look for the optimal measurement to discriminate , with minimum error probability , whether or not the unitary transformation has been applied to a given signal . concerning the second problem , the strategy of neyman and pearson is used to determine the ultimate bound posed by quantum mechanics to the minimum detectable amplitude of the qubit transformation . we consider both pure and mixed initial preparations of the qubit , and solve the corresponding binary decision problems . we also analyze the use of entangled qubits in the estimation protocol and found that entanglement , in general , improves stability rather than precision . finally , we take into account the possible occurrence of different kinds of background noise and evaluate the corresponding effects on the discrimination strategies .
