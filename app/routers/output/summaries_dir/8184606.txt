we study quantum communication in the presence of adversarial noise . in this setting , communicating with perfect fidelity requires using a quantum code of bounded minimum distance , for which the best known rates are given by the quantum gilbert - varshamov ( qgv ) bound . by asking only for arbitrarily high fidelity and allowing the sender and reciever to use a secret key with length logarithmic in the number of qubits sent , we achieve a dramatic improvement over the qgv rates . in fact , we find protocols that achieve arbitrarily high fidelity at noise levels for which perfect fidelity is impossible . to achieve such communication rates , we introduce fully quantum list codes , which may be of independent interest .
