joint or simultaneous measurements of non - commuting quantum observables are possible at the cost of increased unsharpness or measurement uncertainty . many different criteria exist for defining what an"optimal"joint measurement is , with corresponding different tradeoff relations for the measurements . understanding the limitations of such measurements is of fundamental interest and relevant for quantum technology . here , we experimentally test a tradeoff relation for the sharpness of qubit measurements , a relation which refers directly to the form of the measurement operators , rather than to errors in estimates . we perform the first optical implementation of the simplest possible optimal joint measurement , requiring less quantum resources than have previously often been employed . using a heralded single - photon source , we demonstrate quantum - limited performance of the scheme on single quanta .
