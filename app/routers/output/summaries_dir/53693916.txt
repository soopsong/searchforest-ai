we investigate theoretically the dynamics of the system that consists of a cascade three - level emitter interacting with a single - mode resonator in the deep - strong - coupling regime . we show that the dynamical evolution of the system can only occur in a certain parity chain decided by the initial state , in which the photon population and the initial state probability present periodic collapses and revivals . in particular , we find that the evolution of the dynamics can be controlled by feeding the time - control pulses into the system . control pluses with specific arrival times can suddenly switch off and on the time evolutions of the system populations and initial state probability when the system is originally in a symmetry superposition state . physically , the switch - off of the evolution originates from the symmetry - breaking of the state , i.e , $ ( |g0\rangle+|f0\rangle)/\sqrt{2}\rightarrow(|g0\rangle-|f0\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$. this work offers an all - optical approach to manipulate the dynamics of the system , which might have potential application in modern quantum technology .
