in the coming years , the gravitational wave community will be optimizing detector performance for a variety of astrophysical sources that make competing demands on the detector sensitivity in different frequency bands . in this paper we describe a number of technologies that are being developed as anticipated upgrades to the advanced ligo detector , and quantify the potential sensitivity improvement they offer . specifically , we consider squeezed light injection for reduction of quantum noise , detector design and materials changes which reduce thermal noise , and mirrors with significantly increased mass . we explore how each of these technologies impacts the detection of the most promising gravitational wave sources , and suggest an effective progression of upgrades which culminate in a factor of two broadband sensitivity improvement .
