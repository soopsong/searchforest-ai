quantum state transfer between cavities is crucial for quantum information processing and quantum computation in optomechanical systems . here , we present the first scheme for the transitionless intra - cavity quantum state transfer based on transitionless quantum driving ( tqd ) algorithm in optomechanical systems . we also present a physically feasible system for the tqd process based on largely detuned optomechanical cavity . with the gaussian time - dependence coupling strengths , our scheme can achieve the perfect quantum state transfer with no undesired transition and reduce the dependence of accurately controlling evolution time and interval of coupling strengths . our computational results show that the tqd process can be accomplished with no need of the mechanical oscillator in its ground state and is also robust to the mechanical dissipation .
