a systematic approach to the non - markovian quantum dynamics of open systems is given by the projection operator techniques of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics . combining these methods with concepts from quantum information theory and from the theory of positive maps , we derive a class of correlated projection superoperators that take into account in an efficient way statistical correlations between the open system and its environment . the result is used to develop a generalization of the lindblad theory to the regime of highly non - markovian quantum processes in structured environments .
