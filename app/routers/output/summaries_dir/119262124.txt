conventional tomographic techniques are becoming increasingly infeasible for reconstructing the operators of quantum devices of growing sophistication . we describe a novel tomographic procedure using coherent states which begins by reconstructing the diagonals of the operator , and then each successive off - diagonal in a recursive manner . each recursion is considerably more efficient than reconstructing the operator in its entirety , and each successive recursion involves fewer parameters . we apply our technique to reconstruct the positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) corresponding to a recently developed coherent optical detector with phase sensitivity and number resolution . we discuss the effect of various parameters on the reconstruction accuracy . the results show the efficiency of the method and its robustness to experimental noise .
