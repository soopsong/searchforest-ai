we analyze theoretically the measurement of the mean output work and its fluctuations in a recently proposed optomechanical quantum heat engine [ k. zhang { \it et al . } phys . rev . lett . { \bf112 } , 150602 ( 2014 ) ] . after showing that this work can be evaluated by a continuous measurements of the intracavity photon number we discuss both dispersive and absorptive measurement schemes and analyze their back - action effects on the efficiency of the engine . both measurements are found to reduce the efficiency of the engine , but their back - action is both qualitatively and quantitatively different . for dispersive measurements the efficiency decreases as a result of the mixing of photonic and phononic excitations , while for absorptive measurements , its reduction results from photon losses due to the interaction with the quantum probe .
