we investigate an experimentally feasible scheme for amplification of superpositions of coherent states ( scss ) in light fields . this scheme mixes two input scss at a 50:50 beam splitter and performs post - selection by a homodyne detection on one output mode . the key idea is to use two different types of scss with opposite parities for input states , which results in an amplified output scs with a nearly perfect fidelity .
