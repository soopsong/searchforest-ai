we investigate the use of twin - mode quantum states of light with symmetric statistical features in their photon number for improving intensity - sensitive surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) sensors . for this purpose , one of the modes is sent into a prism setup where the kretschmann configuration is employed as a sensing platform and the analyte to be measured influences the spr excitation conditions . this influence modifies the output state of light that is subsequently analyzed by an intensity - difference measurement scheme . we show that quantum noise reduction is achieved not only as a result of the sub - poissonian statistical nature of a single mode , but also as a result of the non - classical correlation of the photon number between the two modes . when combined with the high sensitivity of the spr sensor , we show that the use of twin - mode quantum states of light notably enhances the estimation precision of the refractive index of an analyte . with this we are able to identify a clear strategy to further boost the performance of spr sensors , which are already a mature technology in biochemical and medical sensing applications .
