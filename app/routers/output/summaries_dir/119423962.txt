in this paper we present a perturbative procedure that allows one to numerically solve diffusive non - markovian stochastic schr\"odinger equations , for a wide range of memory functions . to illustrate this procedure numerical results are presented for a classically driven two level atom immersed in a environment with a simple memory function . it is observed that as the order of the perturbation is increased the numerical results for the ensembled average state $ \rho_{\rm red}(t)$ approach the exact reduced state found via imamo\=glu 's enlarged system method [ phys . rev . a. 50 , 3650 ( 1994 ) ] .
