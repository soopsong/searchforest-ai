we describe the hardware , gateware , and software developed at raytheon bbn technologies for dynamic quantum information processing experiments on superconducting qubits . in dynamic experiments , real - time qubit state information is fedback or fedforward within a fraction of the qubits ' coherence time to dynamically change the implemented sequence . the hardware presented here covers both control and readout of superconducting qubits . for readout we created a custom signal processing gateware and software stack on commercial hardware to convert pulses in a heterodyne receiver into qubit state assignments with minimal latency , alongside data taking capability . for control , we developed custom hardware with gateware and software for pulse sequencing and steering information distribution that is capable of arbitrary control flow on a fraction superconducting qubit coherence times . both readout and control platforms make extensive use of fpgas to enable tailored qubit control systems in a reconfigurable fabric suitable for iterative development .
