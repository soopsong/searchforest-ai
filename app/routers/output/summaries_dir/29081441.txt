concurrence , as one of entanglement measures , is a useful tool to characterize quantum entanglement in various quantum systems . however , the computation of the concurrence involves difficult optimizations and only for the case of two qubits an exact formula was found . we investigate the concurrence of four - qubit quantum states and derive analytical lower bound of concurrence using the multiqubit monogamy inequality . it is shown that this lower bound is able to improve the existing bounds . this approach can be generalized to arbitrary qubit systems . we present an exact formula of concurrence for some mixed quantum states . for even - qubit states , we derive an improved lower bound of concurrence using a monogamy equality for qubit systems . at the same time , we show that a multipartite state is $ k$-nonseparable if the multipartite concurrence is larger than a constant related to the value of $ k$ , the qudit number and the dimension of the subsystems . our results can be applied to detect the multipartite $ k$-nonseparable states .
