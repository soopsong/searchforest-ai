quantum walks , in virtue of the coherent superposition and quantum interference , possess exponential superiority over its classical counterpart in applications of quantum searching and quantum simulation . the quantum enhanced power is highly related to the state space of quantum walks , which can be expanded by enlarging the photon number and/or the dimensions of the evolution network , but the former is considerably challenging due to probabilistic generation of single photons and multiplicative loss . here we demonstrate a two - dimensional continuous - time quantum walk by using the external geometry of photonic waveguide arrays , rather than the inner degree of freedoms of photons . using femtosecond laser direct writing , we construct a large - scale three - dimensional structure which forms a two - dimensional lattice with up to 49x49 nodes on a photonic chip . we demonstrate spatial two - dimensional quantum walks using heralded single photons and single - photon - level imaging . we analyze the quantum transport properties via observing the ballistic evolution pattern and the variance profile , which agree well with simulation results . we further reveal the transient nature that is the unique feature for quantum walks of beyond one dimension . an architecture that allows a walk to freely evolve in all directions and a large scale , combining with defect and disorder control , may bring up powerful and versatile quantum walk machines for classically intractable problems .
