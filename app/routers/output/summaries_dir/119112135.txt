the large deviation theory has recently been applied to open quantum systems to uncover dynamical crossovers in the space of quantum trajectories associated to markovian evolutions . such dynamical crossovers are characterized by qualitative changes in the fluctuations of rare quantum jump trajectories , and have been observed in the statistics of coherently driven quantum systems . in this article we investigate the counting statistics of rare quantum trajectories of an undriven system undergoing a pure relaxation process , namely , markovian exciton transport . we find that dynamical crossovers occur in systems with a minimum of three interacting molecules , and are strongly activated by exciton delocalization and interference . our results illustrate how quantum features of the underlying system hamiltonian can influence the statistical properties of energy transfer processes in a non - trivial manner .
