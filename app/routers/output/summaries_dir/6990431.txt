in previous work , we have developed a dynamic learning paradigm for"programming"a general quantum computer . a learning algorithm is used to find a set of parameters for a coupled qubit system such that the system at an initial time evolves to a state in which a given measurement results in the desired calculation value . this can be thought of as a quantum neural network ( qnn ) . here , we apply our method to a system of three qubits , and demonstrate training the quantum computer to estimate both pairwise and three - way entanglement .
