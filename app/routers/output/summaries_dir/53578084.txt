the principle of superposition is a key ingredient for quantum mechanics . a recent work [ m. oszmaniec et al . , phys . rev . lett . 116 , 110403 ( 2016 ) ] has shown that a quantum adder that deterministically generates a superposition of two unknown states is forbidden . here we propose a probabilistic approach for creating a superposition state of two arbitrary states encoded in two three - dimensional cavities . our implementation is based on a three - level superconducting transmon qubit dispersively coupled to two cavities . numerical simulations show that high - fidelity generation of the superposition of two coherent states is feasible with current circuit qed technology . our method also works for other physical systems such as other types of superconducting qubits , natural atoms , quantum dots , and nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers .
