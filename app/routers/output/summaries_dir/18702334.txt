we investigate the semigroup structure of bosonic gaussian quantum channels . particular focus lies on the sets of channels which are divisible , idempotent or markovian ( in the sense of either belonging to one - parameter semigroups or being infinitesimal divisible ) . we show that the non - compactness of the set of gaussian channels allows for remarkable differences when comparing the semigroup structure with that of finite dimensional quantum channels . for instance , every irreversible gaussian channel is shown to be divisible in spite of the existence of gaussian channels which are not infinitesimal divisible . a simpler and known consequence of non - compactness is the lack of generators for certain reversible channels . along the way we provide new representations for classes of gaussian channels : as matrix semigroup , complex valued positive matrices or in terms of a simple form describing almost all one - parameter semigroups .
