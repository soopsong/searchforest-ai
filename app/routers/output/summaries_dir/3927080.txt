we analyse the minimum quantum resources needed to realise strong non - locality , as exemplified e.g. by the classical ghz construction . it was already known that no two - qubit system , with any finite number of local measurements , can realise strong non - locality . for three - qubit systems , we show that strong non - locality can only be realised in the ghz slocc class , and with equatorial measurements . however , we show that in this class there is an infinite family of states which are pairwise non - lu - equivalent that realise strong non - locality with finitely many measurements . these states have decreasing entanglement between one qubit and the other two , necessitating an increasing number of local measurements on the latter .
