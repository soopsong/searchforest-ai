the existence of non - local quantum correlations is certainly the most important specific property of the quantum world . however , it is a challenging task to distinguish correlations of classical origin from genuine quantum correlations , especially when the system involves more than two parties , for which different partitions must be simultaneously considered . in the case of mixed states , intermediate levels of correlations must be introduced , coined by the name inseparability . in this work , we revisit in more detail such a concept in the context of continuous - variable quantum optics . we consider a six - partite quantum state that we have effectively generated by the parametric downconversion of a femtosecond frequency comb , the full 12 x 12 covariance matrix of which has been experimentally determined . we show that , though this state does not exhibit"genuine entanglement " , it is undoubtedly multipartite - entangled . the consideration of not only the entanglement of individual mode - decompositions but also of combinations of those solves the puzzle and exemplifies the importance of studying different categories of multipartite entanglement .
