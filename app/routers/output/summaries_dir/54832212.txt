we present a theoretical study of a hybrid circuit - qed system composed of two semiconducting charge - qubits confined in a microwave resonator . the qubits are defined in terms of the charge states of two spatially separated double quantum dots ( dqds ) which are coupled to the same photon mode in the microwave resonator . we analyze a transport setup where each dqd is attached to electronic reservoirs and biased out - of - equilibrium by a large voltage , and study how electron transport across each dqd is modified by the coupling to the common resonator . in particular , we show that the inelastic current through each dqd reflects an indirect qubit - qubit interaction mediated by off - resonant photons in the microwave resonator . as a result of this interaction , both charge qubits stay entangled in the steady ( dissipative ) state . finite shot noise cross - correlations between currents across distant dqds are another manifestation of this nontrivial steady - state entanglement .
