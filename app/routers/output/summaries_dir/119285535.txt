we present a constructive control scheme for solving quantum state engineering problems based on a parametrization of the state vector in terms of complex hyperspherical coordinates . unlike many control schemes based on factorization of unitary operators the scheme gives explicit expressions for all the euler angles in terms of the hyperspherical coordinates of the initial and final state . the factorization , when applicable , has added benefits that phase rotations can be combined and performed concurrently . the control procedure can be realized using a simple bang - bang or square - wave - function controls . optimal time - energy control is considered to find the optimal control amplitudes . the extension of the scheme to implement unitary operators is also discussed .
