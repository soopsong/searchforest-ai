work and quantum correlations are two fundamental resources in thermodynamics and quantum information theory . in this work we study how to use correlations among quantum systems to optimally store work . we analyse this question for isolated quantum ensembles , where the work can be naturally divided into two contributions : a local contribution from each system , and a global contribution originating from correlations among systems . we focus on the latter and consider quantum systems which are locally thermal , thus from which any extractable work can only come from correlations . we compute the maximum extractable work for general entangled states , separable states , and states with fixed entropy . our results show that while entanglement gives an advantage for small quantum ensembles , this gain vanishes for a large number of systems .
