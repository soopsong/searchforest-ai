we propose a protocol that enables strong coupling between a flux qubit and the quantized motion of a magnetized nanomechanical cantilever . the flux qubit is driven by microwave fields with suitable parameters to induce sidebands , which will lead to the desired coupling . we show that the nanomechanical modes can be cooled to the ground states and the single - mode squeezed vacuum states can be generated via fast dissipation of the flux qubit . in our scheme , the qubit decay plays a positive role and can help drive the system to the target states .
