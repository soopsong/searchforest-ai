we describe a quantum algorithm to prepare an arbitrary pure state of a register of a quantum computer with fidelity arbitrarily close to 1 . our algorithm is based on grover 's quantum search algorithm . for sequences of states with suitably bounded amplitudes , the algorithm requires resources that are polynomial in the number of qubits . such sequences of states occur naturally in the problem of encoding a classical probability distribution in a quantum register .
