a new class of modified theories of gravity , consisting of the superposition of the metric einstein - hilbert lagrangian with an $ f(\cal r)$ term constructed \`{a } la palatini was proposed recently . the dynamically equivalent scalar - tensor representation of the model was also formulated , and it was shown that even if the scalar field is very light , the theory passes the solar system observational constraints . therefore the model predicts the existence of a long - range scalar field , modifying the cosmological and galactic dynamics . an explicit model that passes the local tests and leads to cosmic acceleration was also obtained . in the present work , it is shown that the theory can be also formulated in terms of the quantity $ x\equiv \kappa^2 t+r$ , where t and r are the traces of the stress - energy and ricci tensors , respectively . the variable x represents the deviation with respect to the field equation trace of general relativity . the cosmological applications of this hybrid metric - palatini gravitational theory are also explored , and cosmological solutions coming from the scalar - tensor representation of f(x)-gravity are presented . criteria to obtain cosmic acceleration are discussed and the field equations are analyzed as a dynamical system . several classes of dynamical cosmological solutions , depending on the functional form of the effective scalar field potential , describing both accelerating and decelerating universes are explicitly obtained . furthermore , the cosmological perturbation equations are derived and applied to uncover the nature of the propagating scalar degree of freedom and the signatures these models predict in the large - scale structure .
