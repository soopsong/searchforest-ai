we study entanglement properties of mixed density matrices obtained from combinatorial laplacians . this is done by introducing the notion of the density matrix of a graph . we characterize the graphs with pure density matrices and show that the density matrix of a graph can be always written as a uniform mixture of pure density matrices of graphs . we consider the von neumann entropy of these matrices and we characterize the graphs for which the minimum and maximum values are attained . we then discuss the problem of separability by pointing out that separability of density matrices of graphs does not always depend on the labelling of the vertices . we consider graphs with a tensor product structure and simple cases for which combinatorial properties are linked to the entanglement of the state . we calculate the concurrence of all graph on four vertices representing entangled states . it turns out that for some of these graphs the value of the concurrence is exactly fractional .
