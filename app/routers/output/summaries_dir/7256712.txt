there exists a variety of proposals to transform a conventional s - wave superconductor into a topological superconductor , supporting majorana fermion mid - gap states . a necessary ingredient of these proposals is strong spin - orbit coupling . here we propose an alternative system consisting of a one - dimensional chain of magnetic nanoparticles on a superconducting substrate . no spin - orbit coupling in the superconductor is needed . we calculate the topological quantum number of a chain of finite length , including the competing effects of disorder in the orientation of the magnetic moments and in the hopping energies , to identify the transition into the topologically nontrivial state ( with majorana fermions at the end points of the chain ) .
