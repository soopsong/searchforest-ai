we demonstrate a new construction for perfect quantum secret sharing ( qss ) schemes based on imperfect"ramp"secret sharing combined with classical encryption , in which the individual parties ' shares are split into quantum and classical components , allowing the former to be of lower dimension than the secret itself . we show that such schemes can be performed with smaller quantum components and lower overall quantum communication than required for existing methods . we further demonstrate that one may combine both imperfect quantum and imperfect classical secret sharing to produce an overall perfect qss scheme , and that examples of such scheme ( which we construct ) can have the smallest quantum and classical share components possible for their access structures , something provably not achievable using perfect underlying schemes . our construction has significant potential for being adapted to other qss schemes based on stabiliser codes .
