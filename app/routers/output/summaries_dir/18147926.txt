given a graph $ g=(v , e)$ , a subset $ b\subseteq v$ of vertices is a weak odd dominated ( wod ) set if there exists $ d \subseteq v { \setminus } b$ such that every vertex in $ b$ has an odd number of neighbours in $ d$. $ \kappa(g)$ denotes the size of the largest wod set , and $ \kappa'(g)$ the size of the smallest non - wod set . the maximum of $ \kappa(g)$ and $ |v|-\kappa'(g)$ , denoted $ \kappa_q(g)$ , plays a crucial role in quantum cryptography . in particular deciding , given a graph $ g$ and $ k>0 $ , whether $ \kappa_q(g)\le k$ is of practical interest in the design of graph - based quantum secret sharing schemes . the decision problems associated with the quantities $ \kappa$ , $ \kappa'$ and $ \kappa_q$ are known to be np - complete . in this paper , we consider the approximation of these quantities and the parameterized complexity of the corresponding problems . we mainly prove the fixed - parameter intractability ( w$[1]$-hardness ) of these problems . regarding the approximation , we show that $ \kappa_q$ , $ \kappa$ and $ \kappa'$ admit a constant factor approximation algorithm , and that $ \kappa$ and $ \kappa'$ have no polynomial approximation scheme unless p = np .
