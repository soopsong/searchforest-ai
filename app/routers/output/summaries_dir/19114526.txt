although the conditions for performing arbitrary unitary operations to simulate the dynamics of a closed quantum system are well understood , the same is not true of the more general class of quantum operations ( also known as superoperators ) corresponding to the dynamics of open quantum systems . we propose a framework for the generation of markovian quantum dynamics and study the resources needed for universality . for the case of a single qubit , we show that a single nonunitary process is necessary and sufficient to generate all unital markovian quantum dynamics , whereas a set of processes parametrized by one continuous parameter is needed in general . we also obtain preliminary results for the unital case in higher dimensions .
