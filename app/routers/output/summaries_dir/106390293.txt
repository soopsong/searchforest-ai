in a recent experiment , barreiro et al . demonstrated the fundamental building blocks of an open - system quantum simulator with trapped ions [ nature 470 , 486 ( 2011 ) ] . using up to five ions , single- and multi - qubit entangling gate operations were combined with optical pumping in stroboscopic sequences . this enabled the implementation of both coherent many - body dynamics as well as dissipative processes by controlling the coupling of the system to an artificial , suitably tailored environment . this engineering was illustrated by the dissipative preparation of entangled two- and four - qubit states , the simulation of coherent four - body spin interactions and the quantum non - demolition measurement of a multi - qubit stabilizer operator . in the present paper , we present the theoretical framework of this gate - based ( " digital " ) simulation approach for open - system dynamics with trapped ions . in addition , we discuss how within this simulation approach minimal instances of spin models of interest in the context of topological quantum computing and condensed matter physics can be realized in state - of - the - art linear ion - trap quantum computing architectures . we outline concrete simulation schemes for kitaev 's toric code hamiltonian and a recently suggested color code model . the presented simulation protocols can be adapted to scalable and two - dimensional ion - trap architectures , which are currently under development .
