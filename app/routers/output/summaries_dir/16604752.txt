in this paper , we present a new exact algorithm for counting perfect matchings , which relies on neither inclusion - exclusion principle nor tree - decompositions . for any bipartite graph of $ 2n$ nodes and $ \delta n$ edges such that $ \delta \geq 3 $ , our algorithm runs with $ o^{\ast}(2^{(1 - 1 / o(\delta \log \delta))n})$ time and exponential space . compared to the previous algorithms , it achieves a better time bound in the sense that the performance degradation to the increase of $ \delta$ is quite slower . the main idea of our algorithm is a new reduction to the problem of computing the cut - weight distribution of the input graph . the primary ingredient of this reduction is macwilliams identity derived from elementary coding theory . the whole of our algorithm is designed by combining that reduction with a non - trivial fast algorithm computing the cut - weight distribution . to the best of our knowledge , the approach posed in this paper is new and may be of independent interest .
