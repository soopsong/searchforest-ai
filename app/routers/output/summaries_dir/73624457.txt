two of the most intriguing features of quantum physics are the uncertainty principle and the occurrence of nonlocal correlations . the uncertainty principle states that there exist pairs of incompatible measurements on quantum systems such that their outcomes can not both be predicted . on the other hand , nonlocal correlations of measurement outcomes at different locations can not be explained by classical physics , but appear in the presence of entanglement . here , we show that these two fundamental quantum effects are quantitatively related . namely , we provide an entropic uncertainty relation for the outcomes of two binary measurements , where the lower bound on the uncertainty is quantified in terms of the maximum clauser - horne - shimony - holt value that can be achieved with these measurements . we discuss applications of this uncertainty relation in quantum cryptography , in particular , to certify quantum sources using untrusted devices .
