memoryless time evolutions are ubiquitous in nature but often correspond to a resolution - induced approximation , i.e. there are correlations in time whose effects are undetectable . recent advances in the dynamical control of small quantum systems provide the ideal scenario to probe some of these effects . here we experimentally demonstrate the precise induction of memory effects on the evolution of a quantum coin ( qubit ) by correlations engineered in its environment . in particular , we design a collisional model in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and precisely control the strength of the effects by changing the degree of correlation in the environment and its time of interaction with the qubit . we also show how these effects can be hidden by the limited resolution of the measurements performed on the qubit . the experiment reinforces nmr as a test bed for the study of open quantum systems and the simulation of their classical counterparts .
