this paper proposes a numerical method for solving time - dependent schrodinger equations with finite spectral bandwidth , which applies to both periodic and non - periodic cases . we introduce the concept of pulse width modulation ( pwm ) , which is broadly used in classical control engineering , to simulate time - dependent quantum dynamics by switching between a finite number of constant hamiltonians . the switching timings can be programmed to improve the precision and save computational resources . the effectiveness of the pwm method is demonstrated by numerical simulations , which shows that it is faster and more robust than the standard piecewise constant control systems . moreover , we also propose the realization of pwm method for potential implementation in experimental systems .
