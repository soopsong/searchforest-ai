regular quasiprobabilities are introduced for the aim of characterizing quantum correlations of multimode radiation fields . negativities of these quantum - correlation quasiprobabilities are necessary and sufficient for any quantum correlation encoded in the multimode glauber - sudarshan p function . the strength of the method is demonstrated for a two - mode phase randomized squeezed - vacuum state . it has no entanglement , no quantum discord , a positive wigner function , and a classical reduced single - mode representation . our method clearly visualizes the quantum correlations of this state .
