the nonlinear quantum regime is crucial for implementing interesting quantum effects , which have wide applications in modern quantum science . here we propose an effective method to reach the nonlinear quantum regime in a modulated optomechanical system ( oms ) , which is originally in the weak - coupling regime . the mechanical spring constant and optomechanical interaction are modulated periodically . this leads to the result that the resonant optomechanical interaction can be effectively enhanced into the single - photon strong - coupling regime by the modulation - induced mechanical parametric amplification . moreover , the amplified phonon noise can be suppressed completely by introducing a squeezed vacuum reservoir , which ultimately leads to the realization of photon blockade in a weakly coupled oms . the reached nonlinear quantum regime also allows us to engineer the nonclassical states ( e.g. , schr\"{o}dinger cat states ) of cavity field , which are robust against the phonon noise . this work offers an alternative approach to enhance the quantum nonlinearity of an oms , which should expand the applications of cavity optomechanics in the quantum realm .
