ultrathin optical fibres integrated into cold atom setups are proving to be ideal building blocks for atom - photon hybrid quantum networks . such optical nanofibres ( onf ) can be used for the demonstration of nonlinear optics and quantum interference phenomena in atomic media . here , we report on the observation of multilevel cascaded electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) using an optical nanofibre to interface cold $ ^{87}$rb atoms through the intense evanescent fields that can be achieved at ultralow probe and coupling powers . both the probe ( at 780 nm ) and the coupling ( at 776 nm ) beams propagate through the nanofibre . the observed multipeak transparency spectra of the probe beam could offer a method for simultaneously slowing down multiple wavelengths in an optical nanofibre or for generating onf - guided entangled beams , showing the potential of such an atom - nanofibre system for quantum information . we also demonstrate all - optical - switching in the all fibred system using the obtained eit effect .
