in this work we study a family of bosonic lattice models that combine an on - site repulsion term with a nearest - neighbor pairing term , $ \sum_{<i , j > } a^\dagger_i a^\dagger_j + \mathrm{h.c.}$ like the original bose - hubbard model , the nearest - neighbor term is responsible for the mobility of bosons and it competes with the local interaction , inducing two - mode squeezing . however , unlike a trivial hopping , the counter - rotating terms form pairing can not be studied with a simple mean - field theory and does not present a quantum phase transition in phase space . instead , we show that there is a cross - over from a pure insulator to long - range correlations that start up as soon as the two - mode squeezing is switched on . we also show how this model can be naturally implemented using coupled microwave resonators and superconducting qubits .
