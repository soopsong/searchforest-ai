we describe a feasible logic bell - state analysis protocol by employing the logic entanglement to be the robust concatenated greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( c - ghz ) state . this protocol only uses polarization beam splitters and half - wave plates , which are available in current experimental technology . we can conveniently identify two of the logic bell states . this protocol can be easily generalized to the arbitrary c - ghz state analysis . we can also distinguish two $ n$-logic - qubit c - ghz states . as the previous theory and experiment both showed that the c - ghz state has the robustness feature , this logic bell - state analysis and c - ghz state analysis may be essential for linear - optical quantum computation protocols whose building blocks are logic - qubit entangled state .
