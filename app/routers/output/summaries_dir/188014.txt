we consider entanglement harvesting in de sitter space using a model of multiple qubit detectors . we obtain the formula of the entanglement negativity for this system . applying the obtained formula , we find that it is possible to access to the entanglement on the super horizon scale if sufficiently large number of detectors are prepared . this result indicates the effect of the multipartite entanglement is crucial for detection of large scale entanglement in de sitter space .
