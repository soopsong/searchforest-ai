boson - sampling has attracted much interest as a simplified approach to implementing a subset of optical quantum computing . boson - sampling requires indistinguishable photons , but far fewer of them than universal optical quantum computing architectures . in reality , photons are never indistinguishable , and exhibit a rich spectral structure . here we consider the operation of boson - sampling with photons of arbitrary spectral structure and relate the sampling statistics of the device to matrix permanents . this sheds light on the computational complexity of different regimes of the photons ' spectral characteristics , and provides very general results for the operation of linear optics interferometers in the presence of partially distinguishable photons . our results apply to both the cases of spectrally resolving and non - spectrally resolving detectors .
