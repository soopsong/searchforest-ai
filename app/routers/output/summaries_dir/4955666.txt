we consider a spin chain of fermionic atoms in an optical lattice , interacting with each other by super - exchange interactions . we theoretically investigate the dissipative evolution of the spin chain when it is coupled by magnetic dipole - dipole interaction to a bath consisting of atoms with a strong magnetic moment . dipolar interactions with the bath allow for a dynamical evolution of the collective spin of the spin chain . starting from an uncorrelated thermal sample , we demonstrate that the dissipative cooling produces highly entangled low energy spin states of the chain in a timescale of a few seconds . in practice , the lowest energy singlet state driven by super - exchange interactions is efficiently produced . this dissipative approach is a promising alternative to cool spin - full atoms in spin - independent lattices . it provides direct thermalization of the spin degrees of freedom , while traditional approaches are plagued by the inherently long timescale associated to the necessary spatial redistribution of spins under the effect of super - exchange interactions .
