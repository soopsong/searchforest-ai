in this paper , we investigate theoretically the quantum state transfer in a laser driven hybrid optomechanical cavity with two duffing - like anharmonic movable end mirrors containing an ensemble of identical two - level trapped atoms . the quantum state transfer from the bogoliubov modes of the two anharmonic oscillators to the atomic mode results in the atomic quadrature squeezing beyond the standard quantum limit of 3 db which can be controlled by both the optomechanical and atom - field coupling strengths . interestingly , the generated atomic squeezing can be made robust against the noise sources by means of the duffing anharmonicity . moreover , the results reveal that the presence of the duffing anharmonicity provides the possibility of transferring strongly squeezed states between the two mechanical oscillators in a short operating time and with a high fidelity .
