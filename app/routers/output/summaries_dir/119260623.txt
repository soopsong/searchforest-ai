we propose to use a cryogenic nonlinear resonator for the projective readout , classical memory , and feedback for a superconducting qubit . this approach sidesteps many of the inefficiencies inherent in two - way communication between temperature stages in typical systems with room temperature controllers , and avoids increasing the cryogenic heat load . this controller may find a broad range of uses in multi - qubit systems , but here we analyze two specific demonstrative cases in single qubit - control . in the first case , the nonlinear controller is used to initialize the qubit in a definite eigenstate . and in the second case , the qubit 's state is read into the controller 's classical memory , where it is stored for an indefinite period of time , and then used to reinstate the measured state after the qubit has decayed . we analyze the properties of this system and we show simulations of the time evolution for the full system dynamics .
