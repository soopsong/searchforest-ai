the hermiticity axiom of quantum mechanics guarantees that the energy spectrum is real and the time evolution is unitary ( probability - preserving ) . nevertheless , non - hermitian but $ \mathcal{pt}$-symmetric hamiltonians may also have real eigenvalues . systems described by such effective $ \mathcal { pt}$-symmetric hamiltonians have been realized in experiments using coupled systems with balanced loss ( dissipation ) and gain ( amplification ) , and their corresponding classical dynamics has been studied . a $ \mathcal { pt}$-symmetric system emerging from a quantum dynamics is highly desirable , in order to understand what $ \mathcal { pt}$-symmetry and the powerful mathematical and physical concepts around it will bring to the next generation of quantum technologies . here , we address this need by proposing and studying a circuit - qed architecture that consists of two coupled resonators and two qubits ( each coupled to one resonator ) . by means of external driving fields on the qubits , we are able to tune gain and losses in the resonators . starting with the quantum dynamics of this system , we show the emergence of the $ \mathcal { pt}$-symmetry via the selection of both driving amplitudes and frequencies . we engineer the system such that a non - number conserving dipole - dipole interaction emerges , introducing an instability at large coupling strengths . the $ \mathcal { pt}$-symmetry and its breaking , as well as the predicted instability in this circuit - qed system can be observed in a transmission experiment .
