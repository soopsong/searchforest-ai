optical nanofibres are increasingly being used in cold atom experiments due to their versatility and the clear advantages they have when developing all - fibred systems for quantum technologies . they provide researchers with a method of overcoming the rayleigh range for achieving high intensities in a focussed beam over a relatively long distance , and can act as a noninvasive tool for probing cold atoms . in this review article , we will briefly introduce the theory of mode propagation in an ultrathin optical fibre and highlight some of the more significant theoretical and experimental progresses to date , including the early work on atom probing , manipulation and trapping , the study of atom - dielectric surface interactions , and the more recent observation of nanofibre - mediated nonlinear optics phenomena in atomic media . the functionality of optical nanofibres in relation to the realisation of atom - photon hybrid quantum systems is also becoming more evident as some of the earlier technical challenges are surpassed and , recently , several schemes to implement optical memories have been proposed . we also discuss some possible directions where this research field may head , in particular in relation to the use of optical nanofibres that can support higher - order modes with an associated orbital angular momentum .
