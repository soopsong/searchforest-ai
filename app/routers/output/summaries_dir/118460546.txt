we engineer the fast rotation of a quantum particle confined in an effectively one - dimensional , harmonic trap , for a predetermined rotation angle and time , avoiding final excitation . different schemes are proposed with different speed limits that depend on the control capabilities . we also make use of trap rotations to create squeezed states without manipulating the trap frequencies .
