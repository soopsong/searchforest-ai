we present an accreditation protocol for the outputs of noisy intermediate - scale quantum devices . by testing entire circuits rather than individual gates , our accreditation protocol can provide an upper - bound on the variation distance between noisy and noiseless probability distribution of the outputs of the target circuit of interest . our accreditation protocol requires implementation of quantum circuits no larger than the target circuit , therefore it is practical in the near term and scalable in the long term . inspired by trap - based protocols for the verification of quantum computations , our accreditation protocol assumes that noise in single - qubit gates is bounded ( but potentially gate - dependent ) in diamond norm . we allow for arbitrary spatial and temporal correlations in the noise affecting state preparation , measurements and two - qubit gates . we describe how to implement our protocol on real - world devices , and we also present a novel cryptographic protocol ( which we call ` mesothetic ' protocol ) inspired by our accreditation protocol .
