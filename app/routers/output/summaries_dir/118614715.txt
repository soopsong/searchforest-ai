we show how the choice of an inflationary state that entangles scalar and tensor fluctuations affects the angular two - point correlation functions of the $ t$ , $ e$ , and $ b$ modes of the cosmic microwave background . the propagators for a state starting with some general quadratic entanglement are solved exactly , leading to predictions for the primordial scalar - scalar , tensor - tensor , and scalar - tensor power spectra . these power spectra are expressed in terms of general functions that describe the entangling structure of the initial state relative to the standard bunch - davies vacuum . we illustrate how such a state would modify the angular correlations in the cmb with a simple example where the initial state is a small perturbation away from the bunch - davies state . because the state breaks some of the rotational symmetries , the angular power spectra no longer need be strictly diagonal .
