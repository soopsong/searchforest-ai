the creation of high - performance narrowband filters is of great interest for many rf - signal processing applications . to this end , numerous schemes for electronic , mems - based , and microwave photonic filters have been demonstrated . filtering schemes based on microwave photonic systems offer superior flexibility and tunability to traditional rf filters . however , these optical - based filters are typically limited to ghz - widths and often have large rf insertion losses , posing challenges for integration into high - fidelity radiofrequency circuits . in this article , we demonstrate a novel type of microwave filter that combines the attractive features of microwave photonic filters with high - q phononic signal processing using a photonic - phononic emit - receive process . through this process , a rf signal encoded on a guided optical wave is transduced onto a ghz - frequency acoustic wave , where it may be filtered through shaping of acoustic transfer functions before being re - encoded onto a spatially separate optical probe . this emit - receive functionality , realized in an integrated silicon waveguide , produces mhz - bandwidth band - pass filtering while supporting low rf insertion losses necessary for high dynamic range in a microwave photonic link . we also demonstrate record - high internal efficiency for emit - receive operations of this type , and show that the emit - receive operation is uniquely suitable for the creation of serial filter banks with minimal loss of fidelity . this photonic - phononic emitter - receiver represents a new method for low - distortion signal - processing in an integrated all - silicon device .
