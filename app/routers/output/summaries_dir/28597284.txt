we experimentally demonstrated entanglement extraction scheme by using photons at the telecommunication band for optical - fiber - based quantum communications . we generated two pairs of non - degenerate polarization entangled photons at 780~nm and 1551~nm by spontaneous parametric down - conversion and distributed the two photons at 1551~nm through a collective phase damping channel which gives the same amount of random phase shift on the two photons . through local operation and classical communication , we extracted an entangled photon pair from two phase - disturbed photon pairs . an observed fidelity of the extracted photon pair to a maximally entangled photon pair was 0.73 $ \pm$ 0.07 which clearly shows the recovery of entanglement .
