we derive some entanglement properties of the ground states of two classes of quantum spin chains described by the fredkin model , for half - integer spins , and the motzkin model , for integer ones . since the ground states of the two models are known analytically , we can calculate the entanglement entropy , the negativity and the quantum mutual information exactly . we show , in particular , that these systems exhibit long - distance entanglement , namely two disjoint regions of the chains remain entangled even when the separation is sent to infinity , i.e. these systems are not affected by decoherence . this strongly entangled behavior , occurring both for colorful versions of the models ( with spin larger than 1/2 or 1 , respectively ) and for colorless cases ( spin 1/2 and 1 ) , is consistent with the violation of the cluster decomposition property . moreover we show that this behavior involves disjoint segments located both at the edges and in the bulk of the chains .
