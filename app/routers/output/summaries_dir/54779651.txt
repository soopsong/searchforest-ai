we report results important for the creation of a best - of - both - worlds quantum hybrid system consisting of a solid - state source of single photons and an atomic ensemble as quantum memory . we generate single photons from a gaas quantum dot ( qd ) frequency - matched to the rb d2-transitions and then use the rb transitions to analyze spectrally the quantum dot photons . we demonstrate lifetime - limited qd linewidths ( 1.48 ghz ) with both resonant and non - resonant excitation . the qd resonance fluorescence in the low power regime is dominated by rayleigh scattering , a route to match quantum dot and rb atom linewidths and to shape the temporal wave packet of the qd photons . noise in the solid - state environment is relatively benign : there is a blinking of the resonance fluorescence at mhz rates but negligible upper state dephasing of the qd transition . we therefore establish a close - to - ideal solid - state source of single photons at a key wavelength for quantum technologies .
