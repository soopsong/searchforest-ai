beyond their use as numerical tools , quantum trajectories can be ascribed a degree of reality in terms of quantum measurement theory . in fact , they arise naturally from considering continuous observation of a damped quantum system . a particularly useful form of quantum trajectories is as linear ( but non - unitary ) stochastic schrodinger equations . in the limit where a strong local oscillator is used in the detection , and where the system is not driven , these quantum trajectories can be solved . this gives an alternate derivation of the probability distributions for completed homodyne and heterodyne detection schemes . it also allows the previously intractable problem of real - time adaptive measurements to be treated . the results for an analytically soluble example of adaptive phase measurements are presented , and future developments discussed .
