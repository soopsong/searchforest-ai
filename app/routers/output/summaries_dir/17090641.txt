the holevo capacity of an arbitrarily constrained infinite dimensional quantum channel is considered and its properties are discussed . the notion of optimal average state is introduced . the continuity properties of the holevo capacity with respect to constraint and to the channel are explored.the main result of this paper is the statement that additivity of the holevo capacity for all finite dimensional channels implies its additivity for all infinite dimensional channels with arbitrary constraints .
