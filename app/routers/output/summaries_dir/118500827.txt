we studied the quantum correlations between the nodes in a quantum neural network built of an array of quantum dots with dipole - dipole interaction . by means of the quasiadiabatic path integral simulation of the density matrix evolution in a presence of the common phonon bath we have shown the coherence in such system can survive up to the liquid nitrogen temperature of 77k and above . the quantum correlations between quantum dots are studied by means of calculation of the entanglement of formation in a pair of quantum dots with the typical dot size of a few nanometers and the interdot distance of the same order . we have shown that the proposed quantum neural network can keep the mixture of entangled states of qd pairs up to the above mentioned high temperatures .
