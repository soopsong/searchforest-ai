we investigate the capabilities of loss - tolerant quantum state characterization using a photon - number resolving , time - multiplexed detector ( tmd ) . we employ the idea of probing the wigner function point - by - point in phase space via photon parity measurements and displacement operations , replacing the conventional homodyne tomography . our emphasis lies on reconstructing the wigner function of non - gaussian fock states with highly negative values in a scheme that is based on a realistic experimental setup . in order to establish the concept of loss - tolerance for state characterization we show how losses can be decoupled from the impact of other experimental imperfections , i.e. the non - unity transmittance of the displacement beamsplitter and non - ideal mode overlap . we relate the experimentally accessible parameters to effective ones that are needed for an optimised state reconstruction . the feasibility of our approach is tested by monte carlo simulations , which provide bounds resulting from statistical errors that are due to limited data sets . our results clearly show that high losses can be accepted for a defined parameter range , and moreover , that ( in contrast to homodyne detection ) mode mismatch results in a distinct signature , which can be evaluated by analysing the photon number oscillations of the displaced fock states .
