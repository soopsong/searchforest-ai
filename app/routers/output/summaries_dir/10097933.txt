in this work we present a quantum key distribution protocol using continuous - variable non - gaussian states , homodyne detection and post - selection . the employed signal states are the photon added then subtracted coherent states ( pascs ) in which one photon is added and subsequently one photon is subtracted . we analyze the performance of our protocol , compared to a coherent state based protocol , for two different attacks that could be carried out by the eavesdropper ( eve ) . we calculate the secret key rate transmission in a lossy line for a superior channel ( beam - splitter ) attack , and we show that we may increase the secret key generation rate by using the non - gaussian pascs rather than coherent states . we also consider the simultaneous quadrature measurement ( intercept - resend ) attack and we show that the efficiency of eve 's attack is substantially reduced if pascs are used as signal states .
