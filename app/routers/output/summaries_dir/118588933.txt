we present two entanglement concentration protocols ( ecps ) for arbitrary three - electron w state based on their charges and spins . different from other ecps , in both two ecps , with the help of the electronic polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) and charge detection , the less - entangled w state can be concentrated into a maximally entangled state only with some single charge qubits . the second ecp is more optimal than the first one , for by constructing the complete parity check gate , the second ecp can be used repeatedly to further concentrate the less - entangled state and obtain a higher success probability . therefore , both the ecps , especially the second one may be useful in current quantum information processing .
