in [ berta 2014 entanglement ] , uncertainty relations in the presence of quantum memory was formulated for mutually unbiased bases using conditional collision entropy . in this paper , we generalize their results to the mutually unbiased measurements . our primary result is an equality between the amount of uncertainty for a set of measurements and the amount of entanglement of the measured state , both of which are quantified by the conditional collision entropy . implications of this equality relation are discussed . we further show that similar equality relation can be obtained for generalized symmetric informationally complete measurements . we also derive an interesting equality for arbitrary orthogonal basis of the space of hermitian , traceless operators .
