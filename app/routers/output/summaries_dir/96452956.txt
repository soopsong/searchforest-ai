we compute the effect of markovian bulk dephasing noise on the staggered magnetization of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg chain , as the system evolves after a n\'eel quench . for sufficiently weak system - bath coupling , the unitary dynamics are found to be preserved up to a single exponential damping factor . this is a consequence of the interplay between $ \mathbb{pt}$ symmetry and weak symmetries , which strengthens previous predictions for $ \mathbb{pt}$-symmetric liouvillian dynamics . requirements are a non - degenerate $ \mathbb{pt}$-symmetric generator of time evolution $ \hat{\mathcal{l}}$ , a weak parity symmetry and an observable that is anti - symmetric under this parity transformation . the spectrum of $ \hat{\mathcal{l}}$ then splits up into symmetry sectors , yielding the same decay rate for all modes that contribute to the observable 's time evolution . this phenomenon may be realized in trapped ion experiments and has possible implications for the control of decoherence in out - of - equilibrium many - body systems .
