we discuss the interior of a black hole in quantum gravity , in which black holes form and evaporate unitarily . the interior spacetime appears in the sense of complementarity because of special features revealed by the microscopic degrees of freedom when viewed from a semiclassical standpoint . the relation between quantum mechanics and the equivalence principle is subtle , but they are still consistent .
