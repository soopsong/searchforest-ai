in the typical spatial search problems solved by continuous - time quantum walk , changing the location of the marked vertices does not alter the search problem . in this paper , we consider search when this is no longer true . in particular , we analytically solve search on the"simplex of $ k_m$ complete graphs"with all configurations of two marked vertices , two configurations of $ m+1 $ marked vertices , and two configurations of $ 2(m+1)$ marked vertices , showing that the location of the marked vertices can dramatically influence the required jumping rate of the quantum walk , such that using the wrong configuration 's value can cause the search to fail . this sensitivity to the jumping rate is an issue unique to continuous - time quantum walks that does not affect discrete - time ones .
