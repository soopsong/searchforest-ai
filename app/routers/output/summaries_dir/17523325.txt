we present an analysis of wiesner 's quantum money scheme , as well as some natural generalizations of it , based on semidefinite programming . for wiesner 's original scheme , it is determined that the optimal probability for a counterfeiter to create two copies of a bank note from one , where both copies pass the bank 's test for validity , is ( 3/4)^n for n being the number of qubits used for each note . generalizations in which other ensembles of states are substituted for the one considered by wiesner are also discussed , including a scheme recently proposed by pastawski , yao , jiang , lukin , and cirac , as well as schemes based on higher dimensional quantum systems . in addition , we introduce a variant of wiesner 's quantum money in which the verification protocol for bank notes involves only classical communication with the bank . we show that the optimal probability with which a counterfeiter can succeed in two independent verification attempts , given access to a single valid n - qubit bank note , is ( 3/4+sqrt(2)/8)^n . we also analyze extensions of this variant to higher - dimensional schemes .
