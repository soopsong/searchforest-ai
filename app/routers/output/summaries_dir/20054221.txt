we consider the weyl quantum walk in 3 + 1 dimensions , that is a discrete - time walk describing a particle with two internal degrees of freedom moving on a cayley graph of the group $ \mathbb z^3 $ , that in an appropriate regime evolves according to weyl 's equation . the weyl quantum walk was recently derived as the unique unitary evolution on a cayley graph of $ \mathbb z^3 $ that is homogeneous and isotropic . the general solution of the quantum walk evolution is provided here in the position representation , by the analytical expression of the propagator , i.e. transition amplitude from a node of the graph to another node in a finite number of steps . the quantum nature of the walk manifests itself in the interference of the paths on the graph joining the given nodes . the solution is based on the binary encoding of the admissible paths on the graph and on the semigroup structure of the walk transition matrices .
