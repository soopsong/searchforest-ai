there is currently significant interest in operating devices in the quantum regime , where their behaviour can not be explained through classical mechanics . quantum states , including entangled states , are fragile and easily disturbed by excessive thermal noise . here we address the question of whether it is possible to create non - reciprocal devices that encourage the flow of thermal noise towards or away from a particular quantum device in a network . our work makes use of the cascaded systems formalism to answer this question in the affirmative , showing how a three - port device can be used as an effective thermal transistor , and illustrates how this formalism maps onto an experimentally - realisable optomechanical system . our results pave the way to more resilient quantum devices and to the use of thermal noise as a resource .
