the entanglement entropy in many gapless quantum systems receives a contribution from corners in the entangling surface in 2 + 1d . it is characterized by a universal function $ a(\theta)$ depending on the opening angle $ \theta$ , and contains pertinent low energy information . for conformal field theories ( cfts ) , the leading expansion coefficient in the smooth limit $ \theta \to \pi$ yields the stress tensor 2-point function coefficient $ c_t$ . little is known about $ a(\theta)$ beyond that limit . here , we show that the next term in the smooth limit expansion contains information beyond the 2- and 3-point correlators of the stress tensor . we conjecture that it encodes 4-point data , making it much richer . further , we establish strong constraints on this and higher order smooth - limit coefficients . we also show that $ a(\theta)$ is lower - bounded by a non - trivial function multiplied by the central charge $ c_t$ , e.g. $ a(\pi/2 ) \geq ( \pi^2 \ln 2)c_t /6$. this bound for 90-degree corners is nearly saturated by all known results , including recent numerics for the interacting wilson - fisher quantum critical points ( qcps ) . a bound is also given for the r\'enyi entropies . we illustrate our findings using o(n ) qcps , free boson and dirac fermion cfts , strongly coupled holographic ones , and other models . exact results are also given for lifshitz quantum critical points , and for conical singularities in 3 + 1d .
