entanglement is a key issue in the quantum physics which gives rise to resources for achieving tasks that are not possible within the realm of classical physics . quantum entanglement varies with the evolution of the quantum systems . it is of significance to investigate the entanglement dynamics in terms of quantum channels . we study the entanglement - breaking channels and present the necessary and sufficient conditions for a quantum channel to an entanglement - breaking one for qubit systems . furthermore , a concept of strong entanglement - breaking channel is introduced . the amendment of entanglement - breaking channels is also studied .
