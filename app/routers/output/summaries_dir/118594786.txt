it is impossible to unambiguously distinguish the four bell states in polarization , resorting to linear optical elements only . recently , the hyperentangled bell state , the simultaneous entanglement in more than one degree of freedom , has been used to assist in the complete bell - state analysis of the four bell states . however , if the additional degree of freedom is qubitlike , one can only distinguish 7 from the group of 16 states . here we present a way to distinguish the hyperentangled bell states completely with the help of cross - kerr nonlinearity . also , we discuss its application in the quantum teleportation of a particle in an unknown state in two different degrees of freedom and in the entanglement swapping of hyperentangled states . these applications will increase the channel capacity of long - distance quantum communication .
