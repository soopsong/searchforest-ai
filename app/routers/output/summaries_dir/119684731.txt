in this paper we explore the set of linear maps sending the set of quantum gaussian states into itself . these maps are in general not positive , a feature which can be exploited as a test to check whether a given quantum state belongs to the convex hull of gaussian states ( if one of the considered maps sends it into a non positive operator , the above state is certified not to belong to the set ) . generalizing a result known to be valid under the assumption of complete positivity , we provide a characterization of these gaussian - to - gaussian ( not necessarily positive ) superoperators in terms of their action on the characteristic function of the inputs . for the special case of one - mode mappings we also show that any gaussian - to - gaussian superoperator can be expressed as a concatenation of a phase - space dilatation , followed by the action of a completely positive gaussian channel , possibly composed with a transposition . while a similar decomposition is shown to fail in the multi - mode scenario , we prove that it still holds at least under the further hypothesis of homogeneous action on the covariance matrix .
