continuous variable remote state preparation and teleportation are analyzed using wigner functions in phase space . we suggest a remote squeezed state preparation scheme between two parties sharing an entangled twin beam , where homodyne detection on one beam is used as a conditional source of squeezing for the other beam . the scheme works also with noisy measurements , and provide squeezing if the homodyne quantum efficiency is larger than 50 % . phase space approach is shown to provide a convenient framework to describe teleportation as a generalized conditional measurement , and to evaluate relevant degrading effects , such the finite amount of entanglement , the losses along the line , and the nonunit quantum efficiency at the sender location .
