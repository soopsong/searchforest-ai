the quasiprobability representation of quantum states addresses two main concerns , the identification of nonclassical features and the decomposition of the density operator . while the former aspect is a main focus of current research , the latter decomposition property has been studied less frequently . in this contribution , we introduce a method for the generalized expansion of quantum states in terms of so - called quasistates . in contrast to the quasiprobability decomposition through nonclassical distributions and pure - state operators , our technique results in classical probabilities and nonpositive semidefinite operators , defining the notion of quasistates , that carry the information about the nonclassical characteristics of the system . therefore , our method presents a complementary approach to prominent quasiprobability representations . we explore the usefulness of our technique with several examples , including applications for quantum state reconstruction and the representation of nonclassical light . in addition , using our framework , we also demonstrate that inseparable quantum correlations can be described in terms of classical joint probabilities and tensor - product quasistates for an unambiguous identification of quantum entanglement .
