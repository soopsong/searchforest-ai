in this paper we demonstrate that lindblad equations characterized by a random rate variable arise after tracing out a complex structured reservoir . our results follows from a generalization of the born - markov approximation , which relies in the possibility of splitting the complex environment in a direct sum of sub - reservoirs , each one being able to induce by itself a markovian system evolution . strong non - markovian effects , which microscopically originate from the entanglement with the different sub - reservoirs , characterize the average system decay dynamics . as an example , we study the anomalous irreversible behavior of a quantum tunneling system described in an effective two level approximation . stretched exponential and power law decay behaviors arise from the interplay between the dissipative and unitary hopping dynamics .
