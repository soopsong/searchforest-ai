an ordering between the quantum states emerging from a single mode gauge - covariant bosonic gaussian channel is proven . specifically , we show that within the set of input density matrices with the same given spectrum , the element passive with respect to the fock basis ( i.e. diagonal with decreasing eigenvalues ) produces an output which majorizes all the other outputs emerging from the same set . when applied to pure input states , our finding includes as a special case the result of a. mari , et al . , nat . comm . 5 , 3826 ( 2014 ) which implies that the output associated to the vacuum majorizes the others .
