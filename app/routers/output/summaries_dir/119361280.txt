it has been suggested that second - order nonlinearities could be used for quantum logic at the single - photon level . specifically , successive two - photon processes in principle could accomplish the phase shift ( conditioned on the presence of two photons in the low frequency modes ) $ |011 \rangle \longrightarrow i|100 \rangle \longrightarrow -|011 \rangle $ . we have analyzed a recent scheme proposed by xia et al . to induce such a conditional phase shift between two single - photon pulses propagating at different speeds through a nonlinear medium with a nonlocal response . we present here an analytical solution for the most general case , i.e. for an arbitrary response function , initial state , and pulse velocity , which supports their numerical observation that a $ \pi$ phase shift with unit fidelity is possible , in principle , in an appropriate limit . we also discuss why this is possible in this system , despite the theoretical objections to the possibility of conditional phase shifts on single photons that were raised some time ago by shapiro and by one of us .
