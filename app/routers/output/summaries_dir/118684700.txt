the divincenzo criteria for implementing a quantum computer have been seminal in focussing both experimental and theoretical research in quantum information processing . these criteria were formulated specifically for the circuit model of quantum computing . however , several new models for quantum computing ( paradigms ) have been proposed that do not seem to fit the criteria well . the question is therefore what are the general criteria for implementing quantum computers . to this end , a formal operational definition of a quantum computer is introduced . it is then shown that according to this definition a device is a quantum computer if it obeys the following four criteria : any quantum computer must ( 1 ) have a quantum memory ; ( 2 ) facilitate a controlled quantum evolution of the quantum memory ; ( 3 ) include a method for cooling the quantum memory ; and ( 4 ) provide a readout mechanism for subsets of the quantum memory . the criteria are met when the device is scalable and operates fault - tolerantly . we discuss various existing quantum computing paradigms , and how they fit within this framework . finally , we lay out a roadmap for selecting an avenue towards building a quantum computer . this is summarized in a decision tree intended to help experimentalists determine the most natural paradigm given a particular physical implementation .
