we propose the implementation of a switch of particle statistics with an embedding quantum simulator . by encoding both bose - einstein and fermi - dirac statistics into an enlarged hilbert space , the statistics of quantum particles may be changed in situ during the time evolution , from bosons to fermions and from fermions to bosons , as many times as desired . we illustrate our proposal with few - qubit examples , although the protocol is straightforwardly extendable to larger numbers of particles . this proposal can be implemented on different quantum platforms such as trapped ions , quantum photonics , and superconducting circuits , among others . the possibility to implement permutation symmetrization and antisymmetrization of quantum particles enhances the toolbox of quantum simulations , for unphysical operations as well as for symmetry transformations .
