a prerequisite for many quantum information processing tasks to truly surpass classical approaches is an efficient procedure to encode classical data in quantum superposition states . in this work , we present a circuit - based flip - flop quantum random access memory to construct a quantum database of classical information in a systematic and flexible way . for registering or updating classical data consisting of $ m$ entries , each represented by $ n$ bits , the method requires $ o(n)$ qubits and $ o(mn)$ steps . with post - selection at an additional cost , our method can also store continuous data as probability amplitudes . as an example , we present a procedure to convert classical training data for a quantum supervised learning algorithm to a quantum state . further improvements can be achieved by reducing the number of state preparation queries with the introduction of quantum forking .
