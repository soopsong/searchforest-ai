general formulas of entanglement concentration are derived by using an information - spectrum approach for the i.i.d . sequences and the general sequences of partially entangled pure states . that is , we derive general relations between the performance of the entanglement concentration and the eigenvalues of the partially traced state . the achievable rates with constant constraints and those with exponential constraints can be calculated from these formulas .
