quantum lyapunov control was developed in order to transform a quantum system from arbitrary initial states to a target state . the idea is to find control fields that steer the lyapunov function to zero as $ t\rightarrow \infty$ , meanwhile the quantum system is driven to the target state . in order to shorten the time required to reach the target state , we propose two designs to optimize lyapunov control in this paper . the first design makes the lyapunov function decrease as fast as possible with a constraint on the total power of control fields , and the second design has the same purpose but with a constraint on each control field . examples of a three - level system demonstrate that the evolution time for lyapunov control can be significantly shortened , especially when high control fidelity is required . besides , this optimal lyapunov - based quantum control is robust against uncertainties in the free hamiltonian and decoherence in the system compared to conventional lyapunov control .
