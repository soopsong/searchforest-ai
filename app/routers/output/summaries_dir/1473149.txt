we propose a simple probabilistic optical gate to expand polarization entangled w states . the gate uses one polarization - dependent beamsplitter and a horizontally polarized single photon as an ancilla . the gate post - selectively expands $ n$-photon w states to $ ( n+1)$-photon w states . a feasibility analysis considering the realistic experimental conditions show that the scheme is within the reach of the current quantum optical technologies .
