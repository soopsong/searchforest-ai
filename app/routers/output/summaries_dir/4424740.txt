since its introduction 25 years ago , the quantum weak value has gradually transitioned from a theoretical curiosity to a practical laboratory tool . while its utility is apparent in the recent explosion of weak value experiments , its interpretation has historically been a subject of confusion . here a pragmatic introduction to the weak value in terms of measurable quantities is presented , along with an explanation for how it can be determined in the laboratory . further , its application to three distinct experimental techniques is reviewed . first , as a large interaction parameter it can amplify small signals above technical background noise . second , as a measurable complex value it enables novel techniques for direct quantum state and geometric phase determination . third , as a conditioned average of generalized observable eigenvalues it provides a measurable window into nonclassical features of quantum mechanics . in this selective review , a single experimental configuration to discuss and clarify each of these applications is used .
