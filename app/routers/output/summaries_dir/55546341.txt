probabilistic metrology attempts to improve parameter estimation by occasionally reporting an excellent estimate and the rest of the time either guessing or doing nothing at all . here we show that probabilistic metrology can never improve quantum limits on estimation of a single parameter , both on average and asymptotically in number of trials , if performance is judged relative to mean - square estimation error . we extend the result by showing that for a finite number of trials , the probability of obtaining better estimates using probabilistic metrology , as measured by mean - square error , decreases exponentially with the number of trials . to be tight , the performance bounds we derive require that likelihood functions be approximately normal , which in turn depends on how rapidly specific distributions converge to a normal distribution with number of trials .
