until now , most memristor - based chaotic circuits proposed in the literature are based on mathematical models which assume ideal characteristics such as piece - wise linear or cubic non - linearities . the idea , illustrated here and originating from the experimental approach for device characterization , is to realize a chaotic system exploiting the non - linearity of only one memristor with a very simple experimental set - up using feedback . in this way a simple circuit is obtained and chaos is experimentally observed and is confirmed by the calculation of the largest lyapunov exponent . numerical results using the strukov model support the existence of robust chaos in our circuit . this is the first experimental demonstration of chaos in a real memristor circuit and suggests that memristors are well placed for hardware encryption .
