the implementation of non - classical light sources is becoming increasingly important for various quantum applications . a particularly interesting approach is to integrate such functionalities on a single chip as this could pave the way towards fully scalable quantum photonic devices . several approaches using dielectric systems have been investigated in the past . however , it is still not understood how on - chip nanoplasmonic antennas , interacting with a single quantum emitter , affect the quantum statistics of photons reflected or transmitted in the guided mode of a waveguide . here we investigate a quantum photonic platform consisting of an evanescently coupled nanoplasmonic cavity - emitter system and discuss the requirements for non - classical light generation . we develop an analytical model that incorporates quenching due to the nanoplasmonic cavity to predict the quantum statistics of the transmitted and reflected guided waveguide light under weak coherent pumping . the analytical predictions match numerical simulations based on a master equation approach . it is moreover shown that for resonant excitation the degree of anti - bunching in transmission is maximized for an optimal cavity modal volume $ v_{c}$ and cavity - emitter distance $ s$. in reflection , perfectly anti - bunched light can only be obtained for specific $ ( v_{c},s)$ combinations . finally , our model also applies to dielectric cavities and as such can guide future efforts in the design and development of on - chip non - classical light sources using dielectric and nanoplasmonic cavity - emitter systems .
