here we discuss a particle - based approach to deal with systems of many identical quantum objects ( particles ) which never employs labels to mark them . we show that it avoids both methodological problems and drawbacks in the study of quantum correlations associated to the standard quantum mechanical treatment of identical particles . the core of this approach is represented by the multiparticle probability amplitude whose structure in terms of single - particle amplitudes we here derive by first principles . to characterise entanglement among the identical particles , this new method utilises the same notions , such as partial trace , adopted for nonidentical ones . we highlight the connection between our approach and second quantization . we also define spin - exchanged multipartite states ( spes ) which contain a generalisation of w states to identical particles . we prove that their spatial overlap plays a role on the distributed entanglement within multipartite systems and is responsible for the appearance of nonlocal quantum correlations .
