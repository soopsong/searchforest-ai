we study families of fermionic field states in non - inertial frames which show no entanglement survival in the infinite acceleration limit . we generalise some recent results where some particular examples of such states where found . we analyse the abundance and characteristics of the states showing this behaviour and discuss its relation with the statistics of the field . we also consider the phenomenon beyond the single mode approximation .
