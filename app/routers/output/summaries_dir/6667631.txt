the theory of monotone riemannian metrics on the state space of a quantum system was established by denes petz in 1996 . in a recent paper he argued that the scalar curvature of a statistically relevant - monotone - metric can be interpreted as an average statistical uncertainty . the present paper contributes to this subject . it is reasonable to expect that states which are more mixed are less distinguishable than those which are less mixed . the manifestation of this behavior could be that for such a metric the scalar curvature has a maximum at the maximally mixed state . we show that not every monotone metric fulfils this expectation , some of them behave in a very different way . a mathematical condition is given for monotone riemannian metrics to have a local minimum at the maximally mixed state and examples are given for such metrics .
