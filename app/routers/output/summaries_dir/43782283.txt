quantum metrology utilizes nonclassical states to improve the precision of measurement devices . in this context , strongly squeezed vacuum states of light have proven to be a useful resource . they are typically produced by spontaneous parametric down - conversion , but have not been generated at shorter wavelengths so far , as suitable nonlinear materials do not exist . here , we report on the generation of strongly squeezed vacuum states at 532 nm with 5.5 db noise suppression by means of frequency up - conversion from the telecommunication wavelength of 1550 nm . the up - converted states are employed in a model mach - zehnder interferometer to illustrate their use in quantum metrology .
