the barenco gate~($\mathbb{b}$ ) is a type of two - qubit quantum gate based on which alone universal quantum computation can be achieved . each $ \mathbb{b}$ is characterized by three angles ( $ \alpha,\theta$ , and $ \phi$ ) though it works in a two - qubit hilbert space . here we design $ \mathbb{b}$ via a non - collinear interaction $ v|r_1r_2\rangle\langle r_1r_3|+$h.c . , where $ |r_i\rangle$ is a state that can be excited from a qubit state and $ v$ is adjustable . we present two protocols of $ \mathbb{b}$. the first~(second ) protocol consists of two~(six ) pulses and one~(two ) wait period(s ) , where the former causes rotations between the qubit states and excited states , and the latter induces gate transformation via the non - collinear interaction . in the first protocol , the variable $ \phi$ can be tuned by varying phases of external controls , and the other two variables $ \alpha$ and $ \theta$ , tunable via adjusting the wait duration , have a linear dependence upon each other . meanwhile , the first protocol can give rise to the cnot and controlled - y gates . in the second protocol , $ \alpha,\theta$ , and $ \phi$ can be varied by changing the interaction amplitudes and wait durations , and the latter two are dependent on $ \alpha$ non - linearly . both protocols can also lead to another universal gate when $ \{\alpha,\phi\}=\{1/4,1/2\}\pi$ with appropriate parameters . implementation of these universal gates is analyzed based on the van der waals interaction of neutral rydberg atoms .
