a resonant two level atom doped in one dimensional waveguide behaves as a mirror , but this single - atom"mirror"can only reflect single photon perfectly at a specific frequency . for a one dimensional coupled - resonator waveguide , we propose to extend the perfect reflection region from a specific frequency to a wide band by placing many atoms individually in the resonators in a finite coordinate region of the waveguide . such a doped resonator array promises us to control the propagation of a practical photon wave packet with certain momentum distribution instead of a single photon , which is ideally represented by a plane wave with specific momentum . the studies based on the discrete - coordinate scattering theory display that such hybrid structure indeed provides a near - perfect reflection for single photon in a wide band . we also calculated photon group velocity distribution , which shows that the perfect reflection with wide band exactly corresponds to the stopping light region .
