most investigations of multipartite entanglement have been concerned with temporal modes of the electromagnetic field , and have neglected its spatial structure . we present a simple model which allows to generate tripartite entanglement between spatial modes by parametric down - conversion with two symmetrically - tilted plane waves serving as a pump . the characteristics of this entanglement are investigated . we also discuss the generalization of our scheme to 2n+1-partite entanglement using 2n symmetrically - tilted plane pump waves . another interesting feature is the possibility of entanglement localization in just two spatial modes .
