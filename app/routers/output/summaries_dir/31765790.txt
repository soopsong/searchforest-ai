silicon waveguides are promising $ \chi^3$-based photon pair sources . demonstrations so far have been based on picosecond pulsed lasers . here , we present the first investigation of photon pair generation in silicon waveguides in a continuous regime . the source is characterized by coincidence measurements . we uncover the presence of unexpected noise which had not been noticed in earlier experiments . subsequently , we present advances towards integration of the photon pair source with other components on the chip . this is demonstrated by photon pair generation in a sagnac loop interferometer and inside a micro - ring cavity . comparison with the straight waveguide shows that these are promising avenues for improving the source . in particular photon pair generation in the micro - ring cavity yields a source with a spectral width of approximately 150 pm resulting in a spectral brightness increased by more than 2 orders of magnitude .
