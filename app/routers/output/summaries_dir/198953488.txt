a study of the artificial neural network representation of quantum many - body states is presented . the locality and entanglement properties of states for shallow and deep quantum neural networks are investigated in detail . by introducing the notion of local quasi - product states , for which the locally connected shallow feed - forward neural network states and restricted boltzmann machine states are special cases , we show that r\'{e}nyi entanglement entropies of all these states obey the entanglement area law . besides , we also investigate the entanglement features of deep boltzmann machine states and show that locality constraints imposed on the neural networks make the states obey the entanglement area law . finally , as an application , we apply the notion of r\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy to understanding the power of neural networks and show that image classification problems which can be efficiently solved must obey the area law .
