the highest current estimates for the amount of noise a quantum computer can tolerate are based on fault - tolerance schemes relying heavily on postselecting on no detected errors . however , there has been no proof that these schemes give even a positive tolerable noise threshold . a technique to prove a positive threshold , for probabilistic noise models , is presented . the main idea is to maintain strong control over the distribution of errors in the quantum state at all times . this distribution has correlations which conceivably could grow out of control with postselection . but in fact , the error distribution can be written as a mixture of nearby distributions each satisfying strong independence properties , so there are no correlations for postselection to amplify .
