non - hermitian hamiltonians with the equidistant spectrum of the harmonic oscillator are studied in terms of a bi - orthogonal system that behaves as a complete set of orthonormal vectors . the approach permits to work with these non - hermitian hamiltonians as if they were hermitian operators . some of the criteria that are useful to identify nonclassicality in hermitian systems are adapted to test the pure states of the non - hermitian oscillators . several nonclassical states are uniquely constructed as bi - orthogonal superpositions of the corresponding eigenstates .
