we present and discuss different protocols for preparing an arbitrary quantum state of a qubit using only a restricted set of measurements , with no unitary operations at all . we show that an arbitrary state can indeed be prepared , provided that the available measurements satisfy certain requirements . our results shed light on the role that measurement - induced back - action plays in quantum feedback control and the extent to which this back - action can be exploited in quantum - control protocols .
