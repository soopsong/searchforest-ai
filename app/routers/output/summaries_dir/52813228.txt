finding strategies to preserve quantum resources in open systems is nowadays a main requirement for reliable quantum - enhanced technologies . we address this issue by considering structured cavities embedding qubits driven by a control technique known as frequency modulation . we first study a single qubit in a lossy cavity to determine optimal modulation parameters and qubit - cavity coupling regime allowing a gain of four orders of magnitude concerning coherence lifetimes . we relate this behavior to the inhibition of the qubit effective decay rate rather than to stronger memory effects ( non - markovianity ) of the system . we then exploit these findings in a system of noninteracting qubits embedded in separated cavities to gain basic information about scalability of the procedure . we show that the determined modulation parameters enable lifetimes of quantum resources , such as entanglement , discord and coherence , three orders of magnitude longer than their natural ( uncontrolled ) decay times . we discuss the feasibility of the system within the circuit - qed scenario , typically employed in the current quantum computer prototypes . these results provide new insights towards efficient experimental strategies against decoherence .
