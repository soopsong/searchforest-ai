an experimental proposal is presented in which dark port post - selection together with weak measurements are used to enlarge the radiation pressure effect of a single photon on a mechanical oscillator placed in the middle of a fabry - perot cavity and initialized in the ground state . by preparing and post - selecting the photon ( the system ) in two quasi orthogonal states , the weak value of the radiation force operator can lie outside the eigenvalue spectrum , producing a large shift on the wave function of the mechanical oscillator ( the measuring device ) in the position representation . consequently , the effect of a single photon on the average position of the oscillator in its final state can be amplified as compared to the effect caused by a photon without post - selection , i.e. only pre - selected . the strong measurement scenario is also analyzed . in this case , a higher amplification effect is achieved and the mean position of the oscillator reaches the level of the zero - point fluctuation , but the back - action on the system is increased and the post - selection probabilities are smaller .
