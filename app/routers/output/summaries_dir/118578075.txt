in this paper we investigate how the dynamics of a two - level atom is affected by its interaction with the quantized near field of a plasmonic slab in relative motion . we demonstrate that for small separation distances and a relative velocity greater than a certain threshold , this interaction can lead to a population inversion , such that the probability of the excited state exceeds the probability of the ground state , corresponding to a negative spontaneous emission rate . it is shown that the developed theory is intimately related to a classical problem . the problem of quantum friction is analyzed and the differences with respect to the corresponding classical effect are highlighted .
