non - trivial reversible identities ( ntris ) are reversible circuits that have equal inputs and outputs . ntris can not be detected using optimization algorithms in the literature . existence of ntris in a circuit will cause a slow down by increasing the number of gates and the quantum cost . ntris might arise due to integration between two or more optimal reversible circuits . in this paper , an algorithm that detects and removes ntris in polynomial time will be proposed . experiments that show the bad effect of ntris and the enhancement using the proposed algorithm will be presented .
