investigating solids with light gives direct access to charge dynamics , electronic and magnetic excitations . for heavy fermions , one has to adjust the frequency of the probing light to the small characteristic energy scales , leading to spectroscopy with microwaves . we review general concepts of the frequency - dependent conductivity of heavy fermions , including the slow drude relaxation and the transition to a superconducting state , which we also demonstrate with experimental data taken on upd2al3 . we discuss the optical response of a fermi liquid and how it might be observed in heavy fermions . microwave studies with focus on quantum criticality in heavy fermions concern the charge response , but also the magnetic moments can be addressed via electron spin resonance ( esr ) . we discuss the case of ybrh2si2 , the open questions concerning esr of heavy fermions , and how these might be addressed in the future . this includes an overview of the presently available experimental techniques for microwave studies on heavy fermions , with a focus on broadband studies using the corbino approach and on planar superconducting resonators .
