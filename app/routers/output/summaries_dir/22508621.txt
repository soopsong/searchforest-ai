deterministically aperiodic sequences are an intermediary between periodic sequences and completely random sequences . materials which are translationally periodic have bloch - like extended states , while random media exhibit anderson localisation . materials constructed on the basis of deterministic aperiodic sequences such as fibonacci , thue - morse , and rudin - shapiro exhibit different properties , which can be related to their spectrum . here , by investigating the dynamics of discrete - time quantum walks using different aperiodic sequences of coin operations in position space and time we establish the role of the diffraction spectra in characterizing the spreading of the wavepacket .
