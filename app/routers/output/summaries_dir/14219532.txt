we obtain a collection of necessary ( sufficient ) conditions for a bipartite system of qubits to be separable ( entangled ) , which are based on the landau - pollak formulation of the uncertainty principle . these conditions are tested , and compared with previously stated criteria , by applying them to states whose separability limits are already known . our results are also extended to multipartite and higher - dimensional systems .
