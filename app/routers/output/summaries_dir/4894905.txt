we present a novel , universal description of quantum entanglement using group theory and generalized characteristic functions . it leads to new reformulations of the separability problem , and the positivity of partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion . the latter turns out to be intimately related to a certain reality condition for group representations . within our formalism , we also show a connection between existence of entanglement and group non - commutativity .
