quantum filtering is a signal processing technique that estimates the posterior state of a quantum system under continuous measurements and has become a standard tool in quantum information processing , with applications in quantum state preparation , quantum metrology , and quantum control . if the filter assumes a nominal model that differs from reality , however , the estimation accuracy is bound to suffer . here i derive identities that relate the excess error caused by quantum filter mismatch to the relative entropy between the true and nominal observation probability measures , with one identity for gaussian measurements , such as optical homodyne detection , and another for poissonian measurements , such as photon counting . these identities generalize recent seminal results in classical information theory and provide new operational meanings to relative entropy , mutual information , and channel capacity in the context of quantum experiments .
