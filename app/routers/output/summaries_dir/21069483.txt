by coupling controllable quantum systems into larger structures we introduce the concept of a quantum metamaterial . conventional meta - materials represent one of the most important frontiers in optical design , with applications in diverse fields ranging from medicine to aerospace . up until now however , metamaterials have themselves been classical structures and interact only with the classical properties of light . here we describe a class of dynamic metamaterials , based on the quantum properties of coupled atom - cavity arrays , which are intrinsically lossless , reconfigurable , and operate fundamentally at the quantum level . we show how this new class of metamaterial could be used to create a reconfigurable quantum superlens possessing a negative index gradient for single photon imaging . with the inherent features of quantum superposition and entanglement of metamaterial properties , this new class of dynamic quantum metamaterial , opens a new vista for quantum science and technology .
