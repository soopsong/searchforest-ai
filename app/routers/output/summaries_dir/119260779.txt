a semiclassical simulation approach is presented for studying quantum noise in large - scale photonic circuits incorporating an ideal kerr nonlinearity . a circuit solver is used to generate matrices defining a set of stochastic differential equations , in which the resonator field variables represent random samplings of the wigner quasi - probability distributions . although the semiclassical approach involves making a large - photon - number approximation , tests on one- and two - resonator circuits indicate satisfactory agreement between the semiclassical and full - quantum simulation results in the parameter regime of interest . the semiclassical model is used to simulate random errors in a large - scale circuit that contains 88 resonators and hundreds of components in total , and functions as a 4-bit ripple counter . the error rate as a function of on - state photon number is examined , and it is observed that the quantum fluctuation amplitudes do not increase as signals propagate through the circuit , an important property for scalability .
