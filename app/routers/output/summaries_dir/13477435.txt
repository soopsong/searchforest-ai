if a black hole ( bh ) is initially in an approximately pure state and it evaporates by a unitary process , then the emitted radiation will be in a highly quantum state . as the purifier of this radiation , the state of the bh interior must also be in some highly quantum state . so that , within the interior region , the mean - field approximation can not be valid and the state of the bh can not be described by some semiclassical metric . on this basis , we model the state of the bh interior as a collection of a large number of excitations that are packed into closely spaced but single - occupancy energy levels ; a sort - of"fermi sea"of all light - enough particles . this highly quantum state is surrounded by a semiclassical region that lies close to the horizon and has a non - vanishing energy density . it is shown that such a state looks like a bh from the outside and decays via gravitational pair production in the near - horizon region at a rate that agrees with the hawking rate . we also consider the fate of a classical object that has passed through to the bh interior and show that , once it has crossed over the near - horizon threshold , the object meets its demise extremely fast . this result can not be attributed to a"firewall " , as the trauma to the in - falling object only begins after it has passed through the near - horizon region and enters a region where semiclassical spacetime ends but the energy density is still parametrically smaller than planckian .
