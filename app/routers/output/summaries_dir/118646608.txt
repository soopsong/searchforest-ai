we propose a scheme for quantum teleportation between two qubits , coupled sequentially to a cavity field . an implementation of the scheme is analyzed with superconducting qubits and a transmission line resonator , where measurements are restricted to continuous probing of the field leaking from the resonator rather than instantaneous projective bell state measurement . we show that the past quantum state formalism [ s. gammelmark et al , phys . rev . 111 , 160401 ] can be successfully applied to estimate what would have been the most likely bell measurement outcome conditioned on our continuous signal record . this information determines which local operation on the target qubit yields the optimal teleportation fidelity . our results emphasize the significance of applying a detailed analysis of quantum measurements in feed - forward protocols in non - ideal leaky quantum systems .
