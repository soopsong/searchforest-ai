we describe a protocol for continuously protecting unknown quantum states from decoherence that incorporates design principles from both quantum error correction and quantum feedback control . our protocol uses continuous measurements and hamiltonian operations , which are weaker control tools than are typically assumed for quantum error correction . we develop a cost function appropriate for unknown quantum states and use it to optimize our state - estimate feedback . using monte carlo simulations , we study our protocol for the three - qubit bit - flip code in detail and demonstrate that it can improve the fidelity of quantum states beyond what is achievable using quantum error correction when the time between quantum error correction cycles is limited .
