we estimate the teleported and the gained parameters by means of fisher information in a non - inertial frame . the sender and the receiver share an accelerated maximum or partial entangled state . the estimation degree of these parameters depends on unruh acceleration , the used single mode approximation(within/ beyond ) , the structure of the initial teleported state , and the entanglement of the initial communication channel . the maximization and minimization estimation degree of the teleported parameters depend on the initial encoded information . the estimation degree of the parameters can be maximized if the partners teleport classical information .
