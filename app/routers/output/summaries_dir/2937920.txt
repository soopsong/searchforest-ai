we develop a complete analytical description of the time evolution of squeezed states of a charged particle under the fock - darwin hamiltonian and a time - dependent electric field . this result generalises a relation obtained by infeld and pleba\'nski for states of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator . we relate the evolution of a state - vector subjected to squeezing to that of state which is not subjected to squeezing and for which the time - evolution under the simple harmonic oscillator dynamics is known ( e.g. an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ) . a corresponding relation is also established for the wigner functions of the states , in view of their utility in the analysis of cold - ion experiments . in an appendix , we compute the response functions of the fd hamiltonian to an external electric field , using the same techniques as in the main text .
