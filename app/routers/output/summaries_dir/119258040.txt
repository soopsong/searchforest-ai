we model energy transfer between two coupled four - level chromophores with arbitrarily spaced energy levels . our analysis takes into account the crucial --- yet often ignored --- process of initial excitation by light that is incident on the chromophores . we show that the amount of entanglement generated between the chromophores is strongly dependent on the degree of initial excitation as well as the inclusion of higher energy levels . we apply our model to the specific example of chlorophyll . our results suggest that an excitation - dependent approach should be employed for entanglement studies on multi - level light - harvesting systems even when a two - level approximation is valid .
