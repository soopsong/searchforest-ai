nonclassicality criteria based on intensity moments and derived from the usual matrix approach are compared to those provided by the majorization theory . the majorization theory is shown to give a greater number of more suitable nonclassicality criteria . fifteen experimentally useful criteria of the majorization theory containing the intensity moments up to the fifth order are identified . their performance is experimentally demonstrated on the set of eleven potentially nonclassical states generated from a twin beam by postselection based on detecting a given number of photocounts in one arm by using an iccd camera .
