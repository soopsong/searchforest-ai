we extend the notion of quantum information flow defined by danos and kashefi for the one - way model and present a necessary and sufficient condition for the deterministic computation in this model . the generalized flow also applied in the extended model with measurements in the x - y , x - z and y - z planes . we apply both measurement calculus and the stabiliser formalism to derive our main theorem which for the first time gives a full characterization of the deterministic computation in the one - way model . we present several examples to show how our result improves over the traditional notion of flow , such as geometries ( entanglement graph with input and output ) with no flow but having generalized flow and we discuss how they lead to an optimal implementation of the unitaries . more importantly one can also obtain a better quantum computation depth with the generalized flow rather than with flow . we believe our characterization result is particularly essential for the study of the algorithms and complexity in the one - way model .
