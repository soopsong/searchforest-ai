the partial transpose of a block matrix m is the matrix obtained by transposing the blocks of m independently . we approach the notion of partial transpose from a combinatorial point of view . in this perspective , we solve some basic enumeration problems concerning the partial transpose of permutation matrices . more specifically , we count the number of permutations matrices which are equal to their partial transpose and the number of permutation matrices whose partial transpose is still a permutation . we solve these problems also when restricted to symmetric permutation matrices only .
