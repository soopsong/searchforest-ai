we revisit the fidelity as a measure for the stability and the complexity of the quantum motion of single and many - body systems . within the context of cold atoms , we present on overview of applications of two fidelities which we call static and dynamical fidelity , respectively . the static fidelity applies to quantum problems which can be diagonalized since it is defined via the eigenfunctions . in particular , we show that the static fidelity is a highly effective practical detector of avoided crossings characterizing the complexity of the systems and their evolutions . the dynamical fidelity is defined via the time - dependent wave functions . focussing on the quantum kicked rotor system , we highlight a few practical applications of fidelity measurements in order to better understand the large variety of dynamical regimes of this paradigm of a low - dimensional system with mixed regular - chaotic phase space .
