we propose a quantum feedback scheme for the preparation and protection of photon number states of light trapped in a high - q microwave cavity . a quantum non - demolition measurement of the cavity field provides information on the photon number distribution . the feedback loop is closed by injecting into the cavity a coherent pulse adjusted to increase the probability of the target photon number . the efficiency and reliability of the closed - loop state stabilization is assessed by quantum monte - carlo simulations . we show that , in realistic experimental conditions , fock states are efficiently produced and protected against decoherence .
