we propose a scheme for the complete differentiation of 64 three - photon hyperentangled ghz states in both polarization and spatial - mode degrees of freedoms using the quantum - dot cavity system . the three - photon hyperentangled - ghz - state - analysis scheme can also be used to generate 3-photon hyperentangled ghz states . this proposed hyperentangled analysis and generation device can serve as crucial components of the high - capacity , long - distance quantum communication . we use quantum swapping as an example to show the application of this device in quantum communication with polarization and spatial - mode degrees of freedoms . using numerical calculations , we show that the present scheme may be feasible in strong - coupling regimes with current technologies .
