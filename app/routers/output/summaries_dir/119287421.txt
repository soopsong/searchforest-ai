we show exactly that the squared entanglement of formation ( sef ) obeys a set of hierarchical monogamy relations for an arbitrary $ n$-qubit mixed state . based on this set of monogamy relations , we are able to construct the set of hierarchical multipartite entanglement indicators for $ n$-qubit states , which still work well even when the concurrence - based indicators lose efficacy . as a by - product , an intriguing analytical relation between the entanglement of formation ( eof ) and squared concurrence ( sc ) for an arbitrary mixed state of $ 2\otimes d$ systems is derived , making the concurrence calculable via the corresponding eof . furthermore , we analyze the multipartite entanglement dynamics in composite cavity - reservoir systems with the present set of hierarchical indicators . moreover , for multilevel systems , it is illustrated that the sef can be monogamous even if the sc is polygamous .
