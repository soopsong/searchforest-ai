this paper presents a new symmetrical theory ( st ) of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics which postulates : quantum mechanics is a theory about complete experiments , not particles ; a complete experiment is maximally described by a complex transition amplitude density ; and this transition amplitude density never collapses . this new st is compared to the conventional theory ( ct ) of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics for the analysis of a beam - splitter experiment . the st makes several experimentally testable predictions that differ from the ct , which can be checked using existing technology . the st also solves one part of the ct measurement problem , and resolves some of the paradoxes of the ct . this nonrelativistic st is the low energy limit of a relativistic st presented in an earlier paper \cite{heaney1 } .
