making a system state follow a prescribed trajectory despite fluctuations and errors commonly consists in monitoring an observable ( temperature , blood - glucose level ... ) and reacting on its controllers ( heater power , insulin amount ... ) . in the quantum domain , there is a change of paradigm in feedback since measurements modify the state of the system , most dramatically when the trajectory goes through superpositions of measurement eigenstates . here , we demonstrate the stabilization of an arbitrary trajectory of a superconducting qubit by measurement based feedback . the protocol benefits from the long coherence time ( $ t_2>10 \mu$s ) of the 3d transmon qubit , the high efficiency ( 82 % ) of the phase preserving josephson amplifier , and fast electronics ensuring less than 500 ns delay . at discrete time intervals , the state of the qubit is measured and corrected in case an error is detected . for rabi oscillations , where the discrete measurements occur when the qubit is supposed to be in the measurement pointer states , we demonstrate an average fidelity of 85 % to the targeted trajectory . for ramsey oscillations , which does not go through pointer states , the average fidelity reaches 75 % . incidentally , we demonstrate a fast reset protocol allowing to cool a 3d transmon qubit down to 0.6 % in the excited state .
