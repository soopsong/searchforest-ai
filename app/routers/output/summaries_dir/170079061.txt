a device called a ` gaussian boson sampler ' has initially been proposed as a near - term demonstration of classically intractable quantum computation . as recently shown , it can also be used to decide whether two graphs are isomorphic . based on these results we construct a feature map and graph similarity measure or ` graph kernel ' using samples from the device . we show that the kernel performs well compared to standard graph kernels on typical benchmark datasets , and provide a theoretical motivation for this success , linking the distribution of a gaussian boson sampler to the number of matchings in subgraphs . our results contribute to a new way of thinking about kernels as a ( quantum ) hardware - efficient feature mapping , and lead to an interesting application for near - term quantum computing .
