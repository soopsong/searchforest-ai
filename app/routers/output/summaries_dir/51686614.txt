we present a scheme for dissipatively generating maximal entanglement in a heralded manner . our setup requires incoherent interactions with two thermal baths at different temperatures , but no source of work or control . a pair of $ ( d+1)$-dimensional quantum systems is first driven to an entangled steady state by the temperature gradient , and maximal entanglement in dimension $ d$ can then be heralded via local filters . we discuss experimental prospects considering an implementation in superconducting systems .
