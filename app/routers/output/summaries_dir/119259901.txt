in an approach to quantum gravity where space - time arises from coarse graining of fundamentally discrete structures , black hole formation and subsequent evaporation can be described by a unitary evolution without the problems encountered by the standard remnant scenario or the schemes where information is assumed to come out with the radiation while evaporation ( firewalls and complementarity ) . the final state is purified by correlations with the fundamental pre - geometric structures ( in the sense of wheeler ) which are available in such approaches , and , like defects in the underlying space - time weave , can carry zero energy .
