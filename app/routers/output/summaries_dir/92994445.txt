we provide an efficient and general route for preparing non - trivial quantum states that are not adiabatically connected to unentangled product states . our approach is a hybrid quantum - classical variational protocol that incorporates a feedback loop between a quantum simulator and a classical computer , and is experimentally realizable on near - term quantum devices of synthetic quantum systems . we find explicit protocols which prepare with perfect fidelities ( i ) the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state , ( ii ) a quantum critical state , and ( iii ) a topologically ordered state , with $ l$ variational parameters and physical runtimes $ t$ that scale linearly with the system size $ l$. we furthermore conjecture and support numerically that our protocol can prepare , with perfect fidelity and similar operational costs , the ground state of every point in the one dimensional transverse field ising model phase diagram . besides being practically useful , our results also illustrate the utility of such variational ans\"atze as good descriptions of non - trivial states of matter .
