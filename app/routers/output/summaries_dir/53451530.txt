in ads / cft , how is the bulk first law realized in the boundary cft ? recently , faulkner et al . showed that in certain holographic contexts , the bulk first law has a precise microscopic interpretation as a first law of entanglement entropy in the boundary theory . however , the bulk can also satisfy a first law when the boundary density matrix is pure , i.e. in the absence of entanglement with other degrees of freedom . in this note we argue that the bulk first law should generally be understood in terms of a particular coarse - graining of the boundary theory . we use geons , or single - exterior black holes , as a testing ground for this idea . our main result is that for a class of small perturbations to these spacetimes the wald entropy agrees to first order with the one - point entropy , a coarse - grained entropy recently proposed by kelly and wall . this result also extends the regime over which the one - point entropy is known to be equal to the causal holographic information of hubeny and rangamani .
