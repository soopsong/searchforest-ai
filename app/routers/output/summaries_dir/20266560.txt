we present a comparative analysis of exact and approximate quantum error correction by means of simple unabridged analytical computations . for the sake of clarity , using primitive quantum codes , we study the exact and approximate error correction of the two simplest unital ( pauli errors ) and nonunital ( non - pauli errors ) noise models , respectively . the similarities and differences between the two scenarios are stressed . in addition , the performances of quantum codes quantified by means of the entanglement fidelity for different recovery schemes are taken into consideration in the approximate case . finally , the role of self - complementarity in approximate quantum error correction is briefly addressed .
