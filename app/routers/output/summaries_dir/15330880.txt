we provide a method for estimating spectral gaps in low - dimensional systems . unlike traditional phase estimation , our approach does not require ancillary qubits nor does it require well characterised gates . instead , it only requires the ability to perform approximate haar - random unitary operations , applying the unitary whose eigenspectrum is sought out and performing measurements in the computational basis . we discuss application of these ideas to in - place amplitude estimation and quantum device calibration .
