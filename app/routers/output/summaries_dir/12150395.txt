we study the connection between magnetization transport and magnetization profiles in zero - temperature xx chains . the time evolution of the transverse magnetization m(x , t ) is calculated using an inhomogeneous initial state that is the ground state at fixed magnetization but with m reversed from -m(0 ) for x<0 to m(0 ) for x>0 . in the long - time limit , the magnetization evolves into a scaling form m(x , t)=phi(x / t ) and the profile develops a flat part ( m = phi=0 ) in the ( x / t)<or = c(m(0 ) ) region . the flat region shrinks to zero if m(0)-->1/2 while it expands with the maximum velocity c(0)=1 for m(0)-->0 . the states emerging in the scaling limit are compared to those of a homogeneous system where the same magnetization current is driven by a bulk field , and we find that the expectation values of various quantities ( energy , occupation number in the fermionic representation ) agree in the two systems .
