current processes validation methods rely on di- verse input states and exponential applications of state tomog- raphy . through generalization of classical test theory exceptions to this rule are found . instead of expanding a complete operator basis to validate a process , the objective is to utilize quan tum effects making each gate realized in the process act on a complete set of characteristic states and next extract functional in forma- tion . random noise , systematic errors , initialization inaccuracies and measurement faults must also be detected . this concept is applied to the switching class comprising the search oracle . in a first approach , the test set cardinality is held constant to six ; both testability and added depth complexity of an additional " design - for - test " circuit are related to the function real ized in the oracle . oracles realizing affine functions are shown to gene rate no net entanglement and are thus the easiest to test , where oracles realizing bent functions are the most difficult to te st . a second approach replaces extraction complexity with a linear growth in experiment count . an interesting corollary of this study is the success found when addressing the classical test problem quantum mechanically . the validation of all classical degrees of freedom in a quantum switching network were found to necessitate exponentially fewer averaged observables than the number of tests in the classical lower bound .
