we study sequences ( both cyclic and randomized ) of idempotent completely - positive trace - preserving quantum maps , and show how they asymptotically converge to the intersection of their fixed point sets via alternating projection methods . we characterize the robustness features of the protocol against randomization and provide basic bounds on its convergence speed . the general results are then specialized to stabilizing en- tangled states in finite - dimensional multipartite quantum systems subject to a resource constraint , a problem of key interest for quantum information applications . we conclude by suggesting further developments , including techniques to enlarge the set of stabilizable states and ensure efficient , finite - time preparation .
