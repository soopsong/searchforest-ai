we demonstrate pulsed polarization - entangled photons generated from a periodically poled $ \mathrm{ktiopo_4}$ ( ppktp ) crystal in a sagnac interferometer configuration at telecom wavelength . since the group - velocity - matching ( gvm ) condition is satisfied , the intrinsic spectral purity of the photons is much higher than in the previous scheme at around 800 nm wavelength . the combination of a sagnac interferometer and the gvm - ppktp crystal makes our entangled source compact , stable , highly entangled , spectrally pure and ultra - bright . the photons were detected by two superconducting nanowire single photon detectors ( snspds ) with detection efficiencies of 70 % and 68 % at dark counts of less than 1 kcps . we achieved fidelities of 0.981 $ \pm$ 0.0002 for $ \left| { \psi ^ - } \right\rangle$ and 0.980 $ \pm$ 0.001 for $ \left| { \psi ^ + } \right\rangle$ respectively . this gvm - ppktp - sagnac scheme is directly applicable to quantum communication experiments at telecom wavelength , especially in free space .
