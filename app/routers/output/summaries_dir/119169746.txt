we derive a generalized wave - particle duality relation for arbitrary multipath quantum interference phenomena . beyond the conventional notion of the wave nature of a quantum system , i.e. , the interference fringe visibility , we introduce a quantifier as the normalized quantum coherence , recently defined in the framework of quantum information theory . to witness the particle nature , we quantify the path distinguishability or the which - path information based on unambiguous quantum state discrimination . then , the bohr complementarity principle for multipath quantum interference can be stated as a duality relation between the quantum coherence and the path distinguishability . for two - path interference , the quantum coherence is identical to the interference fringe visibility , and the relation reduces to the well - known complementarity relation . the duality relation continues to hold in the case where mixedness is introduced due to possible decoherence effects .
