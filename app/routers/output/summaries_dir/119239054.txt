it is crucial for various quantum information processing tasks that the state of a quantum system can be determined reliably and efficiently from general quantum measurements . one important class of measurements for this purpose is symmetric informationally complete positive operator - valued measurements ( sic - povms ) . sic - povms have the advantage of providing an unbiased estimator for the quantum state with the minimal number of outcomes needed for full tomography . by virtue of naimark 's dilation theorem , any povm can always be realized with a suitable coupling between the system and an auxiliary system and by performing a projective measurement on the joint system . in practice , finding the appropriate coupling is rather non - trivial . here we propose an experimental design for directly implementing sic - povms using multiport devices and path - encoded qubits and qutrits , the utility of which has recently been demonstrated by several experimental groups around the world . furthermore , we describe how these multiports can be attained in practice with an integrated photonic system composed of nested linear optical elements .
