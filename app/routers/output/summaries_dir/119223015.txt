studies of emerging photovoltaics , such as organic and perovskite solar cells , have recently shown that the separation of photo - generated charge carriers is correlated with non - thermal , coherent oscillations within the illuminated device . we consider this experimental evidence in light of results from the theory of open quantum systems that point to the need for a self - oscillating internal capacitor , acting as a microscopic piston , to explain how an illuminated solar cell operates as an autonomous heat engine . we propose a picture of work extraction by photovoltaic devices that supersedes the quasi - static descriptions prevalent in the literature . finally , we argue that such a dialogue between condensed matter physics and quantum thermodynamics may offer a guide for the design of new energy transducers .
