text of abstract ( we present a utilitarian review of the family of matrix groups $ sp(2n,\re)$ , in a form suited to various applications both in optics and quantum mechanics . we contrast these groups and their geometry with the much more familiar euclidean and unitary geometries . both the properties of finite group elements and of the lie algebra are studied , and special attention is paid to the so - called unitary metaplectic representation of $ sp(2n,\re)$. global decomposition theorems , interesting subgroups and their generators are described . turning to $ n$-mode quantum systems , we define and study their variance matrices in general states , the implications of the heisenberg uncertainty principles , and develop a u(n)-invariant squeezing criterion . the particular properties of wigner distributions and gaussian pure state wavefunctions under $ sp(2n,\re)$ action are delineated . )
