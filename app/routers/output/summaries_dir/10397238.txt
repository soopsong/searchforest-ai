in secure quantum communication protocols , a set of single qubits prepared using 2 or more mutually unbiased bases or a set of $ n$-qubit ( $ n\geq2 $ ) entangled states of a particular form are usually used to form a verification string which is subsequently used to detect traces of eavesdropping . the qubits that form a verification string are referred to as decoy qubits , and there exists a large set of different quantum states that can be used as decoy qubits . in the absence of noise , any choice of decoy qubits provides equivalent security . in this paper , we examine such equivalence for noisy environment ( e.g. , in amplitude damping , phase damping , collective dephasing and collective rotation noise channels ) by comparing the decoy - qubit assisted schemes of secure quantum communication that use single qubit states as decoy qubits with the schemes that use entangled states as decoy qubits . our study reveals that the single qubit assisted scheme perform better in some noisy environments , while some entangled qubits assisted schemes perform better in other noisy environments . specifically , single qubits assisted schemes perform better in amplitude damping and phase damping noisy channels , whereas a few bell - state - based decoy schemes are found to perform better in the presence of the collective noise . thus , if the kind of noise present in a communication channel ( i.e. , the characteristics of the channel ) is known or measured , then the present study can provide the best choice of decoy qubits required for implementation of schemes of secure quantum communication through that channel .
