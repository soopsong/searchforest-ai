the quantum state of a superconducting qubit nonresonantly coupled to a transmission line resonator can be determined by measuring the quadrature amplitudes of an electromagnetic field transmitted through the resonator . we present experiments in which we analyze in detail the dynamics of the transmitted field as a function of the measurement frequency for both weak continuous and pulsed measurements . we find excellent agreement between our data and calculations based on a set of bloch - type differential equations for the cavity field derived from the dispersive jaynes - cummings hamiltonian including dissipation . we show that the measured system response can be used to construct a measurement operator from which the qubit population can be inferred accurately . such a measurement operator can be used in tomographic methods to reconstruct single and multiqubit states in ensemble - averaged measurements .
