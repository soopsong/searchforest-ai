the claims made in a manifesto resulting in the european quantum technologies flagship initiative in quantum technology and similar enterprises are taken as starting point to critically review some potential quantum resources , such as coherent superposition and entanglement , and their potential usefulness for parallelism and communication . claims of absolute , irreducible ( non - epistemic ) randomness are argued to be metaphysical . cryptanalytic man - in - the - middle attacks on quantum cryptography are well known to be feasible , but hardly mentioned . if all of this is taken into account , a more sober perspective on quantum capacities emerges , but one that may be ethically more justified than the"hype and magic"that drives many current initiatives .
