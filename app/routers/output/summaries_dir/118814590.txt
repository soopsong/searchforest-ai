we suggest and demonstrate a tomographic method to fully characterize homodyne detectors at the quantum level . the operator measure associated with the detector is expanded in the quadrature basis and probed with a set of coherent states . the coefficients of the expansion are retrieved using a least squares algorithm . we then validate the reconstructed operator measure on nonclassical states . finally , we exploit results to estimate the overall quantum efficiency of the detector .
