in this paper , we present a simple class of non - local field theories whose ground state entanglement entropy follows a volume law as long as the size of subsystem is smaller than a certain scale . we will confirm this volume law both from numerical calculations and from analytical estimation . this behavior fits nicely with holographic results for spacetimes whose curvatures are much smaller than ads spaces such as those in the flat spacetime .
