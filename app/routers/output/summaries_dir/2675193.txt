as quantum computers of non - trivial size become available in the near future , it is imperative to develop tools to emulate small quantum computers . this allows for validation and debugging of algorithms as well as exploring hardware - software co - design to guide the development of quantum hardware and architectures . the simulation of quantum computers entails multiplications of sparse matrices with very large dense vectors of dimension $ 2^n$ , where $ n$ denotes the number of qubits , making this a memory - bound and network bandwidth - limited application . we introduce the concept of a quantum computer \textit{emulator } as a component of a software framework for quantum computing , enabling a significant performance advantage over simulators by emulating quantum algorithms at a high level rather than simulating individual gate operations . we describe various optimization approaches and present benchmarking results , establishing the superiority of quantum computer emulators in terms of performance .
