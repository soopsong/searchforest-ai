we consider the problem of trying to send a single classical bit through a noisy quantum channel when two transmissions through the channel are available as a resource . classically , two transmissions add nothing to the receiver 's capability of inferring the bit . in the quantum world , however , one has the possible further advantage of entangling the two transmissions . we demonstrate that , for certain noisy channels , such entangled transmissions enhance the receiver 's capability of a correct inference .
