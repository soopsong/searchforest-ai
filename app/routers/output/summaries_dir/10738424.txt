an important class of contextuality arguments in quantum foundations are the all - versus - nothing ( avn ) proofs , generalising a construction originally due to mermin . we present a general formulation of all - versus - nothing arguments , and a complete characterisation of all such arguments which arise from stabiliser states . we show that every avn argument for an n - qubit stabiliser state can be reduced to an avn proof for a three - qubit state which is local clifford - equivalent to the tripartite ghz state . this is achieved through a combinatorial characterisation of avn arguments , the avn triple theorem , whose proof makes use of the theory of graph states . this result enables the development of a computational method to generate all the avn arguments in $ \mathbb{z}_2 $ on n - qubit stabiliser states . we also present new insights into the stabiliser formalism and its connections with logic .
