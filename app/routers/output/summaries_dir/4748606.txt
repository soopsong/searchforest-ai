we investigate the modified trace distance measure of coherence recently introduced in [ phys . rev . a 94 , 060302(r ) ( 2016 ) ] . we show that for any single - qubit state , the modified trace norm of coherence is equal to the $ l_{1}$-norm of coherence . for any $ d$-dimensional quantum system , an analytical formula of this measure for a class of maximally coherent mixed states is provided . the trade - off relation between the coherence quantified by the new measure and the mixedness quantified by the trace norm is also discussed . furthermore , we explore the relation between the modified trace distance measure of coherence and other measures such as the $ l_{1}$-norm of coherence and the geometric measure of coherence .
