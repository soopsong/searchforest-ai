we examine weak measurements of arbitrary observables where the object is prepared in a mixed state and on which measurements with imperfect detectors are made . the weak value of an observable can be expressed as a conditional expectation value over an infinite class of different generalized kirkwood quasi - probability distributions . "strange"weak values for which the real part exceeds the eigenvalue spectrum of the observable can only be found if the terletsky - margenau - hill distribution is negative , or , equivalently , if the real part of the weak value of the density operator is negative . we find that a classical model of a weak measurement exists whenever the terletsky - margenau - hill representation of the observable equals the classical representation of the observable and the terletsky - margenau - hill distribution is nonnegative . strange weak values alone are not sufficient to obtain a contradiction with classical models . we propose feasible weak measurements of photon number of the radiation field . negative weak values of energy contradicts all classical stochastic models , whereas negative weak values of photon number contradict all classical stochastic models where the energy is bounded from below by the zero - point energy . we examine coherent states in particular , and find negative weak values with probabilities of 16 % for kinetic energy ( or squared field quadrature ) , 8 % for harmonic oscillator energy and 50 % for photon number . these experiments are robust against detector inefficiency and thermal noise .
