proposed models of closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) have been shown to enable powerful information - processing protocols . we examine the simulation of models of ctcs both by other models of ctcs and by physical systems without access to ctcs . we prove that the recently proposed transition probability ctcs ( t - ctcs ) are physically equivalent to postselection ctcs ( p - ctcs ) , in the sense that one model can simulate the other with reasonable overhead . as a consequence , their information - processing capabilities are equivalent . we also describe a method for quantum computers to simulate deutschian ctcs ( but with a reasonable overhead only in some cases ) . in cases for which the overhead is reasonable , it might be possible to perform the simulation in a table - top experiment . this approach has the benefit of resolving some ambiguities associated with the equivalent circuit model of ralph et al . furthermore , we provide an explicit form for the state of the ctc system such that it is a maximum - entropy state , as prescribed by deutsch .
