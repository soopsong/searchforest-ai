we report on thermal noise from the internal friction of dielectric coatings made from alternating layers of ta2o5 and sio2 deposited on fused silica substrates . we present calculations of the thermal noise in gravitational wave interferometers due to optical coatings , when the material properties of the coating are different from those of the substrate and the mechanical loss angle in the coating is anisotropic . the loss angle in the coatings for strains parallel to the substrate surface was determined from ringdown experiments . we measured the mechanical quality factor of three fused silica samples with coatings deposited on them . the loss angle of the coating material for strains parallel to the coated surface was found to be ( 4.2 + - 0.3)*10^(-4 ) for coatings deposited on commercially polished slides and ( 1.0 + - 0.3)*10^{-4 } for a coating deposited on a superpolished disk . using these numbers , we estimate the effect of coatings on thermal noise in the initial ligo and advanced ligo interferometers . we also find that the corresponding prediction for thermal noise in the 40 m ligo prototype at caltech is consistent with the noise data . these results are complemented by results for a different type of coating , presented in a companion paper .
