in our continuous variable quantum key distribution ( qkd ) scheme , the homodyne detection set - up requires balancing the intensity of an incident beam between two photodiodes . realistic lens systems are insufficient to provide a spatially stable focus in the presence of large spatial beam - jitter caused by atmospheric transmission . we therefore present an improved geometry for optical tapers which offer up to four times the angular tolerance of a lens . the effective area of a photodiode can thus be increased , without decreasing its bandwidth . this makes them suitable for use in our free space qkd experiment and in free space optical communication in general .
