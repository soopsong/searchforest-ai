we present a comprehensive analysis of the performance of different classes of gaussian states in the estimation of gaussian phase - insensitive dissipative channels . in particular , we investigate the optimal estimation of the damping constant and reservoir temperature . we show that , for two - mode squeezed vacuum probe states , the quantum - limited accuracy of both parameters can be achieved simultaneously . moreover , we show that for both parameters two - mode squeezed vacuum states are more efficient than either coherent , thermal or single - mode squeezed states . this suggests that at high energy regimes two - mode squeezed vacuum states are optimal within the gaussian setup . this optimality result indicates a stronger form of compatibility for the estimation of the two parameters . indeed , not only the minimum variance can be achieved at fixed probe states , but also the optimal state is common to both parameters . additionally , we explore numerically the performance of non - gaussian states for particular parameter values to find that maximally entangled states within d - dimensional cutoff subspaces perform better than any randomly sampled states with similar energy . however , we also find that states with very similar performance and energy exist with much less entanglement than the maximally entangled ones .
