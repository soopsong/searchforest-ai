the quantum discord and tripartite entanglement are discussed in the presence of an asymptotically flat static black holes . the total correlation , quantum discord and classical correlation exhibit decreasing behavior with increasing hawking temperature . it is shown that the classical correlation is less than the quantum discord in the full range of hawking temperature . the tripartite entanglements for greenberger - horne - zeilinger and w - states also exhibit decreasing behavior with increasing hawking temperature . at the infinite limit of hawking temperature the tripartite entanglements for greenberger - horne - zeilinger and w - states reduce to 52 % and 33 % of the corresponding values in the flat space limit , respectively .
