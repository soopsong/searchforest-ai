systems with coupled cavities and waveguides have been demonstrated as optical switches and optical sensors . to optimize the functionalities of these optical devices , fano resonance with asymmetric and steep spectral line shape has been used . we theoretically propose a coupled photonic crystal cavity - waveguide structure to achieve fano resonance by placing partially reflecting elements in waveguide . to enhance fano resonance , optical gain material is introduced into the cavity . as the gain increases , the transmission line shape becomes steepened and the transmissivity can be six times enhanced , giving a large contrast by a small frequency shift . it is prospected that the gain enhanced fano resonance is very useful for optical switches and optical sensors .
