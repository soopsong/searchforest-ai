the striking efficiency of energy transfer in natural photosynthetic systems and the recent evidence of long - lived quantum coherence in biological light harvesting complexes has triggered much excitement , due to the evocative possibility that these systems - essential to practically all life on earth -- use quantum mechanical effects to achieve optimal functionality . a large body of theoretical work has addressed the role of local environments in determining the transport properties of excitons in photosynthetic networks and the survival of quantum coherence in a classical environment . nonetheless , understanding the connection between quantum coherence , exciton network geometry and energy transfer efficiency remains a challenge . here we address this connection from the perspective of heat transfer within the exciton network . using a non - equilibrium open quantum system approach and focusing on the fenna - matthews - olson complex , we demonstrate that finite local dephasing can be beneficial to the overall power output . the mechanism for this enhancement of power output is identified as a gentle balance between quantum and classical contributions to the local heat flow , such that the total heat flow is directed along the shortest paths and dissipation is minimized . strongly related to the spatial network structure of the exciton transfer complex , this mechanism elucidates how energy flows in photosyntetic excitonic complexes .
