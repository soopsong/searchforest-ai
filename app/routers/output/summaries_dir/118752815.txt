with the local resonant interaction between a nitrogen - vacancy - center ensemble ( nve ) and a superconducting coplanar resonator , and the single - qubit operation , we propose two protocols for the state transfer between two remote nves and for fast controlled - phase ( c - phase ) on these nves , respectively . this hybrid quantum system is composed of two distant nves coupled to separated high - q transmission line resonators ( tlrs ) , which are interconnected by a current - biased josephsonjunction superconducting phase qubit . the fidelity of our state - transfer protocol is about 99.65 % within the operation time of 70.60 ns . the fidelity of our c - phase gate is about 98.23 % within the operation time of 93.87 ns . furthermore , using the c - phase gate , we construct a two - dimensional cluster state on nves in n*n square grid based on the hybrid quantum system for the one - way quantum computation . our protocol may be more robust , compared with the one based on the superconducting resonators , due to the long coherence time of nves at room temperature .
