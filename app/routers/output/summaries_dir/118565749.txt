we study quantum discord between two free modes of a massive scalar field in a maximally entangled state in de sitter space . we introduce two observers , one in a global chart and the other in an open chart of de sitter space , and the observers determine the quantum discord created by each detecting one of the modes . this situation is analogous to the relationship between an observer in a minkowski chart and another in one of the two rindler charts in flat space . we find that the state becomes less entangled as the curvature of the open chart gets larger . in particular , for the cases of a massless , and a conformally coupled scalar field , the entanglement vanishes in the limit of infinite curvature . however , we find that the quantum discord never disappears even in the limit that entanglement disappears .
