we consider the possibility of mining black holes in the 1 + 1-dimensional dilaton gravity model of russo , susskind and thorlacius . the model correctly incorporates hawking radiation and back - reaction in a semiclassical expansion in 1 / n , where n is the number of matter species . it is shown that the lifetime of a perturbed black hole is independent of the addition of any extra apparatus when realized by an arbitrary positive energy matter source . we conclude that mining does not occur in the rst model and comment on the implications of this for the black hole information paradox .
