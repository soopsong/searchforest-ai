we compute the decoherence caused by $ 1 / f$ fluctuations at low frequency $ f$ in the critical current $ i_0 $ of josephson junctions incorporated into flux , phase , charge and hybrid flux - charge superconducting quantum bits ( qubits ) . the dephasing time $ \tau_{\phi}$ scales as $ i_0/ \omega \lambda s_{i_0}^{1/2}(1 $ hz$)$ , where $ \omega / 2\pi$ is the energy level splitting frequency , $ s_{i_0}(1 $ hz$)$ is the spectral density of the critical current noise at 1 hz , and $ \lambda \equiv |i_0 d \omega / \omega d i_0|$ is a parameter computed for given parameters for each type of qubit that specifies the sensitivity of the level splitting to critical current fluctuations . computer simulations show that the envelope of the coherent oscillations of any qubit after time $ t$ scales as $ \exp ( -t^2/ 2 \tau_{\phi}^2)$ when the dephasing due to critical current noise dominates the dephasing from all sources of dissipation . we compile published results for fluctuations in the critical current of josephson tunnel junctions fabricated with different technologies and a wide range in $ i_0 $ and $ a$ , and show that their values of $ s_{i_0}(1 $ hz$)$ scale to within a factor of three of $ [ 144 ( i_0/\mu{\rm a})^2/ ( a/ \mu{\rm m}^2)]($pa$)^2/$hz at 4.2 k. we empirically extrapolate $ s_{i_0}^{1/2}(1 $ hz$)$ to lower temperatures using a scaling $ t($k$)/4.2$. using this result , we find that the predicted values of $ \tau_{\phi}$ at 100 mk range from 0.8 to 12 $ \mu$s , and are usually substantially longer than values measured experimentally at lower temperatures .
