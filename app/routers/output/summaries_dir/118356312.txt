the entanglement entropy of a subsystem $ a$ of a quantum system is expressed , in the replica method , through analytic continuation with respect to n of the trace of the n - th power of the reduced density matrix $ \tr\rho_a^n$. we study the analytic properties of this quantity as a function of n in some quantum critical ising - like models in 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions . although we find no true singularities for n>0 , there is a threshold value of n close to 2 which separates two very different ` phases ' . the region with larger n is characterized by rapidly convergent taylor expansions and is very smooth . the region with smaller n has a very rich and varied structure in the complex n plane and is characterized by taylor coefficients which instead of being monotone decreasing , have a maximum growing with the size of the subsystem . finite truncations of the taylor expansion in this region lead to increasingly poor approximations of $ \tr\rho_a^n$. the computation of the entanglement entropy from the knowledge of $ \tr\rho^n_a$ for positive integer n becomes extremely difficult particularly in spatial dimensions larger than one , where one can not use conformal field theory as a guidance in the extrapolations to n=1 .
