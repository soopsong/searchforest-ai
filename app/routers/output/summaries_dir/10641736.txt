we present some compact quantum circuits for a deterministic quantum computing on electron - spin qubits assisted by quantum dots inside single - side optical microcavities , including the cnot , toffoli , and fredkin gates . they are constructed by exploiting the giant optical faraday rotation induced by a single - electron spin in a quantum dot inside a single - side optical microcavity as a result of cavity quantum electrodynamics . our universal quantum gates have some advantages . first , all the gates are accomplished with a success probability of 100 % in principle . second , our schemes require no additional electron - spin qubits and they are achieved by some input - output processes of a single photon . third , our circuits for these gates are simple and economic . moreover , our devices for these gates work in both the weak coupling and the strong coupling regimes , and they are feasible in experiment .
