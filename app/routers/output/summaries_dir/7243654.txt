improving over an earlier construction by kaye and zalka , maslov et al . describe an implementation of shor 's algorithm which can solve the discrete logarithm problem on binary elliptic curves in quadratic depth o(n^2 ) . in this paper we show that discrete logarithms on such curves can be found with a quantum circuit of depth o(log^2 n ) . as technical tools we introduce quantum circuits for gf(2^n ) multiplication in depth o(log n ) and for gf(2^n ) inversion in depth o(log^2 n ) .
