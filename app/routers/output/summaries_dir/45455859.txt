we quantify the one - shot entanglement cost of an arbitrary bipartite state , that is the minimum number of singlets needed by two distant parties to create a single copy of the state up to a finite accuracy , using local operations and classical communication only . this analysis , in contrast to the traditional one , pertains to scenarios of practical relevance , in which resources are finite and transformations can only be achieved approximately . moreover , it unveils a fundamental relation between two well - known entanglement measures , namely , the schmidt number and the entanglement of formation . using this relation , we are able to recover the usual expression of the entanglement cost as a special case .
