we present a protocol to implement discrete - time quantum walks and simulate topological insulator phases in cavity - based quantum networks , where the single photon is the quantum walker and the cavity input - output process is employed to realize the state - dependent translation operation . different topological phases can be simulated through tuning the single - photon polarization rotation angles . we show that both the topological boundary states and topological phase transitions can be directly observed via measuring the final photonic density distribution . moreover , we also demonstrate that these topological signatures are quite robust to practical imperfections . our work opens a new prospect using cavity - based quantum networks as quantum simulators to study discrete - time quantum walks and mimic condensed matter physics .
