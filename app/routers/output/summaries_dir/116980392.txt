we investigate two - photon entangled states using two important degrees of freedom of the electromagnetic field , namely orbital angular momentum ( oam ) and spin angular momentum . for photons propagating in the same direction we apply the idea of $ \textit{entanglement duality}$ and develop schemes to do $ \textit{entanglement sorting}$ based either on oam or polarization . in each case the entanglement is tested using appropriate witnesses . we finally present generalizations of these ideas to three- and four - photon entangled states .
