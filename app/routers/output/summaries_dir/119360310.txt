classically , the black hole ( bh ) horizon is completely opaque , hiding any clues about the state and very existence of its interior . quantum mechanically and in equilibrium , the situation is not much different : hawking radiation will now be emitted , but it comes out at an extremely slow rate , is thermal to a high degree of accuracy and thus carries a minimal amount of information about the quantum state within the bh . here , it is shown that the situation is significantly different when a quantum bh is out of equilibrium . we argue that the bh can then emit"supersized"hawking radiation with a much larger amplitude than that emitted in equilibrium . the result is a new type of quantum hair that can reveal the state and composition of the bh interior to an external observer . moreover , the frequency and amplitude of the new hair can be explained by the observer without invoking any new physical principles . the new hair decays at a parametrically slow rate in comparison to the schwarzschild time scale and can be detected through the emission of gravitational waves ( and possibly other types of waves ) ; for example , during and after a bh - merger event . the current discussion is motivated by a previous analysis , in the context of a recently proposed polymer model for the bh interior , that implies emissions just like those described here . we expect , however , that the new hair is a model - independent property of quantum bhs .
