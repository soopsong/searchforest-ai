we consider the resonance interaction energy between two identical entangled atoms , where one is in the excited state and the other in the ground state . they interact with the quantum electromagnetic field in the vacuum state and are placed in a photonic - bandgap environment with a dispersion relation quadratic near the gap edge and linear for low frequencies , while the atomic transition frequency is assumed to be inside the photonic gap and near its lower edge . this problem is strictly related to the coherent resonant energy transfer between atoms in external environments . the analysis involves both an isotropic three - dimensional model and the one - dimensional case . the resonance interaction asymptotically decays faster with distance compared to the free - space case , specifically as $ 1 / r^2 $ compared to the $ 1 / r$ free - space dependence in the three - dimensional case , and as $ 1 / r$ compared to the oscillatory dependence in free space for the one - dimensional case . nonetheless , the interaction energy remains significant and much stronger than dispersion interactions between atoms . on the other hand , spontaneous emission is strongly suppressed by the environment and the correlated state is thus preserved by the spontaneous - decay decoherence effects . we conclude that our configuration is suitable for observing the elusive quantum resonance interaction between entangled atoms .
