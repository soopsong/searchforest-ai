in this work we examine recently proposed distance - based classification method designed for near - term quantum processing units with limited resources . we further study possibilities to reduce the quantum resources without any efficiency decrease . we show that only a part of the information undergoes coherent evolution and this fact allows us to introduce an algorithm with significantly reduced quantum memory size . additionally , considering only partial information at a time , we propose a classification protocol with information distributed among a number of agents . finally , we show that the information evolution during a measurement can lead to a better solution and that accuracy of the algorithm can be improved by harnessing the state after the final measurement .
