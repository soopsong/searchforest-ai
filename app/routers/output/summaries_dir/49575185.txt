an all - optical scheme for simulating non - markovian evolution of a quantum system is proposed . it uses only linear optics elements and by controlling the system parameters allows one to control the presence or absence of information backflow from the environment . a sufficient and necessary condition for the non - markovianity of our channel based on gaussian inputs is proved . various criteria for detecting non - markovianity are also investigated by checking the dynamical evolution of the channel .
