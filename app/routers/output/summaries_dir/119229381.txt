we identify a key difference between quantum search by discrete- and continuous - time quantum walks : a discrete - time walk typically performs one walk step per oracle query , whereas a continuous - time walk can effectively perform multiple walk steps per query while only counting query time . as a result , we show that continuous - time quantum walks can outperform their discrete - time counterparts , even though both achieve quadratic speedups over their corresponding classical random walks . to provide greater equity , we allow the discrete - time quantum walk to also take multiple walk steps per oracle query while only counting queries . then it matches the continuous - time algorithm 's runtime , but such that it is a cubic speedup over its corresponding classical random walk . this yields the first example of a greater - than - quadratic speedup for quantum search over its corresponding classical random walk .
