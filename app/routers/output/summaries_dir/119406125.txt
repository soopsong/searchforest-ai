it is sketched how a monostable rf- or dc - squid can mediate an inductive coupling between two adjacent flux qubits . the nontrivial dependence of the squid 's susceptibility on external flux makes it possible to continuously tune the induced coupling from antiferromagnetic ( af ) to ferromagnetic ( fm ) . in particular , for suitable parameters , the induced fm coupling can be sufficiently large to overcome any possible direct af inductive coupling between the qubits . the main features follow from a classical analysis of the multi - qubit potential . a fully quantum treatment yields similar results , but with a modified expression for the squid susceptibility . since the latter is exact , it can also be used to evaluate the susceptibility -- or , equivalently , energy - level curvature -- of an isolated rf - squid for larger shielding and at degenerate flux bias , i.e. , a ( bistable ) qubit . the result is compared to the standard two - level ( pseudospin ) treatment of the anticrossing , and the ensuing conclusions are verified numerically .
