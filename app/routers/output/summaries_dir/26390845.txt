we propose a continuous - variable measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution ( cv - mdi qkd ) protocol , in which detection is conducted by an untrusted third party . our protocol can defend all detector side channels , which seriously threaten the security of a practical cv qkd system . its security analysis against arbitrary collective attacks is derived based on the fact that the entanglement - based scheme of cv - mdi qkd is equivalent to the conventional cv qkd with coherent states and heterodyne detection . we find that the maximal total transmission distance is achieved by setting the untrusted third party close to one of the legitimate users . furthermore , an alternate detection scheme , a special application of cv - mdi qkd , is proposed to enhance the security of the standard cv qkd system .
