in this lecture we present a brief outline of boson fock space stochastic calculus based on the creation , conservation and annihilation operators of free field theory , as given in the 1984 paper of hudson and parthasarathy . we show how a part of this architecture yields gaussian fields stationary under a group action . then we introduce the notion of semigroups of quasifree completely positive maps on the algebra of all bounded operators in the boson fock space $ \gamma ( \mathbb{c}^n)$ over $ \mathbb{c}^n.$ these semigroups are not strongly continuous but their preduals map gaussian states to gaussian states . they were first introduced and their generators were shown to be of the lindblad type by vanheuverzwijn . they were recently investigated in the context of quantum information theory by heinosaari , holevo and wolf . here we present the exact noisy schr\"odinger equation which dilates such a semigroup to a quantum gaussian markov process .
