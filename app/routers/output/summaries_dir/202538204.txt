along with the growing interest in using the transverse - spatial modes of light in quantum and classical optics applications , developing an accurate and efficient measurement method has gained importance . here , we present a technique relying on a unitary mode conversion for measuring any full - field transverse - spatial mode . our method only requires three consecutive phase modulations followed by a single mode fiber and is , in principle , error - free and lossless . we experimentally test the technique using a single spatial light modulator and achieve an average error of 4.2 % for a set of 9 different full - field laguerre - gauss and hermite - gauss modes with an efficiency of up to 70 % . moreover , as the method can also be used to measure any complex superposition state , we demonstrate its potential in a quantum cryptography protocol and in high - dimensional quantum state tomography .
