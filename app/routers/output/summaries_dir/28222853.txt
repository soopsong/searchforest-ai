we estimate the success probability of quantum protocols composed of clifford operations in the presence of pauli errors . our method is derived from the fault - point formalism previously used to determine the success rate of low - distance error correction codes . here we apply it to a wider range of quantum protocols and identify circuit structures that allow for efficient calculation of the exact success probability and even the final distribution of output states . as examples , we apply our method to the bernstein - vazirani algorithm and the steane [ [ 7,1,3 ] ] quantum error correction code and compare the results to monte carlo simulations .
