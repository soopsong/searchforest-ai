the discrete - time quantum walk dynamics can be generated by a time - dependent hamiltonian , repeatedly switching between the coin and the shift generators . we change the model and consider the case where the hamiltonian is time - independent , including both the coin and the shift terms in all times . the eigenvalues and the related bloch vectors for the time - independent hamiltonian are then compared with the corresponding quantities for the effective hamiltonian generating the quantum walk dynamics . restricted to the non - localized initial quantum walk states , we optimize the parameters in the time - independent hamiltonian such that it generates a dynamics similar to the hadamard quantum walk . we find that the dynamics of the walker probability distribution and the corresponding standard deviation , the coin - walker entanglement , and the quantum - to - classical transition of the discrete - time quantum walk model can be approximately generated by the optimized time - independent hamiltonian . we , further , show both dynamics are equivalent in the classical regime , as expected .
