we explore the conditions under which identical particles in unitary linear networks behave as the other species , i.e. bosons as fermions and fermions as bosons . it is found that the boson - sampling computer of aaronson&arkhipov can be implemented in an interference experiment with non - interacting fermions in an appropriately entangled state . moreover , a scheme is proposed which simulates the scattershot version of the boson - sampling computer by preparing , on the fly , the required entangled state of fermions from an unentangled one .
