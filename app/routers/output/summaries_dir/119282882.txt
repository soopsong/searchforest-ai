the measurement of photon - number statistics of fields composed of photon pairs , generated in spontaneous parametric down - conversion and detected by an intensified ccd camera is described . final quantum detection efficiencies , electronic noises , finite numbers of detector pixels , transverse intensity spatial profiles of the detected beams as well as losses of single photons from a pair are taken into account in a developed general theory of photon - number detection . the measured data provided by an iccd camera with single - photon detection sensitivity are analyzed along the developed theory . joint signal - idler photon - number distributions are recovered using the reconstruction method based on the principle of maximum likelihood . the range of applicability of the method is discussed . the reconstructed joint signal - idler photon - number distribution is compared with that obtained by a method that uses superposition of signal and noise and minimizes photoelectron entropy . statistics of the reconstructed fields are identified to be multi - mode gaussian . elements of the measured as well as the reconstructed joint signal - idler photon - number distributions violate classical inequalities . sub - shot - noise correlations in the difference of the signal and idler photon numbers as well as partial suppression of odd elements in the distribution of the sum of signal and idler photon numbers are observed .
