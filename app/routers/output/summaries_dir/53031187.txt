quantum interference , like hong - ou - mandel interference , has played an important role to test fundamental concepts in quantum physics . we experimentally show that the multiple quantum interference effects enable the generation of high - performance polarization entangled photons . these photons have a high - emission rate , are degenerate , have a broadband distribution , and are postselection free . a quantum interferometric scheme , based on a round - trip configuration of a double - pass polarization sagnac interferometer , makes it possible to use the large generation efficiency of polarization entangled photons in the process of parametric down - conversion and to separate degenerate photon pairs into different optical modes with no requirement of postselection . we demonstrate experimentally that multiple quantum interference is not only an interesting fundamental quantum optical phenomenon but can be used for novel photonic quantum information technologies .
