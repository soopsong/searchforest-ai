using amplitude equations , we show that groups of identical nano - mechanical resonators , interacting with a common mode of a cavity microwave field , synchronize to form a single mechanical mode which couples to the cavity with a strength dependent on the square sum of the individual mechanical - microwave couplings . classically this system is dominated by periodic behaviour which , when analyzed using amplitude equations , can be shown to exhibit multi - stability . in contrast groups of sufficiently dissimilar nano - mechanical oscillators may lose synchronization and oscillate out of phase at significantly higher amplitudes . further the method by which synchronization is lost resembles that for large amplitude forcing which is not of the kuramoto form .
