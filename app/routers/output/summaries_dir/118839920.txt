the anisotropic quantum heisenberg model with curie - weiss - type interactions is studied analytically in several variants of the microcanonical ensemble . ( non)equivalence of microcanonical and canonical ensembles is investigated by studying the concavity properties of entropies . the microcanonical entropy s(e , m ) is obtained as a function of the energy e and the magnetization vector m in the thermodynamic limit . since , for this model , e is uniquely determined by m , the same information can be encoded either in s(m ) or s(e , m1,m2 ) . although these two entropies correspond to the same physical setting of fixed e and m , their concavity properties differ . the entropy s_h(u ) , describing the model at fixed total energy u and in a homogeneous external magnetic field h of arbitrary direction , is obtained by reduction from the nonconcave entropy s(e , m1,m2 ) . in doing so , concavity , and therefore equivalence of ensembles , is restored . s_h(u ) has nonanalyticities on surfaces of co - dimension 1 in the ( u , h)-space . projecting these surfaces into lower - dimensional phase diagrams , we observe that the resulting phase transition lines are situated in the positive - temperature region for some parameter values , and in the negative - temperature region for others . in the canonical setting of a system coupled to a heat bath of positive temperatures , the nonanalyticities in the microcanonical negative - temperature region can not be observed , and this leads to a situation of effective nonequivalence even when formal equivalence holds .
