we construct the exchange gate with small elementary gates on the space of qudits , which consist of three controlled shift gates and three"reverse"gates . this is a natural extension of the qubit case . we also consider a similar subject on the fock space , but in this case we meet with some different situation . however we can construct the exchange gate by making use of generalized coherent operator based on the lie algebra su(2 ) which is a well -- known method in quantum optics . we moreover make a brief comment on"imperfect clone " .
