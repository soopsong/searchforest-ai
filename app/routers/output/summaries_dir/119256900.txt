the current scenario of black hole evaporation holds that the hawking energy flux $ f$ is powered by pair creation at the horizon . however , pair creation produces entanglements , some of which must necessarily be broken before the black hole evaporates completely . that leads to loss of information and violation of unitarity . in this paper , an alternative scenario is suggested that reproduces the essential features of hawking evaporation , but does not invoke pair creation with its attendant problems . in this"accreting boulware"scenario , a positive flux $ f$ is still an outflux at infinity , but near the horizon it becomes an influx of negative energy . this negative energy flux ( marginally ) satisfies the flanagan energy inequality .
