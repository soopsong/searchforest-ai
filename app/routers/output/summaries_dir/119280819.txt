the optical nondestructive method for in situ detection of the bound states of ultracold polar molecules is developed . it promises a minimally destructive measurement scheme up to a physically exciting quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) level . the detection of molecular complexes beyond simple pairs of quantum particles ( dimers , known , e.g. , from the bec - bcs theory ) is suggested , including three - body ( trimers ) and four - body ( tertramers ) complexes trapped by one - dimensional tubes . the intensity of scattered light is sensitive to the molecule number fluctuations beyond the mean - density approximation . such fluctuations are very different for various complexes , which leads to radically different light scattering . this type of research extends"quantum optics of quantum gases"to the field of ultracold molecules . merging the quantum optical and ultracold gas problems will advance the experimental efforts towards the study of the light - matter interaction at its ultimate quantum level , where the quantizations of both light and matter are equally important .
