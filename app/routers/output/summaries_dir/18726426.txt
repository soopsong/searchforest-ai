we propose a simple architecture based on multimode quantum memories for collective readout of classical information keyed using a pair coherent states , exemplified by the well - known binary phase shift keying format . such a configuration enables demonstration of the superadditivity effect in classical communication over quantum channels , where the transmission rate becomes enhanced through joint detection applied to multiple channel uses . the proposed scheme relies on the recently introduced idea to prepare hadamard sequences of input symbols that are mapped by a linear optical transformation onto the pulse position modulation format [ guha , s. { \em phys . rev . lett.}\ { \bf 2011 } , { \em 106 } , 240502 ] . we analyze two versions of readout based on direct detection and an optional dolinar receiver which implements the minimum - error measurement for individual detection of a binary coherent state alphabet .
