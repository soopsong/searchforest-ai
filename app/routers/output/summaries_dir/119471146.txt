like a three - qubit greenberger - horne - zeilinger(ghz ) symmetry we explore a corresponding symmetry in the four - qubit system , which we call ghz$_4 $ symmetry . while whole ghz - symmetric states can be represented by two real parameters , the whole set of the ghz$_4$-symmetric states is represented by three real parameters . in the parameter space all ghz$_4$-symmetric states reside inside a tetrahedron . we also explore a question where the given slocc class of the ghz$_4$-symmetric states resides in the tetrahedron . among nine slocc classes we have examined five slocc classes , which results in three linear hierarchies $ l_{abc_2 } \subset l_{a_4 } \subset l_{a_2b_2 } \subset g_{abcd}$ , $ l_{a_20_{3\oplus\bar{1 } } } \subset g_{abcd}$ , and $ l_{0_{3\oplus\bar{1}}0_{3\oplus\bar{1 } } } \subset g_{abcd}$ which hold , at least , in the whole set of the ghz$_4$-symmetric states . difficulties arising in the analysis of the remaining slocc classes are briefly discussed .
