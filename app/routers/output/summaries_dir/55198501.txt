the purposes of this work are ( 1 ) to show that the appropriate generalizations of the oscillator algebra permit the construction of a wide set of nonlinear coherent states in unified form ; and ( 2 ) to clarify the likely contradiction between the nonclassical properties of such nonlinear coherent states and the possibility of finding a classical analog for them since they are p - represented by a delta function . in ( 1 ) we prove that a class of nonlinear coherent states can be constructed to satisfy a closure relation that is expressed uniquely in terms of the meijer g - function . this property automatically defines the delta distribution as the p - representation of such states . then , in principle , there must be a classical analog for them . among other examples , we construct a family of nonlinear coherent states for a representation of the su(1,1 ) lie algebra that is realized as a deformation of the oscillator algebra . in ( 2 ) , we use a beam splitter to show that the nonlinear coherent states exhibit properties like anti - bunching that prohibit a classical description for them . we also show that these states lack second order coherence . that is , although the p - representation of the nonlinear coherent states is a delta function , they are not full coherent . therefore , the systems associated with the generalized oscillator algebras can not be considered ` classical ' in the context of the quantum theory of optical coherence .
