we extend the work in new j. phys . 19 , 103015 ( 2017 ) by deriving a lower bound for the minimum time necessary to implement a unitary transformation on a generic , closed quantum system with an arbitrary number of classical control fields . this bound is explicitly analyzed for a specific n - level system similar to those used to represent simple models of an atom , or the first excitation sector of a heisenberg spin chain , both of which are of interest in quantum control for quantum computation . specifically , it is shown that the resultant bound depends on the dimension of the system , and on the number of controls used to implement a specific target unitary operation . the value of the bound determined numerically , and an estimate of the true minimum gate time are systematically compared for a range of system dimension and number of controls ; special attention is drawn to the relationship between these two variables . it is seen that the bound captures the scaling of the minimum time well for the systems studied , and quantitatively is correct in the order of magnitude .
