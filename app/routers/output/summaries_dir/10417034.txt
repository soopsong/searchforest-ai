we present a c - function for spherically symmetric , static and asymptotically flat solutions in theories of four - dimensional gravity coupled to gauge fields and moduli . the c - function is valid for both extremal and non - extremal black holes . it monotonically decreases from infinity and in the static region acquires its minimum value at the horizon , where it equals the entropy of the black hole . higher dimensional cases , involving $ p$-form gauge fields , and other generalisations are also discussed .
