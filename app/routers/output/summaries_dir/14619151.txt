stochastic systems in biology often exhibit substantial variability within and between cells . this variability , as well as having dramatic functional consequences , provides information about the underlying details of the system 's behaviour . it is often desirable to infer properties of the parameters governing such systems given experimental observations of the mean and variance of observed quantities . in some circumstances , analytic forms for the likelihood of these observations allow very efficient inference : we present these forms and demonstrate their usage . when likelihood functions are unavailable or difficult to calculate , we show that an implementation of approximate bayesian computation ( abc ) is a powerful tool for parametric inference in these systems . however , the calculations required to apply abc to these systems can also be computationally expensive , relying on repeated stochastic simulations . we propose an abc approach that cheaply eliminates unimportant regions of parameter space , by addressing computationally simple mean behaviour before explicitly simulating the more computationally demanding variance behaviour . we show that this approach leads to a substantial increase in speed when applied to synthetic and experimental datasets .
