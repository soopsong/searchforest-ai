we study feedback control of coupled nonlinear stochastic oscillators in a force field . we first consider the problem of asymptotically driving the system to a desired { \em steady state } corresponding to reduced thermal noise . among the feedback controls achieving the desired asymptotic transfer , we find that the most efficient one { from an energy point of view } is characterized by { \em time - reversibility } . we also extend the theory of schr\"{o}dinger bridges to this model , thereby steering the system in { \em finite time } and with minimum effort to a target steady - state distribution . the system can then be maintained in this state through the optimal steady - state feedback control . the solution , in the finite - horizon case , involves a space - time harmonic function $ \varphi$ , and $ -\log\varphi$ plays the role of an artificial , time - varying potential in which the desired evolution occurs . this framework appears extremely general and flexible and can be viewed as a considerable generalization of existing active control strategies such as macromolecular cooling . in the case of a quadratic potential , the results assume a form particularly attractive from the algorithmic viewpoint as the optimal control can be computed via deterministic matricial differential equations . an example involving inertial particles illustrates both transient and steady state optimal feedback control .
