we demonstrate a compact photon pair source based on a periodically poled lithium niobate nonlinear crystal in a cavity . the cavity parameters are chosen such that the emitted photon pair modes can be matched in the region of telecom ultra dense wavelength division multiplexing ( u - dwdm ) channel spacings . this approach provides efficient , low - loss , mode selection that is compatible with standard telecommunication networks . photons with a coherence time of 8.6 ns ( 116 mhz ) are produced and their purity is demonstrated . a source brightness of 134 pairs(s.mw.mhz)$^{-1}$ is reported . the high level of purity and compatibility with standard telecom networks is of great importance for complex quantum communication networks .
