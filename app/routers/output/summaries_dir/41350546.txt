the derivation of general performance benchmarks is important in the design of highly optimized heat engines and refrigerators . to obtain them , one may model phenomenologically the leading sources of irreversibility ending up with results which are model - independent , but limited in scope . alternatively , one can take a simple physical system realizing a thermodynamic cycle and assess its optimal operation from a complete microscopic description . we follow this approach in order to derive the coefficient of performance at maximum cooling rate for \textit{any } endoreversible quantum refrigerator . at striking variance with the \textit{universality } of the optimal efficiency of heat engines , we find that the cooling performance at maximum power is crucially determined by the details of the specific system - bath interaction mechanism . a closed analytical benchmark is found for endoreversible refrigerators weakly coupled to unstructured bosonic heat baths : an ubiquitous case study in quantum thermodynamics .
