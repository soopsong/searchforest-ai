cryptanalysis is an important branch in the study of cryptography , including both the classical cryptography and the quantum one . in this paper we analyze the security of two three - party quantum key distribution protocols ( qkdps ) proposed recently , and point out that they are susceptible to a simple and effective attack , i.e. the dense - coding attack . it is shown that the eavesdropper eve can totally obtain the session key by sending entangled qubits as the fake signal to alice and performing collective measurements after alice 's encoding . the attack process is just like a dense - coding communication between eve and alice , where a special measurement basis is employed . furthermore , this attack does not introduce any errors to the transmitted information and consequently will not be discovered by alice and bob . the attack strategy is described in detail and a proof for its correctness is given . at last , the root of this insecurity and a possible way to improve these protocols are discussed .
