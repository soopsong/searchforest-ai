we develop a general dynamical theory for studying a single photon transport in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) waveguide coupled to multiple emitters which can be either identical or non - identical . in this theory , both the effects of the waveguide and non - waveguide vacuum modes are included . this theory enables us to investigate the propagation of an emitter excitation or an arbitrary single photon pulse along an array of emitters coupled to a 1d waveguide . the dipole - dipole interaction induced by the non - waveguide modes , which is usually neglected in the literatures , can significantly modify the dynamics of the emitter system as well as the characteristics of output field if the emitter separation is much smaller than the resonance wavelength . non - identical emitters can also strongly couple to each other if their energy difference is smaller than or of the order of the dipole - dipole energy shift . interestingly , if their energy difference is close but non - zero , a very narrow transparency window around the resonance frequency can appear which does not occur for identical emitters . this phenomenon may find important applications in quantum waveguide devices such as optical switch and ultra narrow single photon frequency comb generator .
